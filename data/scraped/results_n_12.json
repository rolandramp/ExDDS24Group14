        "Agree with my colleagues that a pre-approval letter should be fine, you just cannot incur a debt without a court order authorizing you to do so while your case is still open. For that, you would have to file a motion to incur debt. However, if you already made your last payment, you might be better off waiting for your discharge to avoid additional attorney fees and costs. Congratulations on completing your chapter 13 bankruptcy case!",
        "A pre approval shouldn't be a problem, however actually closing a loan is another matter. Many California bankruptcy courts require court approval to borrow money while you are still in your bk case, which you may not wish to wait or pay for.\nYou should discuss this with your attorney.",
        "Only your lender knows for sure. If you can find a lender to pre approve you while you are in the administrative closing stages of a 13, then fine, have at it. One thing is most likely very certain, you cannot get approved for the actual loan, while the 13 is still open/not discharged. Getting approval during an open 13 is not impossible, but can create many difficulties, depending on your local jurisdiction, your trustee, and your plan. So, right, get pre approved, if you can, and hold the actual approval until your case is officially over. JCC",
        "Probably not. To be certain, ask your BK lawyer and the proposed lender.",
        "First, discuss with your attorney if you have one.\n\nSecond, many jurisdictions court order's or plan prohibits incurring new debt during the case. Thus, if by doing that you are not incurring new debt then I see no problem at all. Its like looking at what type of car/truck you want to buy etc. If however, something obligates you to pay something then that would be new debt. Congrats on finishing the ch 13 and make sure you have filed the 2nd class with the Court and filed the DSO statement in form that your trustee requires. Good luck."

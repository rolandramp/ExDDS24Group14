    "title": "Would doing a prenup with my fiancé protect my assets And income if he goes bankrupt or can’t pay child support?",
    "question": "My fiancé had issues with his ex girlfriend who fought him in court for 5 years because she didn’t want to give up custody or child support for her daughter. He might have to file bankruptcy after all the lawyer bills. We are getting married and I need to understand if he filed bankruptcy will it affect my income or assets if we have a prenup? If we have a prenup, Can the courts come after my income or assets if he can’t pay child support for some reason?",

        "Only community property and the separate property of the spouse filing a bankruptcy become assets of the Bankruptcy Estate. Your separate property is not at risk in your spouse's bankruptcy case.\nAn experienced family law attorney will help you draft a prenup that will distinguish separate property from community (and quasi community) property assets acquired after marriage and counsel you on asset transmutation law during marriage.",
        "The premarital agreement may assist in providing protection that you need. I urge you to discuss this with an experienced family law attorney in more detail. Importantly in your planning is timing. If bankruptcy appears to be imminent, or even if it is a possibility, meeting with an experienced bankruptcy attorney to receive more detailed information and analysis of options is critical, and serious consideration should be given to whether it is a better idea for him to file before your marriage. Why wait until after you are married to try to resolve all these issues rather than waiting for the other shoe to fall. You should be involved in all\nthese conversations as it affects you as well. These considerations take time so if the wedding is imminent, postponement would be prudent to get the information you both need.",
        "On the day of your wedding, everything you and your fiance own already is separate property and will remain such unless you would like to change it or you apply post-marital earnings and efforts to pay for it or to manage it. But your earnings will be community property, and subject to garnishment by your fiance's creditors, including the ex-girlfriend.\n\nTo preserve everything you own and earn as separate property to prevent your fiance's creditors from enforcing claims attributable to him against your property or earnings, you need a carefully drafted prenuptial agreement.\n\nYou should confer with counsel familiar not only with bankruptcy law, but also family law, since the drafting of such agreements often is entrusted to family law attorneys, but not all are well-versed in creditor/debtor law.",
        "Yes, one can draft an enforceable premarital agreement which changes the character of your income post-marriage.\n\nYou would probably take new assets during the marriage in your name only, if you wanted it to remain separate. It sounds like you would want the agreement to provide that any assets you own before the marriage would remain separate property, even if you use post-marriage income to make payments or maintain it..\n\nIn that event, creditors or a bankruptcy trustee would not be able to come after your income or assets as community property.",
        "A pre-nup will confirm the assets you each have and in the event of his possible BK would give you greater protection. The bigger question is, with his history with his ex, do you really want to proceed with the marriage? This seems like a huge red flag. Assuming he is the father of the child, fighting paying child support appears to expose a serious character flaw."

    "title": "How can I get my student loan out of collections?",
    "question": "Since I graduated I was unemployed 3 times. 1 reason being medically. Every time I tried to do a repayment prgm. it seemed like Sallie Mae wouldn't work with me. Now my account is in collections. I have someone calling my entire family (in laws included) saying they're an associate of mine and need my location, job, and other info. My wife doesn't work she is currently going to school and we have two kids. My wife contacted the collector to make a payment arrangement. She gave them my income and list of current bills. They told her we have to pay a deposit of 5,000 then weekly payments of 500. We obviously can't afford that. So the collector said weekly deposit payments of 320 for 12 weeks then weekly payments of 85. My wife said let me talk to my husband about it they told her legally you're married you have a right to authorize payments. So she did, After calling back less than five minutes later to rearrange the payment because she felt bullied into it knowing we can't afford it the collector told her she doesn't have a right to cancel or rearrange payments. They have charged me twice now and both payments were declined because I can't afford it. What are my options now.",

        "You do not say whether the student loan is a federal loan or a private loan. That's an important fact that will determine your rights. Federal student loans are subject to the laws and regulations that apply to those loans. A federal student loan goes into default if the borrower runs out of deferments and forebearances and does not get into a payment plan. Once a borrower is in default he can apply to \"rehabilitate\" the loan, which entails making an on-time affordable payment for 10 months over one year. Unless the borrower has gone through the rehab process before, he cannot be denied the affordable payment or bullied into agreeing to a high, un-affordable payment.\n\nOn the other hand if the loan was a PRIVATE student loan through Sallie Mae or another lender, those rules do not apply. I would not give any weight to the statements the the initial amount proposed on the phone ($340 a month) is set in stone, especially since the agreement did not involve YOU, the borrower! A debt collector cannot force you to voluntarily make a payment if you cannot afford the payment.\n\nIt sounds like this debt collector made false statements and employed unfair tactics. If this is a PRIVATE loan and you want to continue with efforts to resolve the debt, you may want to discuss with an attorney that handles student loan issues.",
        "I suggest you make a complaint to the Federal Consumer Protection Agency. Here is a link to their web site, https://www.consumerfinance.gov/complaint/\n\nThey are very down on student lenders right now.",
        "If the payments were declined, then it sounds like you're pretty much in the same position that you were in prior to entering into the payment arrangement. Your options are to enter into a payment arrangement, or settlement, with the debt collectors, otherwise they will likely continue the collection process. If you currently cannot afford to pay them anything, then there's not much else to do. Collectors aren't looking to hear why you can't pay, they are looking to hear what you CAN pay. If you can pay a reasonable amount, call the collectors and see if they'll work with you. If you can't pay, then call them when your circumstances change for the better. If you're having difficulty in communicating with the collectors, you may seek an attorney to represent you. Good luck!"

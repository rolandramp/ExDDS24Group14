    "title": "How can I get help organizing information to report suspected bankruptcy fraud?",
    "question": "I plan to report suspected bankruptcy fraud in which an individual intentionally reduced their income in order to qualify for bankruptcy and also engaged in other activities that are questionable for someone going through bankruptcy. This doesn't seem like a typical fraud case where someone is hiding assets. I have a significant amount of information in the form of legal filings, insurance claims, and deposition transcripts. How should I go about finding an attorney who can help me prepare and present the information in the best way possible? I am willing to pay typical attorney fees for several hours of work.",

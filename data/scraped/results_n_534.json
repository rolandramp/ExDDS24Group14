        "Unless you have joint debts, the answer is no. But if you do have joint debts then depending on your overall financial situation, Bankruptcy may be right for you. An experienced CA Bankruptcy attorney will be able to determine which type of Bankruptcy is the correct one for you. Use AVVO's Find a Lawyer tool to select a qualified attorney. Good luck. THIS IS NOT LEGAL ADVICE! YOU NEED TO SPEAK TO AN ATTORNEY WHO IS LICENSED IN YOUR STATE FOR LEGAL ADVICE. This is merely suggestions for you to think about in discussing your situation with the local attorney.",

    "title": "In Chapter 7 bankruptcy, can the IRS and CA FTB offset my refunds on a dischargeable tax debt?",
    "question": "This is apparently a tough question, and I need an answer from someone in the 9th District. I have tax debts from 2013 (IRS and California). I filed those tax returns 7 months late, but I did file them, and no Substitute for Return was filed. (I received a refund, but I had inadvertently omitted a W-2, so I was audited a few months later, and ended up owing.) I satisfy the 3-year rule, the 2-year rule, and the 245-day rule, so the debts are dischargeable. I filed for bankruptcy in May, but I just learned that I was eligible for the Earned Income Tax Credit, so I filed IRS and CA FTB returns. Both refunds were immediately offset to the 2013 tax debt, in violation of the Stay? Main question: The Trustee has already filed a Notice of No Distribution. Do I need to amend my BK Schedules to show these just-filed tax returns and exempt them? (The total is only $400, and I doubt the Trustee would be interested.) In hindsight, I should have waited to file the returns. Once the debts are discharged, will I be able to get my tax refunds back? Will it matter whether or not I exempted them? Iâ€™ve spent hours reading, and every court has had a different opinion. Help!",

        "You definitely need an attorney.\n\nOnce a debt is discharged, it should be gone and non-collectible, so I don't see how the IRS or Trustee can collect on it.\n\nHowever, you must be able to show that you revealed all material information. You don't want anyone contending that your discharge was based on fraud or deceit.\n\nIf the new returns don't change any of the steps that you successfully took to discharge the prior debts, you should be OK.\n\nBUT GET A LAWYER ASAP!!\n\nGood luck",
        "If the IRS's right to attach your refund arose before the day your bankruptcy was filed, then it is fair game. Sorry, it's a bummer, I know.",
        "You can amend Schedule B, personal property, to list the tax refund. Amend Schedule C to exempt tax refund. Make the assertion that tax debt is a general unsecured debt and that you are entitled to the exemption. This is not to say that the taxing authorities won't put up a fight.",
        "Your issue is more about the tax refund and timing. So, when you filed in May, you were already due your refund. Your refund for your 2020 return becomes due as January 1, 2021. Since you filed after the year started, it doesn't matter if your taxes were dischargable, the money was already due to you. Since you owed tax money, the funds were offset. It only becomes officially once the tax return is filed so they can calculate the amount due.\n\nYour question about waiting to file the returns, sort of shows the thought process. If someone knew they were filing bankruptcy, they could just wait to file multiple years of taxes after the discharge. The money belongs to the taxing authority.",
        "You can amend your schedules and see what the IRS does, However, if you are arguing over a $400.00 offset, I'd say let it go. You will spend more money fighting over it."

    "title": "Lobel Financial recently started to garnish my wages for a car they repossessed 19 yrs ago!!! Single mom, only income!!!!!",
    "question": "Lobel Financial repossessed my car in Oct, 1995. They filed a lawsuit on April 1996. I never was served any notification of a lawsuit against me. They refiled the claim in April 2005. After 9 years later, they are now garnishing my wages. I called Lobel Financial to find out why was I not notified of any lawsuit. They told me I was notified, they have all the court documents they sent to my house with my signature. The address they have on file has been invalid for 19 years. I was never notified of any judgment. On Sept 12, 2014 is when I was notified by my employer (when I received my check stub) my wages were being garnished by Lobel Financial. This company notified my employer on August 28, 2014.",

        "You can file a motion to vacate the judgment for improper service of summons and prove you were never served and have a meritorious defense. Then when the judge vacates the judgment the creditor would have to serve you again. At this point if the creditor actually did serve a summons you would use the Statute of Limitations as a defense to get the case dismissed. You might want to get an attorney to help you do this.",
        "Because the car was repossessed in 1995, a lawsuit filed in 1996 was timely and within the 4-year statute of limitations. The issue then became whether or not you were properly served. You indicated that the address on file at Lobel Financial has been invalid for 19 years, which would take you back to 1995. If you were not properly served, you may have a basis to move to set aside the judgment so that you can offer a defense to the deficiency claim after the car was repossessed.\n\nYou also mentioned that Lobel Financial refiled the claim in April 2005, suggesting that the judgment obtained was renewed before the 10 year deadline, as it would otherwise have lapsed. You have not indicated how you learned of the renewal, but given the passage of almost 20 years, should you file a motion to vacate the judgment, you would likely be asked why you did not take such a step in 2005 when you learned the judgment had been renewed. If you have known of the existence of the judgment for nine years or longer, the court may deny a request to set aside the judgment based on a doctrine known as \"laches\", for failure to act more promptly.\n\nIn any event, while you may have a procedural defense that requires the judgment be set aside, do you have a substantive defense to the claim for the deficiency after the sale of the car? In other words, did you pay the deficiency or was it not a valid claim? If not, the court may still entered judgment against you for the unpaid deficiency after a trial. Without knowing if you have other claims, you may wish to consider discharging the debt in bankruptcy.",
        "You could file a motion to vacate which, if successful, would allow you to file an answer. If you have other debts and limited income, now might be time to file a Chapter 7 or 13 bankruptcy. Without knowing more I couldn't say if it would be a good idea. I can say a Chapter 7 could wipe out this debt for less money than it would cost to set aside or vacate this judgment. Call an OC bankruptcy attorney for a free consult. There are a lot of them here on Avvo.\n\nGood luck!\n\nRob",
        "Because they filed their lawsuit within the Statute of Limitations, the SOL does not apply in your case. What you should do is to file a motion to vacate the judgment based upon lack of personal jurisdiction. This may be a difficult motion because of the amount of time that has passed. If you know that there was a lawsuit (such as by checking your credit reports), or received a collection phone call, the creditor will argue that you waited too long to bring a motion to vacate. What you need to do first is to go to the courthouse and get copies of the relevant records, including the Proof of Service. then, consult an attorney who regularly represents consumers and discuss filing a motion to vacate, filing a Claim of Exemption or BK. You need to be advised as to all of your options, not just BK.\nAlso, do not believe anything that a debt collector tells you. Assume that the person you are talking to on the phone will get paid only out of whatever money is collected from you. You will not be able to negotiate anything with the collector, so do not spend you time talking with them. They will just mis quote you in court papers."

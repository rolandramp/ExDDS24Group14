        "As long as you live in the US, you are eligible to file a bankruptcy. However, you are required to list all assets you own, even if they are located outside of the US.\n\nHope this perspective helps!",

        "You do not need to be a U.S. citizen to file a bankruptcy case. However, all your assets, wherever located on the planet are subject to the control of your U.S. bankruptcy trustee. If you have assets in a foreign country and are thinking of bankruptcy, locate the most sophisticated bankruptcy attorney you can find to handle the matter. Assets in exotic locations are like a red flag before a trustee and things can get very complicated very fast."

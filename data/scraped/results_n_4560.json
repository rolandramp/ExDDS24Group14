    "question": "I received a Memorandum of costs after judgment, acknowledgement of credit, and declaration of accrued interest from Lang, Richert & Patch (Unifund CCR) It's around $3,500.00 I have been making solid payments monthly to them and have fallen back a couple of months because of financial hardship. Do I need to hire a lawyer to deal with this or can this be handled simply by contacting them and explaining the situation. I am scared and don't know what to do. If I had money for an attorney I would hire one but I don't. PLEASE HELP....SOME ADVICE would be greatly appreciated.",

        "A memorandum of costs after judgment means that the plaintiff has a judgment against you, because a response was not filed by you or your lawyer, to protect against that occurrence. You should consult immediately with a debt collection DEFENSE lawyer and review my blog posting that explains the options when a default judgment is obtained by the plaintiff in a debt collection lawsuit. My blog is linked, below. In particular, your next move will need to be setting aside this default judgment promptly, either because you were not properly served with the lawsuit, because you had an understanding with the plaintiff's counsel that they would not seek a default judgment while you made the payments, or because you made a mistaken understanding that the payments meant that they would not seek a default judgment. Being prompt is the key, I doubt a phone call will be any use and often the phone calls are twisted around to make it appear that you agreed to whatever they want, so they can tell the judge what they claim you said.\n\nRobert Stempler (please see DISCLAIMER below)\nwww.StopCollectionLawsuits.com\nwww.facebook.com/SoCalConsumerLawyer\nTwitter: @RStempler",

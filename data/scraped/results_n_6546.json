    "title": "Who determines whether or not the \"alter ego\" doctrine will be applied in a case? (The judge or the jury?)",
    "question": "Who is it that determines whether or not the \"alter ego\" doctrine will be applied in a case? Is it the judge or the jury? (Or both?) And when is the doctrine applied? Right from the start of the case? Or is it the kind of thing you \"move\" the court to apply after some \"discovery\" is undertaken or at some point in the trial or even on trial?",
    "answers": [
        "The judge can make this determination in motions. If you make it to trial, the trier of fact (judge or jury), will make the call.",
        "The \"trier of fact\" makes this determination. Thus, if this is a jury trial, the jury will evaluate the evidence, whereas if this is a bench trial, the judge will decide.\n\nAlso, the judge MAY decide alter ego on a motion for summary judgment prior to trial.\n\nFurthermore, if the complaint lacks facts sufficient for an alter ego theory, it is also possible that the judge will sustain a demurrer very early on in the litigation.",
        "Assuming your question refers to \"piercing the corporate veil\" and holding an owner liable for the debts of a corporation, that is primarily a question of fact. The judge should articulate the legal standards to the jury and allow them to determine whether or not the corporation was the alter ego of the owner.\n\nA common exception to this would be a motion for summary judgment, wherein a party asks the court to rule a certain way based on the theory that no rational juror could find otherwise based on the evidence presented."

    "title": "Does a Claim of Exemption (Wage Garnishment) expire or need to be renewed in CA?",
    "question": "I'm in California (Los Angeles) & had a judgment entered against me in 2010. In order to prevent a subsequent wage garnishment, I filed a Claim of Exemption & a Beverly Hills Court granted my Claim of Exemption in August 2010. From that point, I had not heard anything more from the Judgment Creditor nor their attorneys until last week when I received a letter from said attorneys stating I must get in touch w/them so we can set up payment arrangements & that since they already have a judgment against me, if they don't hear from me they can garnish my wages, levy my bank account, etc. My situation hasn't changed from the time I filed the Claim of Exemption so can they still do this? For how long does the Claim of Exemption stay in effect? Do I need to re-file it? What recourse do I have?",
    "answers": [
        "THE CLAIM OF EXEMPTION WILL STAY IN EFFECT ON THIS CASE. IF OTHER CREDITORS TRY TO GARNISH YOUR WAGES YOU WILL NEED TO FILE A SEPARATE CLAIM OF EXEMPTION.",
        "There isn't an expiration date. You don't need to renew as to this particular judgment creditor."

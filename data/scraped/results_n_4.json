    "title": "Does the statute of limitations on debt restart to zero if the current collection agency sells the debt to another?",
    "question": "I understand that a debt collector cannot sue you for a debt after the statue of limitations runs. But if the current debt collector sells your debt another collection agency, does the statute of limitations clock restart for the new debt collector?",
    "answers": [
        "No. Sale of debt by collector does not re-start SOL for collection.",
        "I agree with my colleagues. Be mindful that the running of the statute of limitations starts with the last transaction - which includes consideration of not just a charge on an account but also the last payment made. Thus often collectors will urge you to make a small payment - which just extends the statute of limitations.",
        "No. The statute of limitations is calculated from the date of the last transaction.",
        "No - the sale of a debt from one business to another one does not re-start the statute of limitations. The new owner has to be given information about the date of the default and the date of the last payment, so it does not (illegally) sue the consumer for a time-barred debt.\n\nHowever keep in mind that a consumer can re-start the statute of limitations by making a partial payment on the account. For example, a consumer might \"acknowledge\" owing the debt and make a promise to pay it. However if the SOL has already run, the acknowledgment must be made in writing."

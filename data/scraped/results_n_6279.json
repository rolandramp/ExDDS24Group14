        "A Status Conference is to update the judge as to where you stand in the discovery process and how far you are both away from being able to go to trial. Nothing is decided at a Status Conference, it is for the information of the judge. Make sure you file any necessary Status Conference Statement necessary in your county. Calling the court clerk may give you some information of what the judge expects, other than your presence.",
        "A status conference is a court-ordered meeting with the judge where the judge will ask about the state of discovery and other issues to determine if the case is ready for trial.",
        "A status conference is just that, the Judge wants to know what the status is. This means, if you have no agreement, are you ready for trial? Being ready for trial means all the Financial Declarations have been filed and served, and that Conciliation Court for the children has been attended.\n\nIt is not to finanlize your divorce. However, if you do have an agreement, you can make your agreement into a Final Judgment. You do not have to agree on everything. If you agree on something, get it into Judgment form with FL 180 and FL 190, and the Judge can enter it at the Status Conference, provided you and the ex have complied with the declarations of disclosure. If all is not agreed to at the Status Conference, and if you have filed all required documents, your matter will be set for trial. If not ready, you will be ordered back for another Status Conference.\n\nPlease note that this answer does not constitute legal advice, and should not be relied on, as each situation is fact specific, and it is not possible to evaluate a legal problem without a comprehensive consultation and review of all the facts and court pleadings filed in the case. This answer does not create an attorney-client relationship"

        "I am assuming you don't have the money to get an attorney. If that is the case, Public Counsel has a great program for people who can't afford their own attorneys. They have a 4 hour class that teaches yo how to file every other Tuesday in their offices in Korea Town; there is a subway nearby and a bus stop and everything (this is called the bankruptcy pro se clinic)\n\nThey also have a bankruptcy self help desk every monday and wednesday, 10 am to 12 and 2 to 4 pm right inside the federal courthouse building (across the way from the bankruptcy courthouses).\n\nAttorneys volunteer there and I'm sure they will check your exemptions etc out for you for free. I've included a link for more info.",
        "Yes, disclose it. But take advantage of the pro bono legal help, free legal help that these other attorneys have referred you to. There may be something else that you are missing, and it could really make your filing turn into a nightmare.",
        "Yes, but not an issue. However, I would suggest speaking with an Attorney prior to filing. If you cannot afford an Attorney contact your local Bankruptcy court.\n\nAll the Bankruptcy courts in the Los Angeles area have a free legal aid clinic. I know, I volunteer at the one in the San Fernando Valley.\n\n\n\nJonathan Leventhal, Esq..\nLeventhal Law Group, P.C.\n818-347-5800\n\nNO EX-PARTE NOTICE VIA VOICE MAIL OR EMAIL: I do not accept e-mail notice for ex parte Applications via voicemail or by email.

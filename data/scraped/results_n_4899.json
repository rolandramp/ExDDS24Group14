    "title": "Can a Default Fraud Judgment be Discharged in Bankruptcy?",
    "question": "I have a credit card default judgment for fraud. I don't really understand how fraud was involved. I've let it go for several years. I see the collection account on my credit report but can't find any record of it anywhere else. Will a bankruptcy court re-examine the case if I file or will I have this hanging over me until I pay.",

        "As you can see by the varied answers, this is a sticky issue. But in my opinion, Stuart gave you the best answer. Assuming the judgement was entered by default, you have an argument in bankruptcy court that because the underlying case was not heard on its merits, that the judgment is discharged.\n\nWhat you should do about it; whether you should be proactive or reactive, entirely depends on the circumstances. Of course, the initial question, did you actually commit fraud (don't answer here). For example, if the debt is only a few thousand dollars, maybe play defense and see if the creditor does anything. Worse case scenario, you may need to reopen the BK down the road and request a discharge determination or simply settle with the creditor. If the debt is significant and the creditor has been aggressively pursuing the debtor, then as the debtor, you should probably file the Adversary Proceeding (determination of discharge) to bring finality to the situation. But, the BK court will try the case on the merits; so you go back to the first question, was fraud committed.\n\nAs a practical matter, depending on the amount and risk, you bankruptcy is (should) run you a pretty penny.",

        "The entry of judgment in a state court which judgment is based on fraud is not automatically accepted as a non-dischargeable debt. The creditor will have to prove the fraud to the BK judge. Since the state court judgment was by default, the fraud element was never heard on its merits, but rather included because the creditor convinced the judge with his one-sided statement. Be sure you fully disclose the details of this fraud judgment to your attorney before you file so he/she will not be surprised at the \"last minute\". Be prepared to pay a little extra if and when the creditor brings an adversary complaint against you for the fraud because most routine cases do not include extra work. Also, the creditor must file its complaint to determine the dischargability of its debt within the \"bar date\" or the court will not consider a late filed complaint absent some compelling reason by the creditor, such as lack of notice or the notice sent to the wrong address for the creditor.

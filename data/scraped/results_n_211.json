    "question": "My father has a revocable trust. I am trustee and my sister and I are down as 50/50. We each have 3 children listed in the trust as contingent beneficiaries. My father lives elsewhere and has an old house that is currently vacant and in disrepair. My father wants to let this grandson repair the house on my father's dime to make it livable so he (the grandson) can move in to rent it from my father. My father wants to let the grandson rent the house for 50% lower than fair market value compared to other similar rentals in this area. Fair market rent is $3200/mo. The grandson (a contingent beneficiary) who wants to move in is my sisters son.",

        "Very simply, this is your father's trust and your father's property and he can do whatever he wants with it, including renting out the house to his grandson for less than fair market rent. He can even amend the trust to eliminate you as a successor trustee and/or beneficiary. Once your father passes on and you are the trustee of the trust, feel free to raise the rent on your grandson to fair market value until such time as the trust distributes the trust assets to you and your sister. But be prepared to never speak to your sister or nephew again. Personally and without knowing more about the family dynamics, I think what your father is doing is pretty nice by turning a non performing asset into a performing asset and giving his grandson a place to live at reduced rent in return for fixing the place up."

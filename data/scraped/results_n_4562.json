    "title": "Do I qualify for a summary dissolution if I own a condo?",
    "question": "Do I qualify for a summary dissolution if I own a condo valued around $180,000 that I purchased before we were married? My husband and I have a prenuptial agreement stating that the house would remain mine in the case of a divorce and we still agree on the terms. We have been married for less than 5 years, no kids, no major debts before or after marriage and we are not wanting spousal support. I am just unsure if owning a condo that we live in disqualifies us. Thanks in advance.",
    "answers": [
        "Unfortunately, if either or both of the parties own any real property, they cannot use the Summary Dissolution procedure - you will need to file a regular Dissolution of Marriage Action.",
        "Family law does not do summary judgments. You can request a bifurcated trial on the issue if that will move the divorce along and resolve the most contentious issue in the divorce.",
        "To qualify for a summary dissolution of your marriage you must meet ALL of the following requirements.\n\nYou and your spouse:\n\nHave been married for less than 5 years (from the date you got married to the date you separated);\n\nDo not own any part of land or buildings; Oh Oh I think this means No to your question"

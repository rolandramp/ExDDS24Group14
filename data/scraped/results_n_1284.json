    "title": "If a spouse puts a bilateral hold on a joint LOC, is a bank and/or the freezing spouse required to inform the other?",
    "question": "My friend and her husband are likely headed towards divorce. He's a SAHH and she is a high-earner who works like crazy. My friend tried to get access to a joint LOC to make a substantial withdrawal (to pay back creditors for which she and her soon-to-be-ex-husband are responsible to), but found out that it had been frozen by her husband when she tried to withdraw. She did not receive notification from her husband or the bank that it was frozen several months prior.",
    "answers": [
        "Here is what I would advise your friend. First, documentation is power in any divorce - contested or otherwise. A paper trail of the community property dealings, ie, assets, liabilities, financials for all financial institutions, corporate records, bank accounts is generally mandatory. Photographs of all valuable or condition of vehicles, or things as \"sports memorabilia\" is a must to support existence, content and condition.\nThe sooner a petition for dissolution came be file, then, an ex-parte petition concerning the marital business and having the husband return money subject to the LOC can be dealt with. Definitely have her prepare for a battle, and see local family law attorney ASAP.",
        "Taking money out of a line of credit to pay off other joint debts may not be the best thing for either of them to do. With a divorce looming, neither spouse is supposed to take action that will harm the community. On a joint account, a bank can take action on instruction by one of the people on the account. To undo it, the bank would probably require the approval of all account holders. The bank would not have to provide special notice to each of the account holders, generally.\nThe husband was probably right to stop this since he will be equally responsible for any of the debt.",
        "unlikely that any notices are required... if a joint account, and bank believes there is fraud involved, they will simply freeze it. A family law attorney should get involved. I'm reposting to family law so hopefully you will get more answers."

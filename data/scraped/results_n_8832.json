    "title": "How do get paid from my client on past-due invoices?",
    "question": "I run a small business, and one of my largest clients has not paid in 4 months. It is a very large amount for me. Contract says payments terms are Net 30, but so far I let them slide up to 90 days out of good will, and they have been more or less regularly paying after 90 days. But now, the guy is saying that he ran out of cash, and that he cannot pay any more. What can I do at this point? What are the legal consequences for him for not satisfying contractual obligations on payments, and how do I pursue that?",

        "Either they are not paying you, because they have other priorities, or they are not paying you and not paying a whole lot of other vendors. A lawsuit may get you some funds, say from their checking account, using a bank levy, but it may also push them to fight you and drag through the court all sorts of things which they disagree with you, even if it is merely 20/20 hindsight. No vendor provides the perfect service, for which there is no complaint. There is always someone that can testify how your services were unprofessional and not as agreed.\n\nI think you may get some good mileage by taking the manager or CEO or CFO out to lunch or making a business appointment and discussing what you have done for them, but that you are concerned about the lack of payment, and they need to start \"chipping away\" at the outstanding balance. See if you can get commitment and a check that day. Don't discuss lawsuits, whatever you do. Keep the meeting cordial and supportive, as I think you are more likely to get them to pay you, because they want to pay you and see the value of a continued relationship with you, rather than one that has become litigious. They may have plenty of other vendors threatening or filing suit.\n\nAs you can see, in your case, I feel that a non-litigation approach is the way to start a dialog, as a lawsuit will sever the relationship and perhaps disrupt your own small business and services. You may also find that litigation pushes the company to file bankruptcy, in which case you stand to lose all of the receivables.",
        "I agree with my colleagues. This is a complex collections matter which can become quite contentious. You should first review your contracts, if any. If the owner of the company or, any of its principals, personally guaranteed the contracts, you should send the invoices to them for immediate payment.\n\nIf the client continues to refuse to pay, and depending on the size of the account, you should hire an attorney to pursue a legal judgment against the company or the owner/prinicpal, if the debt was personally guaranteed. If you obtain a judgment, you may be able to lien property owned by the company or the owner/principal.\n\nOf course, your remedies will depend on the type of contract you have, who guaranteed the contract and the assets of the debtor.\n\nDisclaimer: The above content is meant for general information purposes only and should not be considered specific legal advice. Every case varies and legal advice will also vary depending on the facts of each case. The requestor is encouraged to contact a qualified attorney in their area to discuss more thoroughly their specific case.",
        "This is a complex commercial collection issue. You must start with looking at who is responsible for the debt. Did you get a guaranty from any principals? If so, you should send a default letter to the principal. It sounds like you have been in contact with the debtor recently, and have run out of negotiation options. Of course, you should not ship any more merchandise to this debtor unless you are paid at least a portion of your overdue amount. Perhaps the debtor can return a portion of what he bought from you for credit, so that you can resell it.\nYou may need to sue the debtor to enforce collection. There are lawyers across the country that specialize in commercial collection, and usually work on a contingency fee. The older the receivable, the less likely it is to be collectible. Don't delay! Hire a professional collection attorney soon.",
        "You should file a suit right away or ask the vendor if they are willing to sign a confession of judgment. Sounds like a future bankruptcy."

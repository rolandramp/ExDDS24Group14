    "title": "How do I list my Student Loan in my Chapter 13 plan to pay off first before my unsecured creditors?",
    "question": "I am filing Chapter 13 Pro Se. I want to pay off my Student loan first before my unsecured creditors. How do I list this in my chapter 13 payment plan? Does it go under unsecured debt? If so, I do I segment it out to get higher priority? Do I list it as a priority, unsecured? I know people have paid their student loans directly during this period. How do I set that up? Since it is the only thing in my plan that is not dischargeable, I would like to pay it first. Also, it will be a cure and maintain account as the amount is $41,000.00",

        "Yes. Based on facts cited, you have several remedies under federal and state collection laws as well as civil harassment laws.\nFine line between harassment, stalking and intimidation and reasonable surveillance. Must be decided in context of all facts and activities.\nConsult debt collection defense counsel.",
        "Consult with a consumer attorney about the details and context, which is important, to determine whether this repo agent is liable under any law or under the Common Law of California. These are tricky cases, but a recovery is possible and if a consumer protection statute applies, perhaps you can also recover your legal fees in court, but do not delay as there are time limits involved. Read my legal guide, below, on the rights of the consumer following repossession, which you need to know, so that you are not stuck with a large bill and a horrible entry on your credit reports. Protect yourself, even if you no longer wanted to keep this vehicle.",
        "Use of obscenity by an agent repossesing a car is a violation of the Rosenthal Act . You may have remedies.",
        "You could return whatever the repo man wants, if he is entitled to it.",
        "So you have failed to pay your debts, looks like you tried to hide yourself and the car (you call it stalking, I call it surveillance) and you are worried about what a repo man yelled at you and your seven year old? I understand that people fall on hard times. But accepting responsibility and teaching your child how to accept responsibility would go a long way. If you had faced the responsibility with dignity, you would have not given the obnoxious repo man the excuse to act the way he did. Was there intentional infliction of emotional distress based on his outrageous conduct? Maybe... I wonder what your damages are if any ...and what the cost would be to run a case like this... Talk to a local PI type attorney to assess if you have a case beyond what we have seen here. But don't be surprised to be told that rude and obscene language does not amount to much if a case.",

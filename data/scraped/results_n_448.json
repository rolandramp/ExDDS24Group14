    "title": "Can a minimized copy of a response to a complaint be considered served properly in bankruptcy court?",
    "question": "If the opposing counsel sent a response to a complaint minimizing 2 pages into 1 page in a bankruptcy case, can this still be considered a true and correct copy? Are there grounds to vacate a response if it is served this way?",

        "Frankly, I assume (or hope) your question is not asked in seriousness. As much as copiers can reduce to a smaller size, or duplex to utilize both sides of the paper, they can also be used to enlarge. If your does not have this capacity, a modestly priced magnifying glass would serve equally well. But bringing a motion to strike a responsive pleading based upon utilizing cost-saving reductions of 50% would be appropriately the basis for the imposition of sanctions under Rule 9011.",
        "I changed the area of law to bankruptcy. I have seen the reduced copies before, but I am not aware of rule authorizing it. Sometimes it makes the text barely legible.",
        "I agree with the comments given by my colleagues. You can easily enlarge the print on your photo copy machine."

    "title": "What kind of lawyer do I need to fight a writ of execution?",
    "question": "I received a judgement of a writ of execution that was originally filed in 1983. This is the first I've ever heard of it. It was for a motorcycle that was repossessed. They want $41,000 for a bike that was only $9,000; the rest is interest since 1983. Since the bike was repossessed, I shouldn't owe them anything. I want to fight this without having to claim bankruptcy. What kind of attorney do I need?",
    "answers": [
        "You need an attorney who handles debt collection defense, more broadly known as a consumer attorney involved in debtor's rights. Please see my legal guide, linked below, on consumer rights following repossession, which explains what should have taken place after the vehicle was repossessed. Also, Due Process requires delivery of the Summons and Complaint to you personally (known as personal service) or substitute service on an adult at your residence or a supervising person at your workplace. You may have the right to set aside this very old judgment, but you must proceed promptly, or you may waive defects for not filing the proper court papers shortly after learning of this judgment. This is known as setting aside a default judgment.\n\nRobert Stempler (please see DISCLAIMER below)\nwww.StopCollectionLawsuits.com\nwww.facebook.com/SoCalConsumerLawyer\nTwitter: @RStempler",
        "I think most attorneys, including BK attorneys, could investigate your claim and discover your options. You state you received a \"judgment of a writ of execution.\" However, a judgment is different from a writ of execution. An attorney would want to review the court file to determine if a writ indeed issued and if the judgment was timely renewed. You should expect to pay for the services to determine if you have any defenses. Alternatively, as you suggest, a BK would probably resolve the issue as would a compromise with the debtor. Good luck.",
        "Civil attorney but if this was from a 1983 judgment there is likely nothing that can be done to the judgment if it was properly renewed.",
        "An attorney who is experienced in civil litigation, commercial litigation or in consumer law. There are attorneys listed in the \"Find a Lawyer\" tab on the website of the National Assn of Consumer Advocates. You probably do not need to file BK at this time.\n\nYour attorney will need to review all of the court papers ever filed in the case. Then, make a motion to set aside the default judgment. You might have a good shot at winning because such a long period of time has passed. The debt is probably in the possession of a \"junk debt buyer\" who does not have access to the original documents and who purchased the claim for a penny or two on the dollar."

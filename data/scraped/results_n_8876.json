        "The consular portion of the Fiance Visa is the most difficult. I suggest you consult a lawyer.\nThe K-1 Fiancé/Fiancee Visa\nImportant K-1 Factors:\n\n1.\nThe K-1 Visa allows you to invite your fiancée to America\nfor a period of 90 days, during which time your fiancee must\neither marry you or return to her home country.\nThere are no exceptions to this rule\n2.\nNo extensions of the time period are permitted.\nThere are no exceptions to this rule\n3.\nYou and your fiancee are not required to marry if things\ndon’t work out according to your expectations.\nThere are no exceptions to this rule.\n4.\nIf you do not marry your fiancee, you will not be precluded\nfrom making a future Fiancee Visa application (although a\nsecond fiancee petition will be more challenging) and your\nfiancee will not be precluded from receiving another visa\nin the future.\n\nVisa Status:\nA Fiancee Visa is a temporary nonimmigrant visa, but one that can be readily converted to permanence(Green Card) after the marriage occurs in the U.S..\n_________________________________________\nCriteria for K-1 Visa Approval:\nIn order to qualify for a Fiancee Visa, you must meet\nthe following main requirements:\n\n1. You are a U.S. citizen (there is no comparable visa for\npermanent residents);\n\n2. You and your fiancee are both legally free to marry;\n\n3. You and your fiancee both have a serious intention to marry\nwithin 90 days of your fiancee’s arrival in the United States of America;\n\n4. You have been physically with your fiancé within the previous two years.\n\nExceptions:\n\nThere is a provision in the law that may exempt the petitioner from the meeting requirement \"if it is established that compliance would result in extreme hardship to the petitioner or that compliance would violate strict and long-established customs of the K-1 beneficiary's foreign culture or social practice, as where marriages are traditionally arranged by the parents of the contracting parties and the prospective bride and groom are prohibited from meeting subsequent to the arrangement and prior to the wedding day.\" (INA § 214.2(k)(2)).\n\nUnfortunately, such waivers are very rarely granted by the USCIS. The \"extreme hardship\" exception has been interpreted by the USCIS to mean something very close to \"impossible\". It generally is available only to people who are so disabled that they can't fly at all. As for the second grounds for a waiver, very few people qualify for this exception, and those that do often have a difficult time proving it to the government's satisfaction.\n\nThe fiancé visa process is in three phases:\n\n1. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) Phase:\n\nThe petitioner must first submit a properly completed application to the USCIS. The petitioner and fiancee will need to file numerous other documents with the USCIS in order to prove that the petitioner and fiancee qualify for the K-1 Fiancee Visa.\n\nUSCIS Processing Times:\n\nThe waiting time for the USCIS to approve a K1 visa can be anywhere from thirty days to seven or eight months, depending on the backlog of similar cases pending approval in the USCIS Service Center. The case can be further delayed by an error in the petition, or by not submitting the required documentation, which typically doubles the normal waiting time for visa approval.\n\nAn error in the petition will cause the USCIS to send the petitioner a Request For Additional Evidence (\"RFE\"). The USCIS send out literally thousands of RFEs per year. Of course, every petitioner who filed the incorrect petitions had read the USCIS instructions and thought he had done everything",

    "title": "Is failure to comply with discovery requests also a breach of fiduciary duty?",
    "question": "In my divorce case I also served my husband with form interrogatories (family law) and a request for production of documents. He never responded, even after I reminded him. Technically, did he breach the fiduciary duty in Family Code § 1100(e) “...to provide equal access to all information, records, and books that pertain to the value and character of those assets and debts, upon request.” Also Family Code § 721(b)(1) and (2). Therefore, in a divorce, does failure to comply with discovery requests for the above cited information and records also count as a violation of fiduciary duty?",

        "California law makes it clear that each spouse has a fiduciary duty to each other to disclose all the facts and details which go into the disclosures of assets, liabilities and everything else attendant upon a marriage and divorce. But rather than be all \"technical\" I join counsel in recommending you file a motion to compel and specify exactly what kinds of documents you want. The fiduciary argument would be appropriate if the fight becomes more extensive and complicated. You should consult with an attorney for advice on the details of how to do all of this.",
        "Failure to respond to discovery on its own is probably not a breach of fiduciary duty.",
        "I would skip this \"technical\" argument. File your motion to compel based on standard grounds. BTW, if you actually served them yourself -- the service was improper. Good luck."

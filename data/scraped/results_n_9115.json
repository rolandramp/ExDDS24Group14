        "Unfortunately, most small business people get an LLC thinking that they can protect themselves from personal liability, only to be required to sign leases and other contracts for the LLC with the owners being personally responsible, as well.\n\nHave an experienced business lawyer review your lease agreement and the documents used to wind up your LLC. If you contact your local bar association, they should have a referral program, which normally gets you a consultation for a flat fee, such as $50. At least you will get a personal consultation and can make an informed decision on whether to settle with the landlord, before a lawsuit is filed.",
        "People can always be sued, but whether a suit can be successful or not depends on the facts. If the individual LLC members personally guaranteed the lease, as is usually required for LLC tenants, yes, the landlord will be able to hold the indviduals personally liable.\n\nIt might also be the case that if the LLc didn't observe the few formalities that LLCs have, so that the LLC's corporate veil can be pierced, the individual members can be held personally responsible for the LLC's debts.\n\nSee a lawyer to have your lease and LLC documents reviewed.\n\nDisclaimer: Please note that this answer does not constitute legal advice, and should not be relied on, since each state has different laws, each situation is fact specific, and it is impossible to evaluate a legal problem without a comprehensive consultation and review of all the facts and documents at issue. This answer does not create an attorney-client relationship."

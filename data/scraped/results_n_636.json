    "question": "It doesn't amount to a huge number and I should be able to exempt what I have left using wildcard but I am just wondering if it is possible for either of these events to inflate my income numbers for means test purposes. I pass but not if that money were somehow treated as regular income.",

        "Generally income is intended to be a consistent, regular receipt of money. Selling something is not the same as salary unless your business consists of selling your home more than once. In other words, selling your home is a one time event. Make sure your attorney explains this anomaly in the notes section of Schedule I.",
        "Although the reason for the a payment for loss of earnings or for disability, and is instead a casualty loss, i.e., compensation for damage to property, it most likely would not constitute income.\n\nThe same is true with regard to sale of your home, cents liquidation of an asset to cash does not result in income, since the cash likely will be used either to purchase a replacement home or but two other purposes. The mere fact that proceeds from the sale of an asset might be used to supplement your income does not to convert the monies to income.\n\nIn any event, as Robert Firth correctly points out, even if all of the funds were treated as income, it is a one time event and since it is non-recurring, the Means Test Form includes the option of explaining the non-recurring nature of the monies received, which would serve to rebut the presumption that proceeding as a Chapter 7 case constitutes an abuse.\n\nYou should be mindful if the proceeds result from the sale of your home, and assuming you recorded a homestead declaration prior to the sale, the protection of those proceeds as I homestead requires that you reinvest the funds within six months of receipt, or the homestead protection will be lost.",
        "Since this is a one off event, it shouldn't affect the means test. Just have your attorney explain it in the notes section on Schedule I. Reference the Lanning case."

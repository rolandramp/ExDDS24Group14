    "title": "How can an SBA collector come after me aggressively when the only income/asset I reported/had was from the business that failed?",
    "question": "Hi, I was a 50% owner of a business, for 10 years with a partner back in 2017. At one point in Sept of 2017, my BP decided she no longer wanted to be in business and signed off. Well, at that point I choose to continue with business: however, I didn't realize my BP had taken a huge amount of money from the business account which would've caused the business to crumble within a mo. or two. So i was recommended to take out a small business loan, & I did in Dec of 2017. At the time I wasn't aware the business vendorization was only valid if neither of us resigned & when she signed off the business & submitted a letter of resignation, the agency contract was void & the business closed. I had already pulled the loan & used the money to buy inventory. When I applied for the loan I was very clear, the only asset & income I had/received was from the business, I'm applying for the loan on. Since the SBA defaulted, the collection agency tells me I have to pay the full $9000 by April 1, 2019, or make an agreement to pay $1000 for nine mos. I am on SSDI now I don't even get $1000 per mo, now they're suing me to levy my accts/garnishing me & reporting bad on my credit report. HELP ME! Plz",

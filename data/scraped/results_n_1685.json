    "title": "I attended my 341 meeting last week and the Trustee gave us a date of October 5 for discharge.",
    "question": "I completed all the paperwork on my own which was extremely stressful and I would never do again but luckily all went well and my case was rather straight forward. I have an overpayment with the EDD and included in in my list of creditors. Is is common for these over-payments to be discharged? Does the EDD normally file a claim against the discharge? I was receiving the money and honestly not knowing I shouldn't have. Also, how do I surrender my car? They sent me a reaffirmation offer which I don't want to accept. Thank you for any answers.",

        "I agree with my colleagues who have answered thus far. As to the Reaffirmation Agreement, do not sign it if your desire is to surrender the vehicle and discharge the balance owing on the vehicle. Also, when contacting the creditor to make arrangements to surrender the vehicle make sure a person with authority for the creditor takes possession of the vehicle and keys and signs-off with a receipt. I recommend that the receipt, in addition to being signed by the creditor include the date, time, make, model and VIN. Having it dated with a time will protect you should the creditor or his agent get into an accident post-surrender.",
        "Don't sign the reaffirmation agreement. Contact the creditor and make arrangements to surrender the vehicle, to avoid them towing it from your house after the Discharge. Hopefully the EDD won't fight you on it if they believe it was an honest mistake.",
        "As long as you were truthful in your EDD application and the overpayment was due to clerical error you are most likely not going to see any action to declare the debt non-dischargable. However, if there was actionable fraud or misrepresentation on your part in the EDD process that resulted in the overpayment it is possible that EDD can take action against you in the form of an adversary proceeding to declare the debt non-dischargeable. Keep in mind that it does take work and money to file a claim and EDD is likely not going to do so unless it has clear evidence of fraud or misrepresentation. Like the others have stated, generally EDD does not object to discharge of overpayments.\n\nHowever, be aware that should you ever need EDD payments in the future, the discharge of the overpayment in bankruptcy does not take away EDD's ability to recoup the overpayment from future EDD payments. You should consult a lawyer in the future should you ever need EDD payments again.\n\nTo surrender your car, contact the lender. They will inform you of their procedures to surrender the car. It is best to document the surrender in case any dispute were to arise in the future.",
        "I agree with James and Stuart. I would add that the date the trustee mentioned, October 5th, is probably the final date that creditors or the U S Trustee can file an Adversary Proceeding objecting to the creditor's debt being discharged or objecting to you being entitled to a discharge of all of your debt. Generally, in most jurisdictions, the discharge will not be entered on the very first day that the discharge can be granted. That usually happens about 2 to 4 weeks after the deadline to object has passed.",
        "I concur with my colleague atty Shields. Absent any fraud on your part, the EDD overpayment can be discharged.",
        "Yes. Simple EDD overpayment not involving fraud or misrepresentation is dischargeable in BK.\nNo. In absence of fraud or misrepresentation, EDD normally does not object to discharge.\nWork directly with creditor to arrange surrender of vehicle. Surrender procedures vary with each creditor."

        "I must respectfully disagree with Mr. Shields. While 30 days time may or may not be a reasonable amount of time for the attorney to act, some response to your repeated contacts should occur much sooner than that. Further, California Business and Professions Code section 6148 generally requires written attorney-client fee agreements for all matters where the fee will likely be more than $1,000. Since the attorney asked for $2,000 from you, that section likely applies to your situation.\nAre you certain that the person you are dealing with is actually an attorney? You can look up California attorneys on-line on the State Bar website: http://members.calbar.ca.gov/fal/LicenseeSearch/QuickSearch?ResultType=0&SearchType=0&SoundsLike=False",
        "I would start with a letter to the lawyer pointing out that that the California Business and Professions Code Sec. 6148 requires that the lawyer provide you with a written retainer agreement when the fee is this large and request your money back. If no reply in thirty days, file a complaint with the Bar or a suit in small claims court (but that will entail a filing fee).",
        "Several things to keep in mind:\n-30 elapsed days is not an unreasonable amount of time;\n-review retainer for refund policy;\n-contacting CA state bar is premature at this time\nContact your attorney to discuss how to move forward."

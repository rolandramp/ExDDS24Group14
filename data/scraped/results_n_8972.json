    "title": "Options when bank sues on personal guarantee?",
    "question": "I own an LLC (with one other partner)with commercial real estate which is now worth less than Note & the rental income down so that I can't quite make interest payment. We have personal guarantees on the Note. Difference between value of property and Note is about $600,000. What are my options to protect my personal assets? I believe occupancy will go back up in about 18-24 months, but commercial mortgage loan expires in 6 months and we won't be able to refinance. Also purchased property with 1031 exchange. Advice welcome.",

        "If you have assets over a million dollars, you should contact an asset protection lawyer. Asset protection can be accomplished but it is very expensive and most asset protection lawyers will tell you that because of the cost, only quite wealthy individuals, for the most part consider it.

Domestic asset protection is often accomplished with the use of a family limited partnership while offshore asset protection is often accomplished with a foreign trust and/or LLC.

Bankruptcy may be a viable option but it depends on what you own and the exemptions in your State.\n\nWhen you file Bankruptcy you create a financial estate.

It does not matter if a person files a Chapter 7 or a Chapter 13 Bankruptcy. These exemptions apply to all cases:\nHomestead exemption: This is where the homeowner who is on the Deed and living in the property gets to protect $50,000.00 (in New York…other States Vary!!!)each (up to two) of equity in the property. So, if one person is on the Deed and they live in the house and the home is worth $50,000.00 and is paid off, they get to keep the home and no one can try and take it if they file Bankruptcy. If two people are on the Deed and reside in the home the house can be paid off and worth $100,000.00 and nothing will happen to it if they file a Bankruptcy.\nPersonal property: The vast majority of people do not have to worry about losing property when they file Bankruptcy. However, it is your obligation to report all property. Most people’s furniture, bedroom sets, dining room sets, clothes, etc. are normal consumer items that we list, but since the PERSONAL PROPERTY EXEMPTION IN NEW YORK IS $10,000.00 DOLLARS (In New York…check your State) we have found that it is not worth the trouble by the Trustee appointed to oversee your Bankruptcy to take and sell the property.\nDON’T:\nTake out a second mortgage to pay credit cards;\nTransfer property to family members or friends to “protect it”;\nTake money out of your retirement account to pay credit cards.\nDisclaimer: This answer does not constitute legal advice.

    "question": "I defaulted on a credit card for $4800. I was served a summons on 5-15-2011 with court on the date 10-20-2011. I received a notice on 7-15-2011 that a judgement had been entered. I did not realize I had to \"answer\" the summons. Today I received a NOTICE OF INVOLUNTARY LIEN with a copy of an ABSTRACT OF JUDGEMENT issued on 11-15-2011.",

        "No. The lien does not directly give the creditor rights to your bank accounts. An Abstract of Judgment is a notice which is recorded in the County Recorder's office which places a lien on any real property you now own or may own in the future. It is not directly usable to levy on bank accounts. A Writ of Execution is used to levy on bank accounts.\n\nThat being said, once a judgment has been entered, there are various methods to enforce the judgment, such as levying bank accounts and garnishing wages.\n\nTherefore, you may wish to consult with an attorney on getting the default set aside and the default judgment vacated, or alternatively, to work on a payment plan or other type of settlement which has less surprises for you.",
        "It is the Jdgment that gives the Jdgment Creditor a right to levy or garnishment.\n\nThe notice is procedural.",
        "You may wish to consult with a debt collections attorney to determine you can try to have the default and default judgment set aside so you can litigate the matter on the merits.\n\nA recorded abstract of judgment places a lien on any REAL property you now own, or may in the future own, in the county in which the abstract was recorded. The lien is valid until the judgment expires, which is 10 years from date of entry. The judgment can be renewed anytime before the expiration, and a new abstract of judgment recorded.\n\nA bank levy is instituted when the plaintiff/judgment creditor sends instructions and the writ of execution and a $30-35 fee to the \"levying officer\" (usually the county sheriff). The sheriff then serves the levy upon your bank. You will not receive notice until the funds have been levied (taken from your bank account). You have a certain number of days (I think 10 days) from the date you receive notice of levy to file an exemption with the levying officer, who will hold the funds at its office for a certain number of days. The levying officer will then notify the plaintiff, who may or may not oppose the exemption and set a court hearing. If the plaintiff does not oppose the exemption within a certain number of days, then the levying officer will automatically return the monies to your bank.\n\nThe plaintiff also can levy other non-exempt personal property, including your wages. Your employer will give you notice and you can act similarly to the procedures for the exemption for bank levy.",
        "yes. they have obtained a judgment. the abstract of judgment means that they are hunting for your assets. before you know it, they will be at your bank sweeping out all the money. you do NOT receive advance warning of this. Perhaps you can speak with a local attorney for free or very low cost for techniques, strategies and options. Even with a judgment, the creditor is likely to settle with you. Their goal is money, not crushing defeat. Do not delay."

    "title": "Can you be sued for a debit that is over the statue of limitation ?",
    "question": "I received a call from a company by the name of ACA Mediation , telling me that a civil suit has been filed from a debit going back to 2006. I filed BK in 2006 and my BK was discharge , under the FDCPA is this legal for a posing as a mediation company to call and harass people? The person I spoke with was very rude , would speak over you and not allow you to speak , also under FCC can I legally file a complaint against this company? Thank you for your time",

        "I agree with my colleagues. It is likely a scam. Ask them for a case number next time they call and try and get as much information from them as you can such as company, name of employee, etc. You might have some claims under FDCPA (Federal Debt Collection Practices Act).",
        "My suspicion is that you are being scammed. I'm a lawyer and I have received calls like this. I let the calls go to voice mail and when I call the number provided, invariably it is a non working number. To be safe, check the court records in the county in which you live. At the very least, the next time they call, ask for the court file number. I bet they can't provide it.",
        "They say they filed suit against you? I would say to them, \"Great. Come and serve me.\"\n\nI think they are lying.\n\nThere is a lot of criminal scamming and fraud taking place to intimidate people to pay debts they don't really owe, so be careful. Often it is just a coincidence that they randomly call someone who in fact has an old, unpaid debt, and they take advantage of you when you jump to the conclusion that they are collecting that particular debt - when actually they have made the whole thing up.\n\nWhat you can do is demand that they validate the debt, by showing you written proof that they are legally entitled to collect on it, and proof that you owe it, and tell them you will then take it to an attorney to check it out.\n\nI bet they won't ever send you anything, or say they are not required to prove anything to you.\nAnd DO NOT give them any personal info, or else they might use that info to steal your identity.\nThat would be a sure sign that they are crooks and that there is no such debt! After that, you probably won't ever hear from them again.\n\nThese fraudulent scams always seem to come up in a phone call, never a letter, because they are afraid to put their fraudulent representations in writing. And, they do not want to be traced to a physical address out of fear of being arrested.",
        "Many questions are being posted about calls from people who call themselves \"mediators\" but who are more likely scam-operators. Its not illegal to be rude, but it IS ILLEGAL to fail to provide correct identification when making a debt collection phone call, and to make false statements, such as the statement that they can ask you to pay a debt that was discharged in bankruptcy, or that a lawsuit has been filed, when it has not. (Check with the court in the county where you live to see if a case has been filed.)\n\nIf you can confirm the identity of the person who called you, the name of his/her employer, and the address of the caller's employer, you may be able to sue for damages. However, in my experience, these calls usually come from scam-operators who so not provide any identifying information and who cannot be located. For the same reason, filing a complaint with a government agency may have no impact on this illegal practice."

    "title": "My husband & I jointly own 2 homes, would divorce court give him one and me the other? He wants foreclosure on the one I live in",
    "question": "My husband and I have been living apart for a year, but was working toward reconciling. He just informed me he wants a divorce, for me to move to the house he lives in (a smaller, less expensive mortgage) and he wants to foreclose on the one I live in. This allows him to rid himself of both loans. I would assume 100% of the smaller house, he would force foreclosure on the larger house. I don't think this is fair, just because he wants out as fast. Foreclosure would devastate my credit. Would a judge allow him to foreclose out of desperation? He didn't lose his job..a quick fix for him to rid himself of financial responsibilities. Also our son would be torn from school/sports. I don't think I could afford the large mortgage alone. Would a judge give him one and me one? What is equal?",

        "This allows him to get rid of both loans AND YOU......this may be a great deal for him but that is not the general rule. The general rule is 50/50 but that does not necessarily mean one house for each of you, either. Generally, if everything is converted to cash and all debts paid, then divide the proceeds 50/50.\nOne of the primary considerations is custody and maintenance of the home for the benefit of the children.\nCommunity property says that everything acquired during the marriage is 50/50. Spousal support for a long term (10 yrs) marriage to maintain the standard of living the other spouse has become accustomed or to amount agreed. So if you are making 2 X his income, you could possibly have to pay alimony, child support, etc.....\nYou need to talk to a family law attorney so you can protect you, your son's future and defend your rights.",
        "In addition to what has already been stated, I would want to make sure that if either home has a 2nd mortgage taken out after the purchase of the home you will likely be on the hook for that loan even if the house is foreclosed... both of you even if the home is awarded to one of you in the divorce. See an attorney."

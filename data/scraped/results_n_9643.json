        "I disagree with your attorney and the answer posted above. I have handled hundreds and hundreds of cases in San Diego and not once have I advised a client to sign a reaffirmation agreement with respect to real estate. The only reason in your case to even entertain a reaffirmation agreement on your first is if they are offering to cancel the second trust deed (assuming it is with the same lender-post is kind of confusing where you say bank said you could put second into bankruptcy but need to reaffirm the first). I would NEVER recommend a client sign a reaffirmation agreement on real estate absent extraordinary circumstances such as described above. Once you sign the agreement and it is filed with the court (no court approval is necessary for reaffirmation of real estate), you are back on the hook for the debt and if you default in the future you can be sued. There is no downside if you simply continue to pay the mortgage as you have done in the past and not sign the agreement. If for some reason you default in the future, your lender can only take the property back and CANNOT sue you for any deficiency balance as they can if you do sign a reaffirmation agreement. Again, unless they are agreeing to cancel the second trust deed, significantly reduce interest or principal, or some other HUGE benefit to you, advising a client to sign a reaffirmation agreement on real estate is very ill-advised in my opinion.\n\nLEGAL DISCLAIMER\nMr. Larkin is licensed to practice law in CA and is located in San Diego.

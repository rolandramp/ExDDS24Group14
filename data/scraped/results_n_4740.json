    "title": "Statute of limitations for Debt Collection for the deceased.",
    "question": "Hello, I have read the statutes for debt collection on existing debts, e.g. ones that have a contract associated, or an oral agreement, etc. However, once a person is deceased, what is the statute of limitation for a company to file a new order for a collection of a debt?",
    "answers": [
        "talk to a local probate attorney.",
        "How are they going to personally serve the deceased with Summons and Complaint? They can file anything they want, but unless the deceased comes back to life, they do not have a good lawsuit.\n\nIf there was a probate administration or if assets were transferred without probate, and if you (not the deceased) is named as a defendant in the lawsuit, you should gather all of the relevant documents and consult a lawyer.",
        "Disclaimer: The materials provided below are informational and should not be relied upon as legal advice.\n\nI am not sure I understand your description correctly. Are you saying a new debt was incurred by the deceased around 18 months after the deceased's death? Obviously, a person who passes away can no longer make a purchase or incur a debt. So, for example, if there is a charge on the deceased's credit card after her death, some living individual is using the account and will be responsible for it. In California, the statute of limitation to sue on written agreements and verbal agreements are 4 years and 2 years, respectively. The same limitations would apply after the person's death, except the creditor will have to place a claim against the probate estate. Be sure to consult your own attorney to protect your legal rights."

    "question": "I generated debt while in Colorado and the judgement was found to be against me. Shortly thereafter I moved to Nevada and opened a new bank account in a local bank there. Before I moved I received a notice that my wages would be garnished but I moved again to California and no longer work at the job they were going to garnish my wages from. I still owe about $3600. Can my bank account be garnished now? How can they do that if the judgement was in Colorado but the bank is in Nevada?",

        "A judgment from one state can be domesticated in any other state. There are even international treaties that allow it to be enforced in other countries.\n\nBe sure that the company does not try to evade the laws that protect you from illegal collection attempts from non-domesticated judgments. I have seen debt collection agencies attempt to enforce an out-of-state judgment on someone living in another state, by taking advantage of the fact that the employer or the bank had offices in the state where the judgment was filed, but the employee/account holder lived in another state.

It may even be to your advantage to open your account in a state where you don't live and then do internet banking and bank by mail.

        "So you went to a paralegal who committed UPL. Bummer. You would be wise to file an amended petition. Even wiser... pay a lawyer to assist you.",
        "You need to go back to help you file and ask them about the form they helped you fill out.",
        "You got bad legal advice regarding the FL-100. It is best, now to amend the petition and response to reflect that you either have assets/ liabilities to divide or that the assets and liabilities, both community and of separate property character are not yet known at this time. Then, go and get legal assistance as I think you might be putting yourself into a bad place without a proper and fair distribution of both assets and liabilities in this marriage."

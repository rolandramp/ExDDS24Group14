    "title": "Can I hire an Attorney to remove myself from my daughters student loan, I am a cosigner.",
    "question": "Over 5 years ago when I was married I cosigned for my oldest daughters student loan, it was through Sallie Mae, now Navient. I was advised earlier this year that she was 90 days delinquent so Navient contacted me. Needless to say this has now become my debt, she is 32 years old, I am divorced from her father, and I shouldn't be responsible for her debt. Please give me some options as to how I can remove myself from this loan.",

        "It is your debt, and it become your debt the minute you signed the note. Another AVVO lesson about what it means to co-sign with someone.\nThis has to be a private student loan debt, as federal loans do not require co-signers and private student loans do. There are no income based repayment plans as there are for federal student loans. So either pay them, or don't pay them. If you get sued for non-payment, an attorney may be able to defend you based upon a chain of title issue or standing, but that is all speculative (based upon your being sued in the future). For now, no attorney can put this toothpaste back in the tube, you were the one who decided to sign on the dotted line.",
        "Unfortunately when you signed the agreement to help your daughter get a private student loan, you became responsible for repayment. You cannot \"remove yourself\" from the loan because you do not want to be responsible for it. Your best option may be to communicate with your daughter and work with her, and with the lender. There may be a way to get the loan back on track. If a default occurs despite your efforts, contact a student loan expert to evaluate whether there are defenses.",
        "You cannot \"remove\" yourself from you obligation to pay this debt. Because you signed, it is your debt. Your options are to sue your daughter or to pay the loan. You might be able to negotiate a payment plan, and an attorney might be able to help you negotiate, but you owe the money and this debt cannot be discharged ni bankruptcy."

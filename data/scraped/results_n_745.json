    "title": "I live in California and owe Washington State Unemployment for Overpayment. Can this debt be declared in bankruptcy?",
    "question": "I am underwater and will likely have to file for bankruptcy. I owe about $30K to WA state for overpayment of unemployment benefits. Since this amount is the bulk of the debt if I can't discharge the Unemployment debt it doesn't make sense to declare bankruptcy. I'm divorced and employed. I live in a 5th wheel which I now own outright and have. 2012 car that is also unencumbered.",

        "The short answer is yes. To deny discharge they would have to file a Complaint to determine that the debt was caused by intentional fraud. I have been doing this for over 40 years and so far I have never seen California file such an action. I doubt Washington would bother either.\n\nWhat I would be concerned about is:\n1) Whether you have been in California long enough to qualify to use the California exemption system. It is better than the Washington exemptions. We would need to determine whether you can protect your 5th wheel or your vehicle. You may not want to file bankruptcy right now. It is impossible to tell until the attorney can go over where you were living over the last 2 1/2 years.\n2) What debts you were ordered or agreed to pay under a marital settlement agreement? You may find that you can get rid of the debt to the creditor but, if you were ordered to pay the debt rather than your exspouse, you could be liable to your exspouse if they have to pay the creditor. They can go into the family law court and have you ordered to \"indemnify\" or pay them back what they had to pay.\n\nThat is just a couple of issues that need to be looked at before you file a bankruptcy.\n\nYour case will be handled in the Sacramento Bankruptcy Court. I would recommend you find a quality bankruptcy attorney by looking at Avvo's own ratings of attorneys in the Sacramento region.

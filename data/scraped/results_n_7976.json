    "title": "A pre-lein was sent to me regular mail and not certified by my HOA",
    "question": "It wasnt certified but the amount of time was 30 days to pay but 15 days to dispute or make payment arrangements, have they followed the legal requirements?",

    "answers": [
        "No, they have not followed the legal requirements if the pre-lien letter was sent via regular mail instead of certified mail. The pre-lien notice is invalid for purposes of enabling the HOA to actually record a lien.\n\nCalifornia Civil Code ยง1367.1(l) provides that an HOA which fails to comply with the procedures set forth in Section 1367.1 (regarding pre-lien notification) shall, prior to recording a lien, recommence the required notice process.\n\nAll this means is that the HOA has to start over again with respect to the pre-lien notice. However, it should not prevent or delay the \"meet and confer\" process described in subdivision (c) of Civil Code ยง1367.1, which is part of the Davis-Stirling Common Interest Development Act.",
        "Also, who sent the letter? If it was a debt collector (even their attorney qualifies), they did not give enough time to dispute (30 days notice is required). You might have a Fair Debt Collection Practices Act violation."

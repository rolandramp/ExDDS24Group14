        "There is an old saying among bankruptcy lawyers that the \"SBA will take your first born child\" as collateral for any loan they provide.

        "I agree with Mr. Shields.

        "Yes. SBA loans are dischargeable in C7 BK. However, if you personally guaranteed the loan you may be personally liable. Personal liability is also dischargeable in BK.\nNo. Creditor cannot execute against 401(k) and other ERISA qualified assets. Most 401(k) plans are ERISA qualified. However, you must take action to protect the 401(k) from execution by creditor.\nConsult BK counsel to ensure C7 BK will accomplish your goals and is best solution for you.."

        "You just learned that you are the victim of identity theft and you need to review my legal guide on Avvo (go through my Avvo profile to access this legal guide for free). The guide will walk you through each step that you need to take to protect yourself and determine if there is anything else, by getting your credit reports for free, since if this person did it once, they likely did it more and your credit is probably badly damaged from it. You can restore your own credit better than any credit repair company.\n\nAlso, you will need a police report and an FTC Identity Theft Complaint, which is also explained in my Avvo legal guide, so that you can dispute this debt with the debt collector or payday lender. I would be careful about not sending them your private information on the FTC complaint, because payday lenders and their debt collectors are particularly aggressive and may simply take all the personal information that you have \"given them\" and use it to harm you further.\n\nYou may ultimately need to hire an experienced consumer credit attorney to help you resolve any disputes or violations of your rights that remain with this company or the credit reporting agencies.",
        "There's a law NY firm called Kaye Scholer, but they're a big and reputable firm and I can't imagine anyone from that firm acting as you've described, which sounds like fear-mongering and a shakedown.\n\nNo one sues anyone for a couple hundred dollars, and if they did, they wouldn't use a lawyer, because it wouldn' be cost effective and you can't be represented by lawyers in Small Claims court anyway.\n\nI'd ignore this.\n\nDisclaimer: Please note that this answer does not constitute legal advice, and should not be relied on, since each state has different laws, each situation is fact specific, and it is impossible to evaluate a legal problem without a comprehensive consultation and review of all the facts and documents at issue.

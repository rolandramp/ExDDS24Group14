        "I think it is very important that you mom go and see a good Family Law Attorney and also see a good Bankruptcy Attorney. There should be a defense to post separation debts that were not for the benefit of the community, but in my opinion that defense would work best if it were made clear in a Judgment, expressly stating what the date of separation is. By way of example only, you and your mom should take a look at Family Code section 910 (I am not saying this one statute is the full story, just that you should look at it):\n\nhttp://law.onecle.com/california/family/910.html\n\nPart (b) seems to say that the community estate might not be liable for debts incurred after separation. Again, this point would work best, if it were backed up with an actual Judgment of Dissolution stating what the date of separation was. Go see a Family Law Attorney about what needs to be filed.",
        "Maybe yes, maybe no. It is hard to imagine that individuals married for over a long period of time would have a lot of liquid assets, you would think most of the assets would be in real estate or stocks, bonds, etc. If Dad spends cash on gambling post separation then hopefully there are enough assets still available where Mom is not held for any responsibility for the debts. An attorney really needs to get into the particulars of the situation what, when, how and why, exact numbers, assets, debts etc. There is a whole lot to deal with, no simple answer although, your mother needs to be protected.",
        "Check with the court to see if the case has been dismissed at 5 years under the mandatory dismissal statute. If not, you'll need to get an attorney to continue to prosecute the case. If it was, you need to refile. In any event, you will need to address what he did with the assets, considering he was under an automatic temporary restraining order printed on the summons-IF he was served with divorce. Her being sued in bankruptcy court definitely requires consultation with a bankruptcy attorney. Generally, a party's income and debts incurred after date of separation remain there separate property.",
        "Legal cases in California must be completed in 5 years, or they are no longer valid. And it appears that your mother's original divorce case has already passed the 5 year mark, or it is about to pass that mark. So perhaps the best way to do this is for your mother to dismiss the original case and then start a new case with a new case number. It sounds like your Dad made a mess of the family's finances. Did your father just \"lose it\" when your mother filed for divorce? Some people just go temporarily crazy when they are sued for divorce. Try to be understanding of both your parents. I am sure they still both love you no matter what mistakes they have made. Your mother can file for divorce, but she should have an attorney help her because she obviously does not know how to make the divorce go forward in a timely manner.",
        "She should be protected but it will take a judgment and order of the court to assign the debts to your father. Most courts dismiss a divorce matter 5 years after filing if the matter has not been progressing. If the parties have not \"prosecuted\" the case for 5 years, then the court could dismiss it. She should seek legal assistance to make sure the debts are assigned to the father."

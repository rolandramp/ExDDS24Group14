        "I agree with my colleagues, your girlfriend filing for BK does not change you still be liable for the car loan. If you do not make the payments the creditor will repossess the vehicle and you will be on the hook for the deficiency balance, meaning they can sue you and then garnish your wages/execute a bank levy, etc.",
        "Absolutely. Her BK has nothing to do with the obligation for you to make payments on your own car. The other attorneys are correct.",
        "I agree with the response from attorney Larkin. Your girlfriends BK does not mean you get a free car.",
        "Yes, the lender has a security interest in the vehicle and if payments aren’t made they will repossess the car and come after you for any deficiency balance after they auction the car off. Your girlfriends personal liability as co-signer will be discharged in her bankruptcy case but that doesn’t take you off the hook."

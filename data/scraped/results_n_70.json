    "question": "I was involved in car accident the car had full coverage at the time but my insurance cancelled the policy, bc I let my sister use my car but what should I do now that I have no insurance and no protection? Can I change the tittle over to my sister or is bankruptcy my best option?",
    "answers": [
        "You need to call and consult with an attorney. There are too many issues and questions that need to be resolved. It sounds like your sister was either an excluded driver on your policy or she was living with you and you failed to disclose her on the application. Under those circumstances, the carrier may have a viable reason to deny coverage, not cancel the policy. If the forgoing is correct, then your options are to look at bankruptcy or sue your sister for the property damage. If the foregoing is incorrect, then you definitely need to consult with an insurance bad faith attorney to see if the denial of coverage is appropriate. I would consult with an insurance bad faith attorney first and then follow their advice.",
        "Since the accident already occurred, changing the title over to your sister won't really help you. I would like to know more information, such as who was at fault in the accident - was it your sister or the other party? If the other party is at fault, then their insurance should cover the property damage although your sister may be a prop 213 case. If you will have a balance owing on the vehicle as well as a personal injury claim by the other party (now assuming your sister was at fault), then it is possible that bankruptcy may be an option depending on what, or if, the injured party pursues you for anything.",
        "As you can tell from my colleagues' posts, we are confused as to your question. Here's my take---you indicate that at the time of the accident, you had full coverage and you were financing your car. The damages from the accident totaled your car and the value of your vehicle was less than the amount you owe on your loan. But what's your question? Also, assuming that you had insurance in effect at the time of the accident, then if your insurance company is alleging a coverage exclusion and thus, refusing to pay, then you need to contact a lawyer in your area and discuss whether or not the insurance company's decision is legally correct. It may not be. Good luck",

    "title": "Contemplating chapter 7. $100k unsecured debt but own cars, tax refund, pending civil lawsuit?",
    "question": "I have about $100k in CC debt. Lost my job last month, started a new one but the missed payment has pushed the minimums way out of my budget. I have been sued by one creditor and need to sign a stipulated judgment soon. I own a couple of cars, one free and clear one purchased less than 1 year ago and financed. I'm also expecting a tax refund and am currently plaintiff in a civil suit. Is chapter 7 a viable option? Will I lose my cars? Will I lose any potential settlement and tax refund? Will I be able to discharge the debt I've been sued for already?",

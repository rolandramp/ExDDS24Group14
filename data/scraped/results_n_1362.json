        "For a short term marriage like this, you may get six months of support based upon your need, his ability and your marital standard of living but spousal support is discretionary so it all depends on the judge. Your better bet is to get child support which is based upon guideline that the court cannot deviate from except is extraordinary situations. Good luck.",
        "Alimony is based on the income and expenses of the parties, as well as the length of the marriage. CA is a no fault state which means that the infidelity issue is irrelevant.",
        "In California, a divorce is really about splitting up the assets and debts, and deciding child custody, support, and visitation. The reason for the separation is not relevant and won't impact the judge's decision. Alimony for shorter marriages is usually determined by a mathematical formula. His infidelity is not likely to affect the amount of support or his custody/visitation rights.",
        "California is a no fault divorce state. That means the reason for the divorce is not relevant. Your husband's infidelity will not affect the amount of spousal support or child support you receive.",
        "That depends on the disparity in income between the parties. For shorter marriages, the typical length of spousal support is 1/2 the length of the marriage.",
        "Your husband will not have to pay you spousal support as punishment for infidelity, because we have “no fault” divorce in California, but that doesn’t mean he will not have to pay you support. Normally spousal support for a short term marriage will be for half the length of the marriage unless there are extraordinary circumstances that would require a longer period, such as an accident or illness or special needs of a child. As you have a child, he will also pay child support. How much he will pay for spousal and child support depends on many factors, chief among which are how much he earns, how much you earn, and the custody timeshare for your child. You can ask for temporary support while your case is pending, and for spousal support and child support as part of your Judgment. The factors considered by the court in determining the length and amount of a permanent spousal support award are in Family Code 4320. The mandatory child support principles in determining the amount of child support are in Family Code 4053. If you want to read those code sections, just do an online search for Family Code 4320 or Family Code 4053."

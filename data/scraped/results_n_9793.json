        "The question of dischargeability of credit card debt is more dependent on your history of borrowing and repayment than it is on whether you may have overstated income in most cases. There is a presumption that if you took cash advances within 70 days of filing, or used the credit card for luxury items within 90 days of filing, you did so without the intent to repay. These are only presumptions, however, and may be rebutted.\nIf, on the other hand, you just got the credit card by overstating income, charged it to the limit and plan to file for bankruptcy, expect the card issuer to file an adversary proceeding (lawsuit in bankruptcy court) to have the debt ruled nondischargeable."

    "title": "My Chapter 7 Bankruptcy Trustee has hired an accountant to do a tax return for the estate.",
    "question": "We have just received notification that there will be an accountant hired (that conveniently associates with the chapter 7 bankruptcy trustee assigned to our case) to complete a tax return for the estate. Long story short, a monetary settlement was reached, thus debts will be paid through that settlement. Why is a tax return being done for the estate? Must a tax return always be done? Also, if a tax return is being done, can this indicate to us that we are finally almost done with this 2.5 year process?",
    "answers": [
        "According to the IRS, in an individual (including husband/wife/sole proprietor) bankruptcy, the creation of a bankruptcy estate creates a separate taxable entity (of course!), so a chapter 7 trustee in an asset case must file a tax return. Most trustee's will hire an accountant to do this work for the estate. The accountant is employed by the trustee after approval by the court. The money in the bankruptcy estate, again after approval by the court, is used to pay the fees for the accountant. For reference see section 5.17.9.9 of the Internal Revenue Manual.\n\nOnce the trustee has done all the work necessary to wrap up the estate, he will still have to lodge a report with the US Trustee, then file that report with the court and have it approved. You could be several months from having your case closed. Hopefully, nothing held up your discharge in the meantime; that should have been granted, barring any extension or objection, about 2 /2 to 3 months after your initial meeting with the trustee.",
        "When a chapter 7 is filed, all of your assets listed in the schedules become part of the \"bankruptcy estate.\" The bankruptcy estate is a separate tax entity. If a Trustee receives funds for distribution to creditors, it is a taxable event. Most trustee's are not CPA's so they employ a CPA to prepare the tax return for the bankruptcy estate. The tax return and final report filed by the Trustee are usually the last things to be completed.",
        "Yes. It is fairly common for C7 trustee to employ tax accountant as part of administration of estate.\nNo. Tax returns are not always required. Need varies with facts of each case.",
        "It is not uncommon for a tax return to be required to complete a chapter 7 estate. For example if an asset is sold by a chapter 7 trustee that would have generated a capital gain had you sold the property outside of bankruptcy, then the bankruptcy estate will be required to pay capital gains taxes. Even if there is no taxable event. For example, if the only item sold was the debtor's home and had the debtor sold the home, there would have been no tax liability to debtor because IRS rules allow the profit for the sale of a home up to a specified amount tax free, provided the seller of the home resided there for more than two years prior to the sale. Since the bankruptcy estate takes the asset with the same tax attributes as the debtor, the estate would owe no taxes, but a tax return is still required to show the IRS that no taxes are owed.",

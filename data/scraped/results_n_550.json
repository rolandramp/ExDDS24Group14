        "Do you have other debts? Experience tells me that when you are confronting financial difficulties, there often is more than one past due obligation.\n\nThe reason I ask is that if you have at least $12,000 of debt that is beyond your ability to pay without compromising your ability to meet your basic needs, step one may be to consult with a qualified bankruptcy attorney. In the state civil court, the outcome is merely a judgment of whether the debt is owed or not. If you do not dispute that the debt is owing, the creditor is entitled to a judgment determining the amount of the debt. The only thing a civil judge in state court can do for you is to determine if the creditor should be allowed to garnish up to 25% of your paycheck, or perhaps a lower percentage based upon your claim of exemption. Similarly, the court can protect your exempt assets if you file the proper papers, but it cannot make the debt go away.\n\nThat requires a bankruptcy discharge. Before you spend money with an attorney trying to prove you don't owe a debt, when you do, you should first explore the bankruptcy option, which for less money and costs may result in wiping the slate clean and giving you a fresh start.",
        "The court will not take your income into account. The creditor can garnish your wages after obtaining a judgment and writ of execution, however, the process takes some time.

    "title": "What happens if heirs can't pay mortgage and home value is underwater?",
    "question": "My father has terminal cancer and has been given only a few months to live. His home is valued around $825K, but the balance is $865K. I'm the sole heir and cannot afford the monthly, almost $5K, mortgage payments, however I will be left with around $250K from life insurance. Other than the house, he has zero debt. I'm starting to worry what I will do, so I would like some advice. I have no plans to live in the house, so If I short sale or foreclose, would the life insurance money be protected? Or will the mortgage company attempt to get that money? What is my best option to simply walk away from the property?",

        "I agree with my Pennsylvania colleague. If the only probate asset is the house, you can let the property go to foreclosure and let the bank take the property. The key is to not place the asset in your name. Also, as the sole heir, you can disclaim the inheritance to make sure you do not inherit the property.\n\nI recommend you contact an attorney in your La Jolla to discuss disclaiming the property and protecting your assets.\n\nGood luck!",
        "The proceeds from the life insurance policy will not be part of your father's estate so far as creditors are concerned. You should review the policy to make sure it is still in effect, and any premium payments continue to be made during your father's illness.\n\nAs far as the house is concerned, any final action by the mortgage holder will take months after payments cease. By that time, a short sale could be accomplished or the home may rise in equity. Consider all your options, but resist the urge to pay your fathers' debts yourself. If you become a creditor you will have to wait in line with other creditors for payment!\n\nRegarding the mortgage company: If the house is held in trust, then a claim can be made against trust assets. If the house is not in trust, a claim might be made against his general estate.\n\nFor more specifics, you should probably consult with a probate attorney. In fact, you should do that anyway, to review (1) your father's health care directive, and (2) your father's estate planning documents, to make sure they are in order.\n\nBest wishes to you and your family.",
        "First and most important to know is that the life insurance is not a probate asset, so it is not subject to creditor claims of an estate. So you are not legally obligated to use the insurance proceeds to pay the mortgage company anything. Second, if the probate estate is insolvent, you may not even want to probate his will and merely let the mortgage company take back the property.\n\nHope this helps.

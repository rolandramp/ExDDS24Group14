        "I like your thinking and I do wish that there was a motion to seal the record or something like that, but unfortunately there’s not. There’s no way to make the bankruptcy report on your credit go away. The best you could hope for is that your stellar repayment history since then will bury the fact that you had the bankruptcy seven years ago.",
        "You cannot obtain any order from a court to remove your BK filing. Credit reporting agencies must only report accurate info. Your filing BK is accurate. It will remain on your credit report. That said, the impact of your BK lessens with the passage of time. If there were some significant circumstances that caused you to file BK, you can prepare a \"consumer statement\" which the credit reporting agencies must include in your credit report. Such a statement may mitigate your BK filing. Good luck and God bless."

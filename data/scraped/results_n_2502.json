    "title": "I'm planning to fire my current bankruptcy attorney. Do I still keep making my Chapter 13 payments?",
    "question": "My wife and I filed a chapter 13 bankruptcy 1/17/14, but we've been separated since 1/30/13, and now at the tail end of completing the divorce process. We're not agreeing on decisions that could incur more debt, and our bankruptcy attorney has been very unresponsive and unhelpful. I've decided to fire our current bankruptcy attorney after he signed off on a cure for a community property rental house I wanted to foreclose on, but my wife wanted to try to sell (there is no money in the house). He clearly cannot continue to represent both of us together. Another bankruptcy attorney advised that I just dismiss and refile my own 13 with a new attorney. Should I then stop making payments on my current plan and save my money for my re-file?",

        "Your current lawyer certainly cannot keep representing both of you and should withdraw from the case ASAP. He has a clear conflict.\n\nThe answer is 'it depends.' Go meet with a bankruptcy attorney or two. Find one that seems to have a good plan for helping you move forward and hire him or her. They will advise you, based on your facts, the best way for you to move forward.",
        "Based on your current situation, I think it best for you to dismiss yourself out of this case and file a case alone with a new attorney. In fact a joint petition should have never been filed originally because the conflict already existed.",
        "Your choice, but if you stop making your plan payments, expect your chapter 13 to be dismissed. Any balance in your trustees hands will likely be used to pay then balance of the attorney fees remaining. Would this be cutting off your nose to spite your face? I don't know enough about your circumstances to say. Hope this perspective helps.",
        "FIrst, EACH of you new your own new bankruptcy attorney as a result of the actual and or possible conflicts of interest for the attorney who filed for both of you.\n\nSecond, THE MOST IMPORTANT IS WE DONT KNOW IF YOU HAVE PAST DUE INCOME TAXES OWED AND IF SO IF THEY WERE NON-PRIORITY. IF so, dismissing your case may result in turning non priority income taxes into possibly priority (and non-dischargeable) income taxes..so before you do anything, if that applies, speak to a bankruptcy tax attorney.\n\nThird, you can bifurcate a case and or dismiss and refile some type of case or convert to a ch 7. Noone can advise you on which action you should take as a result of it taking time to determine all the issues, facts, income, assets, and types of debts and then YOUR goals! Thus, meet with a new experienced bankruptcy attorney now.",
        "I'm in agreement with Mr. Harrell. It would probably be less costly and beneficial for you to move for you to file a motion with the court to deconsolidate/bifurcate your joint bankruptcy case into two separate cases. I would recommend that you immediately consult one or two knowledgeable chapter 13 attorneys to discuss this further. In terms of payments under the plan, plan payments generally start within 30 days from the filing of the plan, but you should see what the plan provides for. The trustee can move to dismiss the case if the plan payment is not made so you should make sure that you and your wife reach some type of agreement regarding the first payment to ensure that it is made pending your retention of counsel and motion to bifurcate the case. So definitely, seek to retain competent counsel soon who can advise you and promptly move to bifurcate the case. You can also contact the chapter 13 trustee's office to see if there is anything that they might recommend that you to do. Best of luck, Barbie D. Lieber",
        "You can hire a bankruptcy attorney, and file a motion with the court to deconsolidate your case. If the motion is granted, you will pay a deconsolidation fee, and then file your own petition, plan, and schedules. This is a better option for you and your wife than dismissing the current case, and refiling. You have more potential problems with the automatic stay, and with creditors, if you dismiss the current case, and refile another case later. Discuss your options with experienced bankruptcy counsel."

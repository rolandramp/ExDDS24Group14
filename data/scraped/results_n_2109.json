    "title": "Chase released lien / Debt still owed",
    "question": "I have a first & second mortgage & the house is underwater. Its almost back up to the amount of the first mortgage. Almost.. It was bought in 2005. Due to financial circumstances I & my co-borrower have not paid on the second in approx. 5-6 years. The first is current but only paying the interest as in the terms of the loan till 2016. The loans have been passed around from lender to lender. My 2nd ended up in the hands of Chase. They have just released my lien & has been recorded, which should be good news. However that did not relieve my obligation to pay the note. I had to file for Chapter 7 in 2012 & my co - borrower 7 yrs ago. However that still does not wipe out my debt as at that time it was a secured loan. The note is for 125,000.00. My worry is that now its an unsecured loan, Chase can sue for a judgment for payment. And if we can't make the payment and Chase is awarded the judgment wages will be garnished.",

        "A Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge will apply to all debt you owe as of the date of the filing of the bankruptcy. The discharge will apply to your personal liability on a secured debt. The security interest will ride through the Chapter 7 bankruptcy, however if the lender voluntarily releases the lien post-discharge then you now have discharged your personal liability through the Chapter 7 and the lien has been released by the creditor. Congratulations you have the best of both worlds, now you need to do a loan modification on the first mortgage to make it affordable or refinance if there is value in the property. Chase cannot sue you on a discharged obligation the only rights they had were to foreclose on the security interest, which they voluntarily released. Stop worrying. Chase released the lien because they made more money off the government guarantee or wrote you off on one of several settlements they are now involved in due to the bad practices pre bailout.",

        "Simiple:\n\nWhen you go to court to fight the restraining order ask the judge if he/she is going to continue the restraining order to carve out the exception for you to bring a small claims action against her for the money she owes. The judge can order an exception to the order at the hearing.\n\nBe careful on how you proceed, even with the order to make sure you don't violate it and end up in trouble. Many times judges will continue the restraining order, even if not warranted, just to make the party bringing the action feel comfortable.\n\nGood luck with your situation.\n\nMatthew Williamson",
        "If you were going to sue this person through a lawyer, I'd say no problem. However, since it is small claims court, where lawyers aren't involved and you would be acting as your own attorney, I would put the matter on hold, if possible, until you've resolved the restraining order issues.\n\nYou are entitled to exercise your legal rights, but the restraining order most likely says you are to have no contact with this person. Even sending the person a summons and complaint might be considered contact. (Of course, the summons would have to be served by a third party, since you can't serve legal documents in your own case.)\n\nIf it looked like the lawsuit was an attempt to harass the other person, instead of resolving a legitimate legal dispute, you could also find yourself in big trouble.\n\nIf you must move quickly on this issue -- for instance, if the statute of limitations to sue is about to run -- I would ask the judge for clarification at the next court hearing on the restraining order.\n\nRestraining order matters can be very tricky. You may want to hire a lawyer to represent you... and advise you on whether your should proceed with a lawsuit at this time."

    "question": "Can we use 704.070?",
    "answers": [
        "The good news about the 704 exemptions is that you get a big exemption for your home: $100,000 if you live in the house with your spouse or another family member. If you live alone it's $75,000. But the bad news about the 704 exemptions is that you get no wild card exemption (for money in the bank, tax refunds, etc.)\n\nThe good news about the 703 exemptions is that you get the 23,250 wild card exemption but nothing beyond that for your home. I always do everything I can to try to use the 703 rather than the 704 exemptions.\n\nTake a good look at the value of your home. Maybe it's worth less than you think. Maybe you can use the 703 exemptions.\n\nIf you really need to use the 704 exemptions then you need to make sure that on the day you file you have no money in the bank or any property that is not covered by one of the specific exemptions.",
        "Unfortunately, there is no wildcard under the 704 exemptions. There is no exemption that applies to tax refunds in 704.\n\nIf possible, file bankruptcy AFTER receiving and consuming your tax refund. You should not spend a refund on the purchase of new assets because those assets will become property of the bankruptcy estate when you do file. The funds should be used to pay ordinary and necessary expenses. A perfectly good way to spend down your refund is to pay your bankruptcy attorney's fees, if you have an attorney. Otherwise, the tax refund is an unexempt asset of the bankruptcy estate. Good luck!",

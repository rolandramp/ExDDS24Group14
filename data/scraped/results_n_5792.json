    "title": "If I owe more than the car is worth and I filed chapter 7BR, what are my options on keeping the car at value?",
    "question": "The car is worth 24,000 and I owe 38,000. The BMW dealer wants me to sign reaffirmation continuing the loan as is. I wrecked this car a few months back which caused $14,000 worth of damage of which my insurance company paid. I have been payng on an original loan of 38000 plus 2.9% interest for over a year and the balance is still $34,000. My monthly payment is $700.00. I made one payment eventhough I am in bankruptcy status. Can you assist me?",
    "answers": [
        "The only way to keep your car at its fair market value is by filing a Motion to Redeem. In a redemption, your lender will be paid by the redemption company, who basically refinances your vehicle at the court approved value. You will first need to contact a redemption company. I usually refer my clients to 722 Redemption @ (888) 721-2800. Once you are approved by the redemption company, the redemption company may prepare the motion for you so that you can file it with the court ( I may be wrong as I am unsure if they do this when you are not represented by an attorney). In my district, vehicles are usually redeemed at the retail value. Other than the redemption option, if the lender is not willing to negotiate on the amount/interest rates for a reaffirmation, then you have the option of surrendering your vehicle.",
        "In chapter 7 bankruptcy, \"retain and pay\" or \"ride through\" (maintaining payments notwithstanding discharge of liability) MAY be an option for vehicle retention.

Reaffirmation (which can defeat the bankruptcy \"fresh start\" purpose) has benefits and drawbacks; the latter would especially apply with a severely depreciated product of Bavarian Motor Works. See my bankruptcy blog (below) on financed motor-vehicle treatment in bankruptcy.",
        "Unfortunately in a chapter 7 bankruptcy your only options are to surrender the car, that is, to give it back to the creditor or be prepared to pay the outstanding balance on the debt.

        "There is nothing you can do in Chapter 7. You either pay the regular payments to keep the car (and sign a reaffirmation agreement), or you surrender the car. There are more options in Chapter 13, but only if the loan is more than 2 and a half years old.",

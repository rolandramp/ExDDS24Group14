    "title": "My friend wants to surrender her car (Hyundai) while she filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy 45 days ago.",
    "question": "She has already attended 341 meeting. She can't afford auto insurance, parking fees, and others, so she wants to surrender her car. She tries to drop her car where she bought it, but the dealership is located 100 miles away from her location. Can she drop her car to any Hyundai dealership or should she need to contact Hyundai Motor Finance first to find out where to drop it? or can she call Hyundai Motor Finance to ask to send a repo man? What is the best way to surrender it for her situation?",
    "answers": [
        "The debtor can call Hyundai and they will arrange to pick up the vehicle on an agreed upon date. She does not need to take the vehicle anywhere, just make sure she keeps the insurance in force until it is picked up by the creditor.",
        "It is the creditor she owes that she needs to surrender to. Someone else may tow and then she may have in fact a post petition non dischargeable debt. She can all and ask them to pick it up. They may not do it till 45 days after that 341 meeting or some wait till discharge but they can get it 45 days later or court order earlier. I would drive it for free if possibly until the get it. Just change insurance to cover personal injury! Good luck and thanks for asking!",
        "She tells the person who owns the loan that she will surrender the car. And they can choose when, if and how to take it - they could choose to leave it with her for a while."

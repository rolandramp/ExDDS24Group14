    "title": "Ten years ago I was convicted and arrested for welfare fraud. It went to trial, 12 jurors found me not guilty of 11 counts .",
    "question": "Now 10 years later I get a letter treatening to take my state & federal income taxes for an over payment I got a hearing and my case was dismissed ( in there favior). They said I recieved a notice of action 10 yrs ago and at that time did not ask for a hearing, in which I had 90 days to do so? In other words they are saying I had my chance and failed I don't recall getting a letter. I looked on the computer and found some information that stated the county has the burden of proof and that i can not be expected to pay back for failure to request a hearing with in 90 days? That a notice of action is not enough proof ? . I thought that minor children were entitled to benefits with out repayment. How can this much time pass and all of a sudden I have an over payment?

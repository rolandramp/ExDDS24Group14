        "The FL-160 is used to state your community and separate property declarations. An equalization payment is one that is awarded by judgment or stipulation of the parties after adjudication or settlement of the division of community property items. If there is an equalization payment ordered, then it should be included in the stipulation or judgment and does not need to be stated on the FL-160. Seek legal assistance.",

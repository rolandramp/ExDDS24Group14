        "It depends what does your cerdit card contract says. It probably gives the store or whoeever they assign the debt to the right to sell the debt to a collection agency, and sue you for the principle balance, interest, penalties or late fees, and their legal fees. But without reviewing the contract, I'm guessing that's what it says. They can probbaly also cancel the card.\n\nIt seems unlikely they'd take steps like that for a debt of $700, even with 5 months of no payments, but if they can, they might.\n\nDisclaimer: Please note that this answer does not constitute legal advice, and should not be relied on, since each state has different laws, each situation is fact specific, and it is impossible to evaluate a legal problem without a comprehensive consultation and review of all the facts and documents at issue.

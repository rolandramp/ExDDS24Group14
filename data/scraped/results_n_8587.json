    "title": "I filed bankruptcy Chapter - - Can Best Buy do this?",
    "question": "I got a letter from Best Buy wanting to get a TV that I bought on store credit. I got laid off and my credit protection paid my bill to the maximum coverage amount. That covered the amount for the TV, but interests and fees brought my account back up to where it was before I was laid off.",

        "If HSBC (the actual creditor here because they write the Best Buy Credit Cards) did not file a financing statement with your state's business authority, then the lien that they have was not perfected (meaning that it only applies between you and the creditor). Now, you mention that you sold the TV. A lien without collateral is not much of a lien. It is an unsecured debt. Let the creditor now that the TV is gone and that should end their interest.\n\n[This communication is intended as general information and not specific legal advice, and this communication does not create an attorney-client relationship.]",
        "The practice among attorneys whom I know is to either demand proof of the security interest, which they don't usually provide, or to ignore the demands of the creditors. If you were represented, your lawyer can let you know how s/he handles it. If you're on your own, Best Buy may be a bit more aggressive, but I've never seen them take back any item. If they do continue to make demands, make an offer to them based upon what you could get for it on the open market or at a pawn shop today.",
        "Technically they are not paid off. They have a secured loan on the TV and that means that normally you would have to sign a reaffirmation agreement and pay off the loan to keep the property. On the other hand even when these demands are ignored I have never seen Best buy, Wells Fargo or Dell computer force the issue nd retrieve the property. you do not have it and can't give it back. Talk to your lawyer, but the best strategy may be to aviod contact with them."

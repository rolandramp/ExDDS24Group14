        "Depends if your case was a \"no-asset,\" chapter 7 case - meaning did the trustee take any of your assets and pay your creditors? By far, most chapter 7 cases are \"no-asset\" cases which means that you were able to exempt and keep all of your assets which means the trustee took nothing from you.\n\nIf your case was a \"no-asset\" case, [here's some bankruptcy nerd talk] under the Ninth Circuit case of In re Beezley (recently followed by the Bankruptcy Appellate Panel in In re Heilman), the forgotten creditor has no claim against you.\n\nHowever, this comes with the important caveat that the claim survives if it was not dischargeable in the first place. So if the creditor had a viable claim for fraud, or the creditor was the ex seeking child support etc., those would not have been discharged anyway. A debtor cannot mistakenly or intentionally omit a creditor with a nondischargeable claim and then have it discharged. But if it was the typical credit card or broken lease, it is likely dischargeable.\n\nProbably a good idea to contact counsel. Good luck.\n\nThis information is not, nor is it intended to be, legal advice. This does not constitute the formation of an attorney-client relationship.

        "You need to speak to an attorney in your local area. There is a theory of law that says that if it was a no-asset Chapter 7 case that all debts are discharged, regardless of whether they were listed. I am not licensed in your state and therefore do not know the posture of that theory in California, but a local bankruptcy attorney would.\n\nIf not, then you may be able to re-open your case to add the inadvertently omitted creditor, then have the judge declare that the debt was dishargeable, and then be free of that debt. Here I would have to advise that you will have to weigh the expense of going through that procedure vs making a deal on the debt with the creditor.\n\nGood luck to you.",
        "Are you talking about your credit report or your bankruptcy schedules? If it is your credit report, some creditors do not report. There is no harm done. No law requires that creditors report. However, federal law requires creditors to report correctly if they do.\n\nIf you are asking about your bankruptcy schedules, then my colleagues have already answered your question.",
        "The best practice is to amend the petition in schedule F and include the creditor. It is much cheaper to do it before your case closes so contact your attorney right away. If they file a letter with the Court asking them to keep the case open for the amendment you will not have to pay to reopen the case and will have time to amend."

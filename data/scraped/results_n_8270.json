    "title": "Water company sent to collections before bill is due?",
    "question": "My water was shut off on 12/21/10. I was given a \"FINAL BILL\" on the 1/5/2011 with a due date of 2/01/2011. I called them on the jan. 7th to confirm that I have until feb 1st 2011 to pay the bill before it goes to collection. Then today,(jan 19), I get a bill ,(dated jan. 11), from a collection agency for the water bill. How can they send my bill to collections when my due date is still 2 weeks away? I have been having problems with them. I told them I lost my job and if they could give me an extension and they said no. I asked if they could take of the late fees and or the $20 door hanger charge. They said no. Now if I want my water turned back on, I have to pay the balance. Open a new account, since they closed my account. $35 enrollment fee. and a $450 deposit.",

        "In a Chapter 13, you propose a plan to repay your creditors for 3 or 5 years (usually 5). You must start paying the plan payment a month after you filed. There is a trustee you oversees your case. You make the payment to them. They will ask you for certain information, which you must provide. You most work with them to get your plan approved by the Court. Creditors must file a proof of claim to be paid. The amount listed in the claim controls, unless you object to it. If you have a mortgage or car loan, you most pay it every month too or they will ask the Court to remove it from the Bankruptcy.\n\nIn a Chapter 11, you must also propose a plan, but it is much more flexible than an Chapter 13. You act as you own trustee. Usually, an individual will chose to file it if they are over the Chapter 13 debt limits or they have a non-residential property(ies) where they want to restructure the loan. However, that means that the Office of the United States Trustee oversees your case. They require a lot of information, which is due seven days after you filed. The information you need is on their website. When you file, you need to close all your bank accounts and open special accounts. You may have to file motions call \"first day motions.\" Every month you will have to do a monthly operating report, which will be filed with the Court. You will also have to pay quarterly fees to the UST. Some creditors are extremely aggressive and will try to make the Bankruptcy difficult. The UST will also be difficult if you did not do all their requirements in a timely manner. You will need an experienced attorney who routinely does Chapter 11s and confirms them. Most require a larger retainer and bill hourly after the retainer has been extinguished. There is a lot of work to do! There is much more, but you really need to consult a Bankruptcy attorney to see if it is best for you.",
        "I can't believe no one actually answered your question. If the debtor is a business entity, it can't chose chapter 13. If the debtor owes more than $1,000,000, with rare exceptions, chapter 13 is not an option. Leaving chapter 11 as a choice for an LLC or corporate debtor, or an individual with substantial debts. The two are sort of like the difference between a Kia and a Mazerrrati. Hope this perspective helps!",
        "In Ch7, you discharge all of your dischargeable debts within a few months ... it is the least expensive, but you may not qualify if your income is too great and/or you have assets that can't be exempted.\nIn Ch13, you pay a percentage of your debts over a 3 to 5 year plan and discharge the rest upon completion.\nIf you have too much debt to qualify for Ch13, or you want to restructure a business, a Ch11 can be filed; but it is very expensive."

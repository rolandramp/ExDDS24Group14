        "Almost all divorce decrees state that both parties are equally responsible for unreimbursed medical costs. There are notice requirements for the party seeking reimbursement but you are likely responsible. If there is fraud on her part then you have a different problem",
        "Child support is separate from health insurance and payments of medicals that insurance does not cover are all separate issues. If you look in your custody orders you will probably find that you and your ex are responsible for maintaining health insurance and probably co-responsible for making medical payments. Review your order",
        "Just 'cause you pay child support doesn't make you not responsible for paying your child's medical debts as well. Take a look at your divorce decree & see what it says about your responsibility for medical debts. All the decrees I have ever seen provide that both parties must contribute to paying for the child's medical expenses.\n\nI am moving your post over to divorce so that you can also get the answer from the local family law attorneys. Hope this perspective helps!"

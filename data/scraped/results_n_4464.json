        "You cannot waive the right to file bankruptcy. The stipulation, which appears in every settlement agreement I have ever seen, is unenforceable as a matter of law.",
        "Even if you have one debt that is nondischargeable in a Chapter 7 Bankruptcy, that does NOT mean that you can't file a Chapter 7 Bankruptcy. If you do file a Chapter 7 Bankruptcy, ALL of your debts should be listed. The bankruptcy Court decides what is dischargeable and what is not. Lots of people have 1 or more nondischargeable debts. They still file Chapter & Bankruptcies.\n\nOf course, you can always use a Chapter 13 Bankruptcy to get control of nondischargeable creditors and force them to take reasonable payments. Good luck.",
        "Generally, such a stipulation is unenforceable but more details are needed to give you useful advice. Send me a copy of the document and call to discuss in particular."

    "title": "What can what can I do to get a monthly statement from my Mortgage Company?",
    "question": "I was injured on the job and was forced to file bankruptcy save my home. Making my bankruptcy payments and making my mortgage payments sometimes got a little difficult and I end up missing a few mortgage payments. However overtime I paid extra and I think I should be all caught up. I have about 4 months to go before I am out of bankruptcy but the mortgage company is refusing to send my monthly statement. Mortgage company is saying that they send the statements to the attorney, the attorney is saying they have not been sending them any mortgage statements. I have 4 months to go and I want to make sure everything is in order. The reviews on this Mortgage Company says that they have a reputation of foreclosing on people when they thought things were okay. I hope my mortgage company and my attorney have some kind of conspiracy to take my home. I have equity and a low balance and once I am out of bankruptcy I will be just fine. What should I do to assure I get a monthly statement before I emerge from bankruptcy. I don't want any surprises.",

        "If you are catching up on your delinquent mortgage payments as part of your Plan, part of your trustee's job when your case is paid off is to contact the lender to confirm that your mortgage is now current before issuing a report to the court. Hope this perspective helps!",
        "I run into this issue all the time. Lenders send me mortgage statements instead of the client. Your lawyer should forward all statements to you. In the meantime, your lawyer can send a letter to the lender authorizing them to mail you the statements. This works most of the time. However, many lenders are not good at reading. They may continue to send statements to your lawyer. I sometimes had to tell lenders on multiple occasions to send statements to my client, only to have them continue sending them to me.\n\nOne piece of good news. The lender must certify to the court that your payments are either current or behind. This certification will happen after you make your final payment. This procedure protects you from nasty surprises.",
        "Apparently, you do not have a BK lawyer helping you. If that is right, congratulations on getting your paperwork filed correctly, getting your Plan filed and complying with all the requirements including the demands of the Trustee. That said, the mortgage lenders hardly ever send you monthly statements because of their unwarranted \"fear\" of violating the automatic stay against trying to collect from you. You will have to monitor your payments by keeping copies of all checks, money orders, or electronic payments. If you get too far behind, the lender will seek and order lifting the automatic stay so they can commence or continue a foreclosure of the mortgage. You will receive written notice from the lender's lawyer if this happens. Don't ignore any such papers. At this point you will have to get more legal help than asking what to do next from the Avvo volunteer lawyer. Good luck and God bless.",
        "Your attorney should know the answer. This cannot be only happening to you.\n\nGood luck."

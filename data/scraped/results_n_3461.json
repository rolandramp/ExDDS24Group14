    "question": "My father passed away without a will. He does not have many assets, but does have property with about $100K worth of equity in it. I am the youngest of my father's children and none of his other children have any interest in the property. My dad has seven other children besides myself. I have been told that, if all seven children sign quitclaim deeds, the property will be able to be transferred to me with a shortened probate period. Is this true? If so, what is the process like, and how long with the property have to be in probate before the title is transferred to me?",

        "You were told wrong and given bad information. The probate process is your only option. The value of the estate is based on the gross value of the property, not its net value. The probate process can be done with relative ease depending on the debts of the estate. If your siblings do not want the property as their inheritance, then they will have to sign a waiver of their rights to the property . But get a probate attorney to help you with this.",
        "Mr. Palley is correct. Just for clarification - your siblings do not own the property so they cannot sign a deed related to the property. Your father's estate owns the property and only a court appointed representative can sell the property or transfer it in any way. Your siblings can assign their interests to you in the probate process but just know, there may be gift tax consequences for them doing so. If you plan to keep the property and not sell it, you will have to determine how those taxes will be paid.",
        "I am sorry for your loss and sorry to report you may have been given misinformation. You will need to through probate. It's not clear what level of probate. It is determined by the gross value (not equity) of the property. If less than $150k then you could get everybody to sign assignments to you and do an under $150k probate petition which takes two months. If over $150k then a full probate is required and it takes about 8 months. Good luck. -John"

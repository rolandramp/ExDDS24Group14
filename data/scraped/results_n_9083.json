    "title": "Can a company that buys a business refuse to pay the outstanding bills for that business?",
    "question": "A restaurant owes my business almost $1,000 since last August. The business was bought and taken over as of April 1st. I was told that the company that bought this business was not legally obligated to pay outstanding bills that they were those of the last owner who would not be paying anyone. Is that legal? What can I do?",

        "My colleague is correct. There is a difference between purchase of the whole business and an asset purchase. If this was an asset purchase former owner is still legally responsible and you can sue them in small claims court. If this transaction was required to comply with CA Bulk Sales law and did not, new owner may also be liable.\n\nI would sue old and new together in small claims and let them point fingers at each other for liability.\n\nThe response given is not intended to create, nor does it create an ongoing duty to respond to questions.

        "First find out if it was a stock purchase or an asset purchase. You need to get a copy of the purchase agreement.

If it is unsecured debt (meaning there is no lien on the assets to secure the debt), ask the buyer for a copy of the bulk sale notice. Depending on the size of the transaction, the publication or delivery of a bulk sale notice is required to absolve the buyer of the seller's unsecured debts.

    "title": "How does the plaintiff (creditor) ask the court for an enforcement judgment after debtor defaults on stipulated judgment?",
    "question": "A debtor in a bankruptcy adversary proceeding is defaulting on the payments agreed to in a stipulated judgment. After a breach letter is sent per the agreement, is there a requirement to ask for an enforcement judgment with the bankruptcy court if the debtor is defaulting on the stipulated judgment?",
    "answers": [
        "If you are the judgement creditor in the bankruptcy case, and you reached a settlement with the debtor, and there has been a breach by the debtor in the payment of the stipulated judgment, you may now file a declaration regarding the default and get a writ of execution to enforce your judgment. Good luck to you",
        "The procedures should have been included in the stipulation. For example, in a stipulation in one of my cases, the agreement provided that my client just had to file an affidavit of non-compliance to obtain a judgment for the full amount, less whatever was paid."

        "I agree with my colleagues. Without further information, you would need to list the entire rent on your schedules if you are the sole leaseholder. If you only pay for your room, and someone else signed the lease with the landlord, then you would not list others rents as income, and only list your portion of the rent as an expense. Good Luck.",
        "It really depends on the situation. If you are on the lease alone, without your roommates, then you are responsible for the entire rent owed and you would list that as an expense. You would then list the contributions of your roommates as income since that offsets the amount paid to the landlord. If you are not on the lease, then I would say you just include your share of the rent as an expense and you do not list the other roommates' contributions as income. If you are on the lease with your roommates, I suppose it would go either way.",
        "Generally, if you are not actually the one that is receiving the rent, then it does not count for the purpose of qualifying for a Chapter 7 bankruptcy or determining your debt repayment ability in a Chapter 13 bankruptcy. You will, however, need to fully disclose your gross monthly income and expenses.",
        "No. You do not keep the rent. You do not even collect the rent. There is no reason for you to consider the rent paid by the other roommates to be your income.",
        "While I agree with the contributors that it depends on how the \"household\" handles the obligations and whether you are listed on the lease with the other roommates, generally the answer is no unless you share all expenses together. I would have a difference between how this is listed under the Means Test v. Schedule J expenses. For example, if you share the utilities and only list your share of the payments in Schedule J, that would be an accurate disclosure of your expenses.\nEven if what would apparently be simply questions, it is beneficial to review any questions with an experienced bankruptcy attorney."

        "The answer may depend on many facts not mentioned in your question. For example, the statute of limitations on a negotiable promissory note is six years under the Uniform Commercial Code. This period may be extended further if the borrower made payments on the loan or acknowledged the indebtedness in writing before limitations expired. Guarantees are subject to the four year limitations period under California law, but they often contain provisions waiving the statute of limitations. The effect of these waivers is limited by statute in California. Often,commercial loan documents state that they are governed by the law of a different state than the one in whcih the borrower is located. Confirming for certain that limitations has expired requires that a lawyer examine your documents and get all the facts. Good luck.",
        "If you're referring to a written loan made to a business under California law, then you have up to four years from the date of the breach of contract or last payment, whichever is later.",
        "Like all written contracts, in CA, it's 4 years from the date of breach (not from the date you first signed the loan document).\n\nSBA loans are guaranteed by the individual personally, so whether you took out the loan as an individual, or using a DBA, an LLC, or a corporation, you're liable, unless the SBA and/or the bank that funded the loan has let the statute expire. The expiration of the 4 year statute gives you an iron-clad defense to any lawsuit they'd bring.\n\nDisclaimer: Please note that this answer does not constitute legal advice, and should not be relied on, since each state has different laws, each situation is fact specific, and it is impossible to evaluate a legal problem without a comprehensive consultation and review of all the facts and documents at issue. This answer does not create an attorney-client relationship."

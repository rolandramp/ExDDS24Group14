    "title": "How can I sue Expedia in small claims court?",
    "question": "Expedia cancelled my June 1, 2020 trip to Belgium and have not refunded me even though they first said it will take 7 to 8 weeks. Now they say I have a credit. I do not want a credit, I want my money back. The cost of the plane ticket was only $856.56. What should I do?",
    "answers": [
        "The only way you can sue Expedia in Small Claims court is if their terms (which you agreed to when you used them to buy your travel tickets) say that that's the dispute resolution method the parties agreed to.\nSo you need to review those terms; that's where their cancellation/refund policy is also.\n\nAnother thing you can try is a dispute through your credit card company, which has way more clout than you do. VISA or Mastercard may be able to issue you a refund right away while they wait to see is Expedia fights the refund.",
        "You need to read your Expedia contract carefully. If it says no refunds and only a credit will be given when a flight or trip is cancelled, you agreed to that. Plus, your Expedia contract may also require you to participate in mediation or arbitration to resolve any disputes. That rules out Small Claims. That said, filing and serving a Small claims suit may trigger a refund anyway because Expedia is concerned about its public image. They may refund your money even though they are not required to do so. Don't forget to lodge a complaint with BBB. Good luck.",
        "Review Expedia agreement regarding refund and credit policy with your attorney.\nIf you determine agreement in your favor, you may sue Expedia in small claims court.",
        "Odds are, all you are entitled to get is a credit. You can try to sue if you want, but the amount seems too small to involve an attorney. You would need to read the terms and conditions of the booking. What they may have \"told\" you and what they are obligated to do can be different.\n\nI get your frustration, I am in the same boat with a couple of airline tickets I had for travel in April and June which got canceled. You and I will likely agree that the \"right\" thing for the companies to do issue a refund, but contractually, they are likely only required to issue some sort of credit."

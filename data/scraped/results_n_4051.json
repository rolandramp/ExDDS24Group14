    "title": "To what extent is the unsecured portion of a mortgage discharged in a Chap 7 bankruptcy?",
    "question": "I need to reopen a Chap. 7 which was discharged in 2010. Subsequent to the discharge, my house was sold in a foreclosure sale in 2013. In a claim in 2010, the mortgage holder did not distinguish between the secured portion of $768k and the unsecured portion of $300k. The total amount continued to accumulate interest, etc. Thus, when the property was sold at foreclosure, the Notice of Default (NOD) showed liability of $1million plus. It now appears that the NOD amount may have been incorrect because the unsecured portion may have been discharged in the bk.",
    "answers": [
        "Your liability on the house was completely discharged in the Ch 7. There is no need to reopen case at this time. See a local attorney who can explain this in more detail to you.",
        "If you did not reaffirm, only the lien remained upon which the Lender has the right to foreclose.\nIt is common for the lien to be calculated on the basis of the loan (with interest), even if that loan was discharged in the bankruptcy.",
        "There is no reason to reopen a case on a discharged debt so your belief that you need to do so is not based on the law. Absent a reaffirmation your mortgages were all discharged as a matter of law! The notice of default was probably true in that it lists the amount of secured debt on the property irrespective of the amount discharged. WHy? what if the property sold for $2 Million for example..the 2nd mortgage would have been paid in full at the sale then! I hope my answer has assisted you. Speak to a local state bankruptcy attorney if you have any further questions so they can solve any concerns or stress you may have. Good luck. and dare I say....Go Seahawks!",
        "Your personal liability for any portion of the debt would have been discharged in your 2010 bankruptcy. The lien would not have been discharged, but the personal liability would have. Not sure why you are worried about this.",
        "The accounting that the mortgage company is making relates only to the value it is claiming in its lien against the property. If the mortgage company were to take steps to try to collect the deficiency against you, it would be a violation of the bankruptcy stay & you could take legal action against them for this. But you can't blame the mortgage company for wanting prospective buyers at the foreclosure auction to \"bid up\" the property based on the entire balance owed to completely satisfy the lien. Hope this perspective helps!"

        "Agree with all prior answers. You need to find a bankruptcy lawyer who has experience with adversarial proceedings. Adversarial proceedings have strict deadlines. It is best you be proactive and find a bankruptcy litigation attorney asap.\n\nBest of luck!",
        "I agree with all of the prior responses that have been posted, but I don't believe they are forceful enough! YOU HAVE A LOT TO LOSE IN THIS SITUATION! DON'T DELAY, CONSULT WITH A QUALIFIED AND EXPERIENCED BANKRUPTCY ATTORNEY TODAY! Do NOT contact the Trustee without speaking with your own Attorney first. Trustees are your enemy, they want to take money from you. They will twist and turn everything you say to their advantage; they will attempt to get you to make statements that will make their burden in the Courtroom much easier. Contact an Attorney to represent YOUR interests NOW! Best of Luck to you.",
        "My colleague Hale is correct. What you have received is Joint Status Report in an adversary proceeding.\n\nThe fact that you described this as a proceeding initiated by one of the Chapter 7 trustees to set aside transfers made in connection with a settlement and division of property interests suggests that the matter is being challenged as a fraudulent transfer. You refer to the other party as your \"ex-partner\" and as your \"ex\". It is not entirely clear whether you mean that the division was between you and a former spouse.\n\nIn any event, such transfers can be challenged in the bankruptcy courts, and frequently are. This is a very complex matter and you would be wise to consult with competent bankruptcy counsel experienced not only with bankruptcy litigation, but also family law if the transfers were made in conjunction with a proceeding for dissolution of marriage.\n\nBear in mind, unlike the majority of state and federal courts, you can be served with a summons and complaint in the bankruptcy system by mail directed to your last known address. You should have received the original summons and complaint in the mail, and the fact that you have received the Joint Status Report suggests the matter has progressed beyond the initial filing of the complaint.\n\nYou would be wise to act quickly to protect your rights by consulting counsel.",
        "I agree with my colleague. You need to meet with an experienced bankruptcy litigation attorney to understand your rights, responsibilities and options.",
        "You're in Costa Mesa, which is in OC, in the Central District of California. In CDCA, LBR 7016-1 is a form you can find from here https://www.cacb.uscourts.gov/forms/joint-status-report-lbr-7016-1a2 ... it's a status report that's completed when there's an adversary proceeding (like a court battle) inside a bankruptcy. It's not clear what the nature of this dispute is, though since you mention \"receipt of money\" from the sale of a house, it's possible the trustee is going after a transfer of assets made by the debtor in the time before they filed bankruptcy. You'll want to meet with a bankruptcy attorney from your area to preserve your rights with regard to the trustee's action. Good luck to you."

    "title": "Can I dissolve a company with a 50% shareholder who has been deported?",
    "question": "I own a company and have 50% shares owned by someone who was not quite straight with his business dealings and was jailed and deported. I owned the business for a few years before bringing this person on board. I still own the trademarks and was running everything. I do want to close this business and restart because I do not want this person's history to follow what I have worked so hard for. Can I dissolve this company and start over?",
    "answers": [
        "You can stop the present corporation with just your vote. You can also start a new corporation and transfer over the assets, including the trademark tax free. I suggest closing the old biz after you started the second biz. Then close down the old biz by year end.",
        "Yes, a California corporation may be discharged by at least 50 % of the shares that you own. A business attorney can help you through the process.",
        "Yes, a 50% shareholder may dissolve a corporation. Please see the post at the link below.\n\nAs my colleagues have stated, you should retain a business lawyer to ensure that the dissolution process and formation of the new business are done properly.\n\n(Fortunately, deportation of your colleague significantly reduces the likelihood that he can cause trouble in the future. One of my clients had what turned out to be an \"employee from Hell\", and it only was upon his jailing and deportation that my client could breathe a sigh of relief.)",
        "If you want to dissolve and setup a new corporation doing essentially the same thing, you should absolutely speak with a business attorney, as he or she will guide you through the steps. You do not want the current entity's debts and obligations transferred to the new company, so I advise that you consult with a business attorney before taking any steps toward dissolution.",
        "A 50% shareholder has the legal capacity to dissolve the corporation. To do so without legal or tax advice would be less than efficient.",
        "Disclaimer: The materials provided below are informational and should not be relied upon as legal advice.\n\nYou need to retain an attorney to review the facts and your paperwork with you in detail. After doing so, you can start discussing what would be the proper course of conduct to take."

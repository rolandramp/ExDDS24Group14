    "title": "I just received a levy on my bank Account",
    "question": "I live in California. In 1994 a financial judgement was entered against me for the debt that I owed. Unfortunately, I did not pay it because I was unemployed. But two weeks ago I received a letter from Sheriff's office that my bank account is levied to cover the money owed. Also, from the court paper, I noticed that the creditor's attorney went to court in 01/24/2004 to renew the case before the expiration of ten years status. Can he do that. and what can I do to stop or remove the levy from my account.Furthermore, the levid account is closed and I have other accounts in other banks. How do I protect the unlevid accounts because I use these account to support my children, pay rent and insurance. Please advise",

        "Those funds may be exempt from a bank levy, but you will need to prepare the proper Judicial Council (JC) forms and submit them immediately to the levying officer, who is usually the local county sheriff where the bank office is located. The link to the JC forms web site is below. You should select the forms under \"Enforcement of Judgment,\" and look for the Claim of Exemption form and the Financial Statement form. Sometimes you can even prepare these online for free and the print them and sign them. Be sure to click \"clear\" at the end to protect your privacy.

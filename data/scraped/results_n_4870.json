    "title": "In CA, can I serve a subpoena to ATT, asking for phone records after my husband's death? I'd rather not have to pay a lawyer!",
    "question": "Help! My husband, two sons and I had a family plan with ATT; the bills have always been in my name. In 2010, my husband asked ATT to separate his number from the family bill and bill it to another address. I don't know where, but he kept the same phone and number. Six months later he committed suicide. There was no note, and we have young kids. I inherited all of his possessions (and debts), and I'm the sole executor of his estate. This includes possession of his phone and phone number. I need to see his phone bill call data from the date he separated the billing, as it's the only way to solve the mystery of what he was doing in the days/weeks before he died, and hopefully find some answers and get closure. ATT says they can't release his statements to me without a court order.",

        "ATT will not release the records to you without a subpoena, and you cannot get a subpoena without a court case having been filed. If there is a probate pending, that would qualify. If not, then it is unlikely that ATT will release the records.",
        "If you are the executor of his estate, you have the authority to review and pay his bills. Go that route and avoid an embarrassing lawsuit with subpoenas ect. Keep this one in-house."

    "title": "False Judgement Filed against me, I think",
    "question": "A lawyer representing a debt collector put a freeze on my bank accout. I obtained a copy of the restraining order from my bank. On the top it told me the county of NY state and city for which the judgement was being held as well as an Index No. I called the county, gave them the Index No. They had nothing on file. I asked them to search for me by name. They had nothing on file. Meanwhile, the law firm (on the one rare occasion they answered their phone) refuses to provide me with any info other than what I already have. My issues are, why does the restraining order on my bank account say that it is in a county of New York that does not even have this judgement on file? Why was I not served? Why am I being sued in NY state when I now in and have lived in California for the past 7 months? What are my options here? I cannot afford a lawyer and will have to do everything on my own.",

The question is whether it was properly obtained in the first place. If the judgment is proper, they can execute on your assets in CA. If the judgment is not proper, they cannot do anything. You need to get a complete copy of the file in NY. I know the clerk says there isn't one, but I have had clerks tell me that my files do not exist either when I have a copy of it in front of me.

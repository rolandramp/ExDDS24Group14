        "So, the contractual relationship at issue here is between your insurer and yourself.\n\nAny terms allowing your husband to use your insurance are covered by the contract between your insurer and yourself. So, one way an insurer can hold you liable for any of your husband's uncovered deductibles and co-pays is through their contract with you. Furthermore, you and your husband are presumably legally married, and presumably legally married in the State of California, and not elsewhere. If that's true, then in California, under what is called \"Community Property\" law, either spouse may be held liable for the debts of the other, unless they have previously signed a prenuptial agreement specifically insulating either one or both spouses from the debts of the other spouse.\n\nAs for the issue of paying for services rendered, in additional to additional remedial services rendered, according to your representation of your husband's statements, the dentures and replacement dentures did not fit properly. While the insurer is billing you for the dentures, they are also billing you for medical labor, and typically-used medical supplies, in addition to the dentures. At the very least, your husband received the benefit of using their services to TRY a denture, and as a benefit received, he cannot request that money back. As for the billing of the dentures, you might have a legal case if you wanted to wait to have them enforce that claim against you, using a debt-collection agency. You could offer to settle at a 50% discount rate, explaining that you recognize you received some benefit, you didn't receive all the benefit, and would they be willing to split the difference.\n\nYou might hire an attorney under what is called a \"Limited Scope Agreement\" (link below) to set forth in writing your position in a \"demand letter\" to the insurer (a \"demand letter\" is the first step towards a lawsuit, without actually filing a lawsuit). Depending on their response, you could then hire an attorney to negotiate with the debt-collector, if it goes that far. If the insurer brings it to small claims, you may not hire an attorney to represent you and would have to represent yourself.",

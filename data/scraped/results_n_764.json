    "title": "I'm about to receive an inheritance but was planning on filing for Chapter 13 bankruptcy - would that money be seized?",
    "question": "I have a large amount of student loan debt. The monthly payments the debt holders want is more than I can afford and they will not negotiate with me. I was planning to file for Chapter 13 bankruptcy but I have suddenly received a fairly large inheritance from a relative who unexpectedly passed away. The total will not be enough to cover all of my debt but I want to file for Chapter 13 anyway. Would the inheritance be seized or given to the debt holders (these are private loans) or applied to the total Chapter 13 payment plan?",

        "I agree with most of what the other attorneys are telling you. The take away for you is that you need to contact a qualified attorney. There is such a thing as pre-bankruptcy planning, that could help you pay less to your unsecured creditors. Your situation is a bit complicated and you are going to need help to do it correctly.",
        "I agree with the former responses: you need to speak with a bankruptcy attorney. You should consider paying off your student loans with your inheritance before you file bankruptcy. Student loans, as a general rule are not dischargeable. If you use your inheritance to pay off your student loans, you will have to wait to file bankruptcy; however, you will be in a much better position than you would be if you file bankruptcy while you have your inheritance in hand. To the extent that your inheritance is not exempt in bankruptcy, it will have to go to pay your unsecured creditors \"pro rata.\" That means that each unsecured creditor will get a percentage share of the nonexempt portion of your inheritance. Your student loans are unsecured, so they will receive only a percentage of that $100.00. Why not pay 100% of your student loan before you file. Of course, this is a simplification. You really do need to see an experienced bankruptcy attorney before you do anything. Good luck.",
        "In addition to what my colleagues have stated, I implore you to seek a very reputable/qualified bankruptcy attorney to discuss your exemption planning options. What if you could protect some or all of the inheritance? It's imperative that you seek experienced counsel. If you have an attorney now, make sure they are equipped to handle a complicated case.",
        "What Robert Firth said. I'll add that means that you might be paying to your creditors through the 13 plan the amount of your inheritance less any exemption you can apply to it.",
        "In Chapter 13, you are proposing a payment plan at least partially in lieu of assets being seized. In Chapter 7, the inheritance could very well be taken by a trustee. In Chapter 13, the inheritance might be taken into consideration when decided how much you need to repay your creditors. I have had clients that need to pay over a portion of the inheritance, but you need to discuss the specific facts of your case with a local attorney that can give you more thorough guidance.",
        "As long as the total of the monthly payments equal or exceed the amount you have in excess of your exemption limits, you should be fine. This is called a \"liquidation analysis\". See your bankruptcy attorney for details. Don't have one? Big mistake. Over 90% of the chapter 13 bankruptcies that are filed without an attorney fail."

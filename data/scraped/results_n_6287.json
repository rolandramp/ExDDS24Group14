        "California law does not seem to require a lawsuit before an HOA may record a notice of delinquent assessment and place a lien on the property. If the statutory route was followed, then the lien is probably unavoidable under 11 U.S.C. 545, because by being recorded it is already perfected against a bona purchaser. In that case, it would appear that the HOA could foreclose its lien after the bankruptcy is over, even though it can never ask you to pay the dues (because your personal liability is discharged in the bankruptcy). If that's the case, then you might consider converting to chapter 13 and paying off (or stripping off) the judgment lien over the life of the plan.\n\nHowever, if the HOA did sue as you indicate above and the judgment lien was recorded, then the judgment lien is avoidable under 11 U.S.C. 522(f) as long it impairs your homestead exemption. Some people mistakenly believe that you cannot avoid a lien if you have no equity (and therefore no interest to exempt) in your home. But that's not true. Your exemption is impaired to the extent that all liens, plus your available homestead exemption (whether used or not) exceed the fair market value of the home. Again, if you wish to explore this option, you would do best to consult an experienced bankruptcy attorney in your area.\n\nGood luck!",
        "Consult with an attorney in whom you have confidence. There are several ways of avoiding liens, but the outcome will vary based upon several factors and facts, such as whether the lien arises by statute or by judgment, by when the lien was obtained, by what Chapter of the Bankruptcy Code you file your case, and by what is permitted in the jurisdiction in which your Bankruptcy Court is located. For example:\n11 U.S.C. Sec. 547 -- preferential transfer: would permit avoidance/cancellation of a lien -- judicial or statutory -- obtained within less than or on 90 days prior to the date on which your bankruptcy case is filed, regardless of which Chapter (but in Chapter 7 the right to bring this action belongs initially to the Chapter 7 trustee.

Sec. 522(f) -- impairment of an exemption: would permit avoidance/cancellation of a judicial lien to the extent it impairs a claimed (or allowed to be claimed) exemption (but this Section pertains only to a lien arising by a judgment, and generally an HOA lien is a statutory lien which arises by statute),\n11 U.S.C. Sec. 506(a) and (d) -- determination of extent of the lien: would permit avoidance/ cancellation of a statutory or a judicial lien if the value of the property is less than the amount(s) owed on liens which already existed at the time the HOA obtained its lien (so if the real property had a value of $100,000.00 but the mortgage balance was $105,000..00 then there would not be any equity to which the HOA lien would attach, and the lien could be avoided and the debt treated as unsecured) -- but generally this is not permitted in Chapter 7 (Supreme Court's Dewsnup v.

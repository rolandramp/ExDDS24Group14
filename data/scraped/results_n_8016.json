        "Unfortunately, the Bankruptcy Code, specifically 11 U.S.C. ยง523(a), mentions that any losses related to DUI, or DUI fines, are not dischargeable debt. So, a bankruptcy court can't discharge those fines, either to the court, or to a victim of a DUI, if they were at all related to a DUI. As a tip, a credit card debt used to pay off the court fines of a DUI that are more than 90 days old, could be dischargeable. Just saying. Hope that helps.",
        "The issue of injury or death arising from the DUI is irrelevant when it comes to the dischargeability of the debt. The short answer to your question is: no, your DUI fines are not dischargeable debt in bankruptcy.\n\nThe longer answer is that this type of debt to the government (e.g. court fines and fees, and this also applies to most taxes, etc.) can only rarely be discharged. By now, if you haven't paid the fines, the County likely forwarded the debt to the state franchise tax board for collection. The State can obtain a judgement against you and can withhold from your paycheck, tax refund, etc. even if you used a bankruptcy to discharge other debts.\n\nPay what you can and take care of it the old fashioned way. Good luck.",
        "No, DUI fines are not dischargeable debt.\n\nFines, penalties and other sanctions that arise from a DUI-related incident are not dischargeable in bankruptcy. This includes sanctions for drunk driving, driving while intoxicated and driving under the influence.\n\nIn addition, court orders from the DUI matter that result in debts such as restitution costs, court costs and traffic school fees cannot be discharged in bankruptcy.",
        "Generally, fines owed to a government entity are not going to be dischargeable. So no, you will not be able to list your DUI fines as dischargeable debt."

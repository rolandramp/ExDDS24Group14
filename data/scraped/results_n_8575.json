    "title": "Overdrawn checking account-Stay violation?",
    "question": "We filed CH7 PRO SE in late August. We included an overdrawn checking account in our filing. We are aware that during the automatic stay imposed by the filing creditors may not seek to collect from us, hence no online account access to credit cards, no statements, etc. However, because we included this checking account and because it is overdrawn, it became a creditor. So how does the law regard the bank sending me statements and continuing online account access of an overdrawn bank account during an active CH7 filing. Is it a violation of stay or does the legal requirement that banks must send account statements override the stay?",

        "They have to send you the statements. Sending the information on the account, which is not necessarily closed by the BK, is a requirement that dos not violate the stay in most jurisdictions. If they do not sue or send letters stating you owe theem the money then it is not a violation. They my also offset the amount owed by taking funds out of other accounts. Speak to an attorney about the decisions are practices of your bankruptcy judge.",
        "Actually is great that they are sending you statements and allowing online access. It is a pain when banks stop sending mortgage statements to clients or stop online access or stop telephone mortgage payments. So long as they don't ask for payment of the debt it is not a violation of the automatic stay. They are probably afraid to do anything not routine while the automatic stay is in effect. By the way, the bank would probably love to stop sending you statements. You can make that request online.",

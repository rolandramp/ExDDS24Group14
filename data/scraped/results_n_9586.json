        "A legal separation, just like a divorce, is a process. At the end of the separation process you have divided all the assets and debts, gotten custody orders and support orders, just like with a divorce. The ONLY difference is that your judgment of legal separation does not free you to remarry as a judgment of dissolution (divorce) would.\n\nSince community property and debt end at separation (NOT upon judgment of legal separation...those are two different things) but a cause of action (the third party's right to sue) occurred before separation, depending on what type of work-related lawsuit it is, a judgment of legal separation OR dissolution may or may not protect you from liability."

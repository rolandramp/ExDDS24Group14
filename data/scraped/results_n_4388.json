Wondering if I can file bankruptcy or is there something else I should do",

        "Bankruptcy is an extreme decision. For what amount is the judgment? If it is a significant amount, you should hire an attorney to refile the motion. This could cost less than a bankruptcy.",
        "Bankruptcy may be an option. I suggest you consult local bankruptcy counsel. The information you received from the self-help center was incorrect. The maximum period of time to move to set-aside a default or default judgment is \"reasonable\" time as determined by the judge who heard your case. Six months is the outside limit when the motion is based upon mistake, surprise, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.",
        "If your debts are unmanageable, it would benefit you to confer with an experienced local bankruptcy attorney to review your financial situation, because most judgments are dischargeable, if you qualify to file.\nFor example, if an unsecured creditor obtains a judgment, it generally does not provide the creditor any better claim in bankruptcy, so you can stop collections whenever you file.",
        "You could appeal the ruling denying 473 relief but doesn't sound like you have appealable issues of law. Or motion for reconsideration depending on grounds. (And also whether there is statement of decision or hearing transcript to determine basis for ruling and evidence)\n\nAlso not clear $ amount if judgement and not clear if judgement is collectible? Assets? Age? Etc.\n\nIf amount is significant and have assets immediately seek consultation of bankruptcy attorney to see if you qualify to file for 7 and appeal attorney to get opinion on grounds or appeal if any.\n\nIf judgment falls within certain un dischargeable debts (fraud, DUI , family support,etc) you will have challenges.\n\nEven if no assets still should seek bankruptcy attorney to review your case (future earnings, inheritance , awards or judgements ) to best advise you.\n\nGood luck.",
        "Unless the judgment is related to fraud, yes, it should be dischargable in bankruptcy. However, consult with an attorney who specializes in bankruptcy to confirm."

    "question": "Can I be held accountable for my late fathers high credit card debt? I was sent a letter by the company offering an 80% reduction of the balance if paid off immediately. My question is if I do pay the offered payment, can the credit card later come back for the full amount? And does the letter serve as a contractual agreement?",
    "answers": [
        "Were you on the credit card along with your father? If not, this is not your personal liability. Was his estate handled through probate? If so, talk with a probate attorney. If you do decide for some reason to settle the debt, or if you were a co-signer on the credit card, there are other questions that need answers: Is the original creditor contacting you or a collection agency? If not original creditor, require written proof that the account has been sold to or assigned to the collection agency. Any settlement needs to be in writing, identifying specific terms of the settlement.",

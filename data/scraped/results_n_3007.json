    "title": "What exactly happens in a bankruptcy 13 buyout if given a choice if you get a chance to refinance through FHA?",
    "question": "When we filed bk13 the house has no equity. Paid the trustee for 2 years while in BK 13 plan but not yet confirmed. after 2 years the House has enough equity I think now if it is a matter of completing the bk plan with regards to paying the trustee? However, not enough equity if you would include the HELOC, but under our bk13 plan the HEloc is considered under lien stripping, like I said house has enough equity now but not enough still to cover the HELOC. What exactly gets paid through bk 13 buyout does it only concern the trustee bk13 plan or will it also include all debts like the heloc? Do FHA accept refinancing without including the HELOC? And has bk13 buyout been done in CA or only in other states? When is the best time to request for the bk13 buyout from the judge,before dismissal?",

        "Main Street Lending specialized in Ch13 Refis until 2007. The market for these loans is beginning to return but is limited to FHA. FHA allows refis out of Ch13 assuming 12 months of trustee and mortgage payments in addition to other requirements such as equity, credit score and LTV. FHA allows subordination of seconds up to 125% under the streamline program-this assumes you already have an FHA loan.\n\nYou must have a confirmed plan. You must have obtained an order avoiding the second. If you want to refi out of BK before 3 years, you will be required to pay 100% to the unsecured creditors (including the HELOC such that lien avoidance becomes unnecessary). For plans beyond 3 years...you run into the title insurance issue of not yet having a discharge and therefore not yet having a voided HELOC, It is an underwriting nightmare. Not easy. You can test the proposition by asking the court to shorten the plan to 3 years. This is easier if there is a hardship.\n\nLastly, attempting to settle with the HELOC directly could be an option...although often difficult while a BK is pending.",
        "I have to agree that you have a complicated fact pattern with interactive variables. You need to sit with an experienced bankruptcy attorney to sort out your options. If possible, it is rare to simply dismiss a case after 2 years. Do you know if you can obtain refinancing? Only if you have commitment in writing can you count on a proposal from a lender. Good Luck.",
        "Your situation has multiple complications and implications. These issues require a detailed analysis of your case. I would consult competent counsel.",
        "The lien isn't stripped until your chapter 13 is discharged. Your idea is a non-starter. Also, unless you are below median income, you cannot buy out for the plan balance, you would have to buy out for the balance on all claims. If the plan hasn't even been confirmed there is nothing to buy out because you don't have an approved plan.\n\nGet with your attorney, if you don't have one get one now, sounds like this case went sideways from the beginning. In my area, at least, few judges would tolerate a chapter 13 Goin for 2 years without a confirmed plan."

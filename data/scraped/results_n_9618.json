        "Matt is right that you can legally buy the car but the real question is if you will be able to keep it and avoid having a creditor take it away so it can be sold and th eproceeds applied to your debt with them. The law is different in each state when it comes to creditors rights and debtors rights and allowable collection enforcement, so you should talk to a lawyer near you in your state. Call your local attorney bar association and ask for a referral to a debtor attorney who handles your kind of dispute. Be sure you know what to do before you buy the car."

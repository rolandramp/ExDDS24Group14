    "question": "I have a judgement for $50,000 awarded to my ex wife for half of the family business. It was valued at $100,000 based on bank statements from 2006/2007. It is worth nothing now, basically the value of my tools (about $500) My question is, can this be included in a chapter 13 bankfuptcy or will I still have to pay her the whole amount?",

        "You cannot discharge a property settlement that a family court ordered you to pay as part of a divorce settlement or a divorce decree in Chapter 7 bankruptcy. This is the type of bankruptcy that lets you discharge your debts, with certain exceptions listed in 11 U.S.C. §523 (Exceptions to discharge). One of these exceptions is an obligation to a former spouse, other than alimony or child support, “that is incurred by the debtor in the course of a divorce or separation or in connection with a separation agreement, divorce decree or other order of a court …” Thus, when the debtor spouse files Chapter 7 bankruptcy, the bankruptcy court does not need to distinguish between alimony, child support, and equitable distribution payments. Neither is dischargeable in Chapter 7.\n\nThe same applies to money judgments related to property settlement. If you did not comply with the terms of equitable distribution in the divorce settlement agreement, your former spouse may obtain a money judgment against you. Even though money judgments are almost always dischargeable in bankruptcy, regardless of the facts that led to the lawsuit, the same exception to discharge applies to money judgments relating to property settlement — they are not dischargeable in Chapter 7.\n\nThere are certain debts that debtors cannot discharge in Chapter 7, but which may be discharged in Chapter 13. Equitable distribution payments are one of those debts. The very same money judgment, for example, which was not dischargeable in Chapter 7, may be dischargeable in Chapter 13. Let’s say your former spouse obtained the money judgment for non-payment of equitable distribution and recorded a judgment lien certificate against exempt property to make the judgment secured. You may be able to file a motion with the bankruptcy court, called Motion to Avoid a Lien, and request a removal of the lien. If the bankruptcy court grants the motion, the lien is removed (or in bankruptcy jargon “stripped”). The debt is not, however, wiped out immediately. It becomes unsecured, and is treated on par with other unsecured debts of the debtor. This means that your Chapter 13 plan has to provide for payments of that unsecured debt. The payment amount will depend on the value of your non-exempt assets and on your income. If you successfully complete the plan, the judgment will be discharged, together with other unsecured debts.\n\nConsult a bankruptcy attorney.\n\nBest of luck to you.\n\nThis response is intended to be a general statement of law, should not be relied upon as legal advice, does not create an attorney/client relationship and does not create a right to continuing email exchanges.",
        "It appears to me that your wife is an unsecured creditor. When you say a judgment, do you mean you had a property settlement? As long as your debt is characterized as a property settlement and not an obligation for child support or spousal maintenance, I think you can list this debt as a general unsecured debt, and eventually, when you complete your Chapter 13 plan, it should be discharged. Your wife also has to file a Proof of Claim. If she does not file, she cannot get paid. Of course, it depends on a type of plan you will propose, some Chapter 13 plans pay nothing to general unsecured creditors, some pay a portion (and some pay 100% of claims). If she files an improper proof of claim, you can object to it. Your lawyer will assist you.",

It is only dischargeable in a Chapter 13 case if you complete the plan payments.\n\nTalk to a local attorney for more information.\n\n[This communication is intended as general information and not specific legal advice, and this communication does not create an attorney-client relationship.]"

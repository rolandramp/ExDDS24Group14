        "In the first link, below, I have sample letters that you can send by Certified Mail, return receipt requested to dispute a debt collector's debt. See letter 1.1. Keep a copy of everything. The collector must respond or cease all collection activity until they have responded in writing. Either the debt collector owns the debt or is collecting for BofA, under the name Countrywide.\n\nAlso, be aware if it has been more than four years since you last paid this loan, the debt would no longer be legally enforceable in court, because of the statute of limitations having expired, so you would not be obligated to pay it. Only a review of your loan documents and understanding of the relevant facts can give an opinion on this, but I wanted to warn you in case the four year period is close to expiring. If you pay it before the period expires and before they file a lawsuit, then your payment renews the four year period from date of payment.",
        "Yes, as the above answer points out, a \"debt buyer\" can (and does) buy paper in default and subsequently engages in debt collection activity. You can require that the debt collector validate the debt under the FDCPA and can raise affirmative defenses to standing if a lawsuit is filed.\n\nYou may also send them a cease and desist letter requiring that debt collection, both calls and written letters, stop. If you have more questions or want to review the FDCPA and your rights thereunder, feel free to visit our website: www.ConsumerRightsGroup.com\n\nDISCLAIMER: This is not an attempt to establish an attorney-client relationship. I am not a licensed attorney in the State of California and as such this is not an attempt to practice law in that state.",
        "First of all, Countrywide was bought by Bank of America. The contracts that Countrywide had could still be valid. This means that either the collection agency is a contractor for Bank of America now OR the collection agency allegedly bought the debt.\n\nDemand something in writing from the collection agency. You have rights under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. Among those rights is the right to demand proof that this company owns the debt or otherwise has the right to collect it. You also have the right to stop them from calling you. Do everything in writing and seek a consultation from an attorney knowledgeable in the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act.",
        "Easy... the collection agency bought the debt and now are the rightful owners of the debt... which means the agency can attempt to collect and pursue you.\n\nDepending on how much they are attempting to collect you will need to seek counsel to either defend you in what will be an upcoming lawsuit or prepare you for a strategic bankruptcy filing to wipe out that debt.\n\nFeel free to contact me for a free consultation so you can have some further clarity to these issues.\n\nAlso, please follow me on twitter and my blog to learn more about these issues and their solutions."

    "title": "A company assigned by SSA to pay my bills.",
    "question": "I have an organization assigned by SSA to pay my bills every month. What could I do if they pay my bills late, not put funds on my debt card for personal spending, not pay my electric bill for 5 months, no correspondence about my questions. Is this called misuse of funds? I pay them monthly for the service. I added up all the late fees I have had to pay because of the bill being paid late which totals up to $3,000 plus. Is there anything I can do besides getting another payee or payor (whichever) they are called. I am in the process of hiring a different one as we speak. Please let me know what kind of action if any I have. Thank you very much. Teri",

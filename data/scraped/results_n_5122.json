    "title": "\"default\" granted, now onto judgment. How long does that las part take in the Santa Clara Courthouse in San Jose?",
    "question": "Amicable divorce (w/minors and w/property), filed all paperwork (including a request for default and the signed MSA and the request for judgment) in early March. We have just found out that the \"default\" was granted last week. We have a scheduled status conference (the default one they schedule) in June, which we have already continued once (it used to be in May). So the question is two-fold: (1) How long does it normally take in Santa Clara Court for this last \"leg\" of the process (the judgment); and (2) what exactly does the judgment clerk do with our filing? What type of review is this?",

        "You might try checking the status of your case by going to the Santa Clara County Clerk website. You can obtain case information on line there. In any event I know from experience with some of my clients that it can take a couple of months from when the Judgment clerk obtains the packet, for them to review it, forward it to the Judge for his/her signature and then return it to you. As to the question about your MSA, it is unusual for a court to modify it. Assuming that the support provisions are reasonable and contain the necessary information the Judge probably not do anything about the MSA other than approve it.",
        "You have to submit a judgment packet. Use form FL-182 Judgment Checklist as a reference, to get it right. (Submit it, too.)\n\nAssuming that you've complied with the checklist, the wait my be two months or so. Sometimes they come back with comments on what is missing or needs to be changed/corrected.\n\nYou'll have to check to baskets at the clerk's office on a semi-regular basis, to see if your packet's there.",
        "My understanding is that a judgment packet takes 8 weeks to process in Santa Clara county, unless you are close to the end of the year and then there may be a cut off time for receiving your judgment by end of year. But i think it is about 8 weeks.",
        "I spoke to the court specialist last week and found out that they were still processing judgements from mid-February. You probably have to wait at least another 2 months before you receive papers but you can call the court and leave a message with the judgment clerk to find a better time estimate.",
        "As far as the Santa Clara courthouse issue, that will need to be asked of them. I am not familiar with that courthouse's time frame and constraints. Usually it takes 8-10 weeks in LA for them to process a judgment package but I don't know if the Petitioner will be required to havea default prove-up hearing or if a stipulation for judgment can be agreed to by the parties, signed by teh parties with the defaulting party haveing their signature notarized. A Judgment clerk will review the submitted judgment package, if it has been done and filed with the court, and the judgmetn clerk will approve it as to its form and correctness and then submit it to a judge for approval and signture. If you have a judgment hearing, it will be in front of a judicial officer, not a judgment clerk, and the judicial officer will jsut want to know the status of the case and will want to know if a judgment package has been submitted to the clerk for processing. If not, the judicial officer will inquire as to why it hasn't been submitted. If the parties do not convince the reviewing judicial officer that they can complete the task the court will then schedule a trial date to complete the divorce and enter judgment on the status of the marriage and divide any assets and debts and make orders on any support issues and custody issues."

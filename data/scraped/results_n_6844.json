        "Once a retirement plan has been \"Joined\" as a party in a divorce action, they should be willing to release information to you, without ex's consent, so that a QDRO can be prepared. Your post is not clear, but it sounds like the pension plan has not yet been joined. Employers become very cooperative with providing information once they are joined and given notice of a spouse's adverse interest and a pending divorce. As far as your ex providing information regarding his pension and retirement accounts, this would/should have been provided early in your divorce action in his declaration of disclosure (Schedule of Assets and Debts). Once you have the name and account number for his pension, you should be able to serve/file your joinder(s). A quick search on the internet will give you contact information for the plan administrator so you can ask questions about how/where to send the joinder.\n\nI would start by contacting your counsel who represented you in the divorce. Otherwise, QDROs can be quite complicated and not something one should handle on their own. If your former counsel will not help you, will need new family law counsel or \"QDRO Counsel\".",
        "I am a little confused by your post. If you received a QDRO (for other readers, that's \"Qualified Domestic Relations Order,\" essentially a court order that divvies up benefits upon dissolution of marriage), you should not need any release from your ex-husband to receive the benefits. You already have a court order for that.\n\nIf this issue is about determinin what benefits he is receiving, I would have expected your divorce attorney to discover that information during the dissolution proceedings. I am not sure what you mean when you say this was \"left a pending issue\" when the decree was issued, as that makes it sound like you did not yet receive a QDRO.\n\nYou should consult with a divorce attorney about this to figure out where you are procedurally, preferably the one that already represented you in the underlying divorce proceedings. If you don't have the QDRO yet, you should probably attempt to reopen the divorce proceedings to obtain one. Similarly, you should seek to depose your ex-husband and subpoena his benefit information in the process. You could also subpoena the \"person most knowledgeable\" about your husband's benefits from the benefit fund administrator. You have to be in active court proceedings to have that subpoena power, though.\n\nIf you already have the QDRO, you should serve it (certified mail) on your ex-husband's benefit fund or employer, depending on who is administering the benefits. For example, if your husband was a Teamster, the employer does not administer his pension benefits, the Teamsters Health and Retirement Fund (or whatever name it goes under these days) would. Technically, this is an ERISA-governed fund and is a separate entity comprised half of employer representatives and half of Union representatives. When they receive a QDRO, they are legally obligated to divvy up the benefits accordingly, regardless of the employer's or ex-husband's consent.\n\nIf the QDRO issued and required your husband to disclose the benefits at a later date, and your husband is violating that Court order, I would petition the Court for enforcement of the Order and contempt sanctions against the ex-husband.\n\nGood luck to you,"

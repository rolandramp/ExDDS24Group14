        "I agree with my colleagues - it all depends upon the type of lien and also relates to the type of bankruptcy case that you might be eligible to file. Seek out a certified specialist in bankruptcy law or an attorney that primarily practices in the area of bankruptcy and is familiar regarding the options for avoiding liens.",
        "With a \"lien remover\". Ok..Just kidding!! It depends on the type of debt and value of property and your exemptions and other facts. You simply need to sit down with an experienced Bankruptcy Attorney to discuss your situation. Its free to do so with almost all Bankruptcy Attorneys. But other facts and issues can affect your case if you have not filed it yet so I will point those out too. But if already filed, meet with an attorney and bring your filed schedules to discuss with them.\n\nYou need and want to enjoy your fresh start also. But the most important thing is to meet with an attorney as you asking this question means you have not. You care about 2 goals: keeping everything you have equity in and discharging all your debts. If you don't have any of the exceptions to discharge you will obtain that goal; most exceptions are set forth in 11 USC. 523 (Google it) like child support, some income taxes, traffic (in a ch 7) and criminal fines , and presumption of student loans. But some debts are dischargeable in a ch 13 but NOT in a ch 7 so you want to make sure and your attorney will discuss any such types with you also!\n\nYour exemptions depend on what state you have lived in in the last 2 years and thus if in your state, then your states exemptions will apply. Most persons filing keep everything they own but your attorney will confirm that with you when they learn everything you own and the equity thereof!\n\nSome secured debts like homes, vehicles, other secured debts an attorney will discuss your options on also as you must list any debts; but that does not mean you will lose them unless you have too much equity or are in default on paying for them! Discuss those options if they apply with your attorney too.\n\nBut other issues can arise that can greatly harm your case. Just one example: If you paid back a relative $3,000 11 months ago and now file bankruptcy next week, the trustee can SUE that relative to retrieve that $3,000 (under what is called a preference) for the benefit of the bankruptcy estate. As a result, most attorneys don't charge to meet with them the first meeting so meet with one no matter what.\n\nMany great attorneys can be found right here on AVVO in your state so look, call, and meet one as soon as you can.\n\nYou should also want to know when to file: is there an advantage of waiting versus filing now and who should you pay between now and then! Good luck and enjoy your later fresh start.",
        "Would have helped to have specified what kind of liens you have. For example, a municipal lien for trash, sewer, or taxes? A state or federal tax lien? A court judgment lien? When was the lien placed on the property?You don't have to post multiple times to get an answer but you would help yourself get an accurate answer by providing some detail. Hope this perspective helps!"

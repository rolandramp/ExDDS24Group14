        "In my experience this is not required. Moreover, section 362(d)(1) says the court is required to terminate, modify, or condition the automatic stay \"for cause, including the lack of adequate protection of an interest in property\" of the party requesting relief. With that said, not only would you have to file a motion but you would also have to follow any local rules and requirements accompanying your papers. I suggest you seek out a local bankruptcy attorney. There are many in your area that would be willing to assist you.",
        "No, there is no requirement to meet and confer. There is no requirement to send any notice to the debtor or debtor's counsel prior to filing the motion to lift the automatic stay. If the debtor is in default of the chapter 13 plan in the payments that are required to pay the claim that you hold, then a motion to lift may be your best option. You really should meet with an experienced bankruptcy attorney that represents creditors in bankruptcy regularly and get some advice based upon your needs and based upon the status of the debtor's bankruptcy and the relation to your loan or claim. You can search for an attorney by using the Avvo \"Find a Lawyer\" link at the top of this page.",
        "In my experience, it is not necessary to meet and confer prior to bringing a motion for Relief of Stay. If you are contemplating representing yourself w/o a lawyer, think again.

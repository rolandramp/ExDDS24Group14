    "answers": [
        "There is no requirement that a creditor reports to the credit bureaus. In my experience, bail bonds typically are not reported to the credit bureaus and, as result of not being reported, do not affect your FICO score(s) and credit worthiness. However, having a debt not show up on your credit does not mean the creditor will simply go away. If the paperwork was properly drawn up and signed, and if you do not have a valid defense, the bail bondsman can pursue collections, including phone calls, lawsuits, and even wage garnishments.",
        "It isn't clear that bail bond companies regularly report to the credit reporting agencies. It is possible, but if sent to collections it wouldn't necessarily indicate that it came from a bail bond debt.",
        "Yes. Bail bond company may report default on bond payments on your credit record.\nBond default may be discharged in C7 BK.",
        "Remember, BK is more than checking boxes on forms you find online. Find/consult/hire a lawyer using the Avvo feature \"Find a Lawyer\".

        "That is the least of your problems. Depending on your overall financial situation, Bankruptcy may be right for you. An experienced CA Bankruptcy attorney will be able to determine which type of Bankruptcy, if any is the correct one for you. Use AVVO's Find a Lawyer tool to select a qualified attorney. Good luck. THIS IS NOT LEGAL ADVICE! YOU NEED TO SPEAK TO AN ATTORNEY WHO IS LICENSED IN YOUR STATE FOR LEGAL ADVICE. This is merely suggestions for you to think about in discussing your situation with the local attorney.",
        "That will depend on if the bail bond company reports it as being unpaid. You may want to speak with them to arrange for payments."

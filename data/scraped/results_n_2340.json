        "Generally, you can always propose to settle a debt for less than the stated balance. But collection agencies represent the creditor and are not a debtor's \"friend\". Several variables may help you negotiate a lesser amount than owed. Time. The older the debt, the less likely it is for a collector to obtain the full amount. Need. If you let the collector know that you 'need' to pay off the debt in order to secure a loan, or in your case, a license, the less likely they will compromise. Finally, make sure the debt is valid, and that it isn't so old that the collector can't pursue a legal action against you. Seek competent counsel if you continue to have problems.",
        "They are often willing to negotiate with people.",
        "I agree with Mr. Fenn. The relatively low amount means they are not likely to grant a large discount for a lump sum settlement. Payments will be for the full amount, no discount. Frame your offer based on your resources and income, make it about the economics. End of the month is a good time to offer, the collector needs to make their quota to get their monthly bonus.",
        "Collectors are often willing to negotiate with debtors. If you are hoping to work out a payment plan AND a reduction in the debt, you may have a hard time with a debt as small as $800. If you have a lump sum ($400-500?), they may be willing to settle with you. The collection agency may choose to dig in its heels and demand not a dollar less than the $800, and they are certainly within their rights to do so.\n\nIt certainly can't hurt to try."

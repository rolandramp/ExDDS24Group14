    "title": "I owe $23,000 in back child support. I recently finished college and got a job. Is there a way to pay without being garnished?",
    "question": "I live in California. I struggled to make it through college living off of student loans. I had an order to pay $20 per month but wasn't able to pay in the last year. I finally have a career and want to pay my arrears but I really don't want to be garnished 50% of my income due to other debts (rent, student loans, etc). I am determined to pay this debt off completely within 5 years and want to know how to go about setting up a payment arrangement with the Child support agency. My goal is to be able to make reasonable payments that will allow me to still survive. I have no current child support order. I only owe arrears. I also will be paying money to my child's mother. Thank you in advance.",

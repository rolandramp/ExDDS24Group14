        "The fact of his illegal immigration status is irrelevant for purposes of property division. As a practical matter he may never enforce his rights. However, if the two of you have been physically separated, which requires not just that you be physically separated but also that you one or both of you have decided to end the marriage, then whatever you acquire after that separation is your own separate property and he would then have no rights to that property.",
        "Your husband's legal status has little to do with California community property law. His incarceration and potential deportation will make it quite difficult for his to assert his rights, but if you purchased property with community property funds, i.e. monies earned by either of you during the marriage, then yes, he has rights to the property. You should consult a Temecula family law attorney as soon as possible.\n\nDisclaimer: The preceding is not intended as legal advice and does not create an attorney cleint relationship",
        "This is more a family law question than an immigration question. As far as I know (In CA) his legal presence does not affect his community property rights. However, if you were separated an argument can be made. I will recommend speaking to a good family law lawyer.\n\nGood Luck\nShah Peerally\nFounder and Managing Attorney of Shah Peerally Law Group PC\nThe Law Firm Deals in Immigration law & Debt Relief\nNote: The above answer is provided for informational use only.

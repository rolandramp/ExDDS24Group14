    "title": "Is the reclaiming of H1B bound by time frame? I.e. is it necessary to reclaim within a year?",
    "question": "I was in US for a year on H1B (Feb 2004-Feb2005). I visited US again in 2009 on Dependent (H4). Would it be possible to reclaim the 5 years on the previous H1 without being subject to the cap?",

        "Actually, I have a different view to the last 2 posters. Assuming that you were outside the US for one full year since you held H-1B status, I believe that you have the choice of (a) reclaiming the reminder of your H-1B time; or (b) restarting the 6-years and being subject to the cap. There is a memo from Michael Aytes, CIS, dated 12/5/06 that specifically addresses this scenario.",
        "Mr. Reich is correct. If an employee is out of the U.S. for a year, they must re-apply for an H1-b. This means that time on an expired H1-b1 cannot be reclaimed.",
        "Not exactly, though it doesn't sound like you will be able to reclaim unused time in your case.\n\nH-1B time re-sets once you have spent a full year overseas (our of the U.S.) Since you have apparently been out of the U.S. for over a year, you will need to go through the H-1B lottery again for a new six-year H-1B period.\n\nHowever, had you been here for the five years since February 2005 in some other status, you WOULD gave been able to go back to H-1B status for the remaining five years even though fivee years had passed, because you had not left for a year.\n\nIt isn't only the time, it is where you spend the time.",
        "No you can always reclaim the 5 years. If you want to reclaim fresh then you have to be outside for one year.\n\nGood Luck\nShah Peerally\nFounder and Managing Attorney of Shah Peerally Law Group PC\nLaw Firm Deals in Immigration law, Bankruptcy & Debt Relief\nhttp://peerallylaw.com\n37600 Central Ct, Ste 201, Newark CA 94560\n510.742.5887\ninfo@peerallylaw.com\n\nNote: The above answer is provided for informational use only.

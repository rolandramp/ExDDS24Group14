    "answers": [
        "His filing bankruptcy should not affect your mortgage. Filing bankruptcy will discharge his personal liability which means he is no longer responsible for the mortgage loan. You will be on only one liable for the loan. Once his personal liability is discharged, you might want to request that the loan be put in your name only. If bank is unwilling to do that, consider refinancing when you have the ability to do so. The loan will then be in your name only.",
        "I agree with Attorney Rausa. The bankruptcy will eliminate your husband's personal liability on the mortgage, but you will remain liable, and the lender will look to you for payments. Your divorce settlement agreement may have an impact on this. Review it with your divorce attorney.",
        "If he does file bankruptcy, the mortgage company is nor really going to care so long as the payments are made by someone when they become due. I am sure that the divorce granted you the home, so you may want to take a look at the final decree or speak with your divorce attorney.\nIf you get notice of him filing a bk, then consult with a bk attoney."

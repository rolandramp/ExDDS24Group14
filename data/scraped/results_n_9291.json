        "This is an interesting question that we get all the time from Indian nationals because the equivalent of a bachelor is 4 years degree in the US and in India it is usually 3 years. What can be done in this case is to use the experience. Usually 3 years experience is equivalent to 1 academic year. Based on this logic, since you have 10 years of experience, the credential evaluators will be able to use three years to add to the 3 academic years to make fourth year. In our office, we have successfully been able to combine all the academic years for H1B in situation where there was only one academic year was available to get the full four years. However, you will need a strong H1B petition when the academic years are missing. I will recommend talking to a good immigration lawyer familiar with H1B to help.\n\nGood Luck\nShah Peerally\n\nFounder and Managing Attorney of Shah Peerally Law Group PC\nLaw Firm Deals in Immigration law, Bankruptcy & Debt Relief\n\n\nNote: The above answer is provided for informational use only.

        "Possibly. Your degree and transcripts, along with documentation of at least three years of your prior experience, would be sent to a professional credentials evaluator.\n\nUSCIS deems three years of work experience to be the equivalent of one year of baccalaureate-level education, and so the combination may be deemed the equivalent of a U.S. bachelor's degree in a specific field and so usable for purposes of qualifying you for an H-1B visa in that field.\n\nTher ewould still be a problem for using this in a later permanent residence case, though.\n\nSpeak with an immigration attorney for specifics."

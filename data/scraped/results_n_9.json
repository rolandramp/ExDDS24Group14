        "Do you have an attorney helping you? If not, you should hire an experienced bankruptcy attorney to assist you with this and any forms that need to be amended. Special bankruptcy rules can be invoked if one receives an inheritance post bankruptcy filing. Was this truly a gift? Why did your friend give you $50,000? Did you loan him/her from before and they owed it to you? I would consult with an attorney on this if you do not already have one.",
        "Responses have already addressed the issue: If you knew about the \"gift\" prior to filing the bankruptcy, it should have been disclosed as a \"possible\" asset and properly protected by an exemption if available. And, when did you find out about in conjunction with your bankruptcy case? I urge you to talk directly with an experienced bankruptcy attorney to discuss further.",
        "I agree with my colleagues. In addition, if you were expecting the cash gift prior to filing your bankruptcy petition, you would have had a duty to disclose this cash gift in your petition.\n\nBe sure to speak to a knowledgeable California attorney.",
        "As you can see from prior answers, the answer is NO..not required to disclose a gift received after filing bankruptcy and assuming you were NOT entitled to it as it was not already agreed to be received even if not until after you file. Thus, you want it all to occur post filing. If the payment ends up on bank accounts and trustee sees it, they may ask the source and just answer:..it was a gift from so and so of $x . Thus, dont lie. Discuss with your attorney if you have one first on all these answers. Thanks for asking too.",
        "There's no harm in disclosing it. If it's not part of your bankruptcy estate, your Trustee will have no interest in it. If it is, it will be used to pay your unsecured creditors and you will keep the rest.\nWhether it is, or not, is a question which will depend on when the lottery ticked was purchased, when the lottery was held, your status as a beneficiary of the relative's will/trust, etc...",
        "Depends when you received the gift. If it was received before you filed your bankruptcy case, then yes it must be disclosed, both on the means test form, and of course on your personal property schedules.\n\nIf the gift was received after your case was filed, then it technically does not need to be disclosed, but depending on when you receive it, it may be a good idea to inform the Trustee.

        "Depends on how soon the gift happens after someone files.

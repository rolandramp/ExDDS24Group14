        "I respectfully agree and disagree with my colleagues. First, this is not an attempt to collect a debt, so I don't think it violates the bankruptcy law. However, I do believe you still have a claim. This is certainly at a minimum a violation of common law privacy. As for damages, which my colleagues seem to be referring to wit their \"without more\" language, your credit score is affected anytime somebody pulls your credit. Your interest rates may be increased, you may be denied credit. You may have credit limits reduced. There are damages. The real issue is how much you want to spend on such a case, because you would need an expert to opine about those damages. And that can get costly.",
        "I do not think that pulling a credit report, without more, is an attempt to collect a debt. You have been discharged and do not have to pay the mortgage.",
        "In some ways, your question is more a state law question than bankruptcy law. It doesn't appear that the act of pulling your credit report is an attempt to collect a debt, so it's doubtful you would prevail on a lawsuit for injunction or damages. Even more, the statement that \"a credit report in no way assists with enforcing in rem rights\" begs for an answer such as \"creditor wants to see if debtor is racking up significant post-discharge debts that would impair debtor's ability to repay mortgage.\" If that's the case then it's possible under state law that BofA could claim there was additional grounds for declaring a default.",
        "A discharge violation requires an attempt by the creditor to collect. It isn't clear to me that pulling your credit report constitutes any effort to attempt to collect. It has been my experience that while these sorts of actions can sound good on paper, as a practical matter, unless a debtor has sustained serious damages, the court will not award damages, even if there is some sort of violation. Hope this perspective helps!",
        "First, B of A may due that as they may not receive the mail for example. I know of no reason they cant check on anyones credit. Your payments were DISCHARGED in Bankruptcy...and thus there is no payment due so it is zero! However, you can probably obtain later a printout of all payments made and time of payments and provide to all 3 credit reporting bureaus and state to add them as payments made on time as it is true you paid them..and if on time, have it reflect that. But the debt is discharged absent a reaffirmation which is rarely used.but sometimes some attorneys do for some reasons good..(and normally not good reasons I believe and I think you see most attorneys on here never do such reaffirmations). Checking your account is not attempting to collect on a debt..they have NOT asked you to pay anything! Good luck. If you refinance ever, the new loan is post bankruptcy and will be reflected..wait 2 yrs and one day after filing to find a bank for a refinance!"

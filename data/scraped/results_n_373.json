    "title": "Hi I just got a summon from the count of Santa Clara. I am currently being sued by bank of America for debt that was owed?",
    "question": "Long story short, I received a summon and I am being sued by bank of America to the tune of 13,000. I currently do not have a job, nor any asset right now. I had one before, but that was 2 years ago. I have no capability to pay for the current debt. What would be my best option. However I am a cosigner on my my mom car, and my name is 2nd to her account as well. Will she be affected by me. Any help would be helpful. Thank you",

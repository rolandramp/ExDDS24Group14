        "To qualify for Summary Dissolution, you must meet all of the statutory requirements; not just some of them - or all except for one. Because husband owns real estate you do not qualify for summary dissolution. However, if there is no dispute as to the division of this property, no other property, no children, etc. your divorce action can remain simple. If you choose to handle it yourself, please refer to the self help link on the LA Superior Court's web-site for family law: http://www.courts.ca.gov/selfhelp-divorce.htm",
        "One of the requirements of filing a summary dissolution of marriage in CA is that neither party own any community or separate property worth more than $38,000. Even if the house was owned prior to marriage, there may be a community property interest if the loan was paid down during marriage from community funds. If the house is worth more than $38,000, that will likely disqualify you from filing a summary dissolution case.\n\nHowever, if you have an otherwise simple divorce case with some tentative agreements between you in place, it may cost you very little to have an attorney assist you with the necessary paperwork as a standard divorce case.",
        "I do not believe that a summary dissolution is possible because there is real property involved. Even though the property may be H's property, that would mean that the real property must be dispposed of correctly. If there was a lien on the property, then it is possible that there might be some community property interest in the real property as there was also community property income during the marriage. Because of this, then it would be best to hire an attorney to make sure all rights are protected.",
        "It will remain separate property. Wife will be entitled to something back if the community paid money to pay for or improve the separate property.\n\nCalifornia Family Code 770-772 states:\n\n770. (a) Separate property of a married person includes all of the following:\n\n(1) All property owned by the person before marriage.\n\n(2) All property acquired by the person after marriage by gift, bequest, devise, or descent.\n\n(3) The rents, issues, and profits of the property described in this section.\n\n(b) A married person may, without the consent of the person's spouse, convey the person's separate property.\n\n771. (a) The earnings and accumulations of a spouse and the minor children living with, or in the custody of, the spouse, while living separate and apart from the other spouse, are the separate property of the spouse.\n\n(b) Notwithstanding subdivision (a), the earnings and accumulations of an unemancipated minor child related to a contract of a type described in Section 6750 shall remain the sole legal property of the minor child.\n\n772. After entry of a judgment of legal separation of the parties, the earnings or accumulations of each party are the separate property of the party acquiring the earnings or accumulations.\n\n\n\nIn other words, if the property was acquired during the marriage while the parties were domiciled in California, a general presumption applies that the property is community. The presumption can be rebutted by showing by a preponderance of the evidence (i.e., that it is more likely than not) that the property is separate—that is, it was acquired before marriage, while the parties were living separate and apart, or by gift, or is otherwise traceable to a separate property source, or by establishing a contrary agreement or understanding."

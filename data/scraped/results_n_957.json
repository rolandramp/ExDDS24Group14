    "title": "Can I dismiss my case and not be forced to sell my homes? And if I dismiss what happens to my attorney fees?",
    "question": "I am currently under a Chapter 13 bankruptcy. Both of my homes have been taken out of the Bankruptcy due to motions for relief. I was able to save both homes. I voluntarily gave up my vehicle that was protected under the bankruptcy. At this point their is no reason for me to keep the bankruptcy. My financial situation is a lot better and I can now afford to make the payments to my debtors directly. At this point I would like to dismiss my case. I have about $135,000 in equity in one home and $100,000 in another. I filed jointly with my husband.",

        "You definitely need to call me or another attorney that does individual Chapter 11's. Your in the wrong procedure considering you have multiple homes. If you dismiss there will be a 180 day to refiling. If the trustee dismisses there will be no bar. Depending on the judge you can still include the properties in a Ch 11",
        "I'm a bit troubled by your saying that you were \"able to save both homes\". A chapter 13 case requires you to submit all of your disposable income to the trustee for distribution to creditors. So, I'm not certain how you \"saved\" your homes. In any event, a chapter 13 case is a voluntary repayment case and theoretically you can dismiss the case. I would strongly urge you to speak to your attorney about dismissing the case.",
        "Absent an an objection from the Chapter 13 trustee, or any creditor, a dismissal of a Chapter 13 is typically granted. Your local bankruptcy Court may very well have a Voluntary Dismissal Form to be filled out and filed with the Court. The Order Dismissing your case will come within a few days, typically. I am of the opinion it is far better to have a voluntary dismissal of a Chapter 13 case, than a dismissal at the request of the Chapter 13 trustee and Order thereon. I would consult with your attorney.",
        "If I understand the question correctly, the mortgage holders on the two homes have both filed a motion for relief from the automatic stay. If that is happened, you can file a motion to voluntarily dismiss, but once the order is granted dismissing the case, you cannot refile for relief under the bankruptcy code for 180 days after the dismissal. If you are behind on the mortgages, it is very likely that the foreclosures will be completed prior to the expiration of the 180 day prohibition from filing another bankruptcy petition.\n\nYou may have some defense to foreclosure in California, but as I understand, California is a non-judicial foreclosure state, which generally means that the foreclosure can be completed relatively quickly and defense of the foreclosure is more difficult than in the judicial foreclosure states.\n\nIf you fail to pay your plan payments and the court dismisses your case after the trustee files a motion to dismiss, you can file another case and get another shot at making a chapter 13 work, which may be possible considering the fact that your income is greater now.\n\nIf you have an attorney, you need to be reviewing your questions with him/her.

        "You can dismiss your case at any time as long as you don't have extenuating circumstances (such as you abused the bankruptcy court process during your case, had numerous previously filed cases with dismissals, etc.).

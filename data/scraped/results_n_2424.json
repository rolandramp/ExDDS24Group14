    "title": "During CA Probate, can the Homestead Exemption be sought for an adult (non-elderly) disabled child of the decedent?",
    "question": "According to CA probate code 6521, \"The probate homestead shall be set apart for the use of one or more of the following persons: (a) The surviving spouse. (b) The minor children of the decedent.\"",
    "answers": [
        "The probate code is clear but if the spouse is still living, then it meets the first exemption clause. BUT, it sounds like the adult child need a conservator.",
        "It sounds like you really need to sit down with a lawyer to go over the current estate plan of the surviving spouse and how the disabled child is protected now and after the death of the surviving spouse? Or are the no safe guards in place for the disabled child? Is there a special needs trust in place? Perhaps, a transfer of assets to a Special Needs Trust now might make sense. However, there are way too many possible scenarios here to give an answer that you can rely on at this point. It really requires an attorney to walk through this with you or the person who is legally responsible for these two people. And is the surviving spouse competent?",
        "Nope - sorry, it means what it says. Spouse and MINOR children. However the law does not require the party claiming the exemption to live in the property. Depending upon the age and physical condition of the surviving spouse you might consider having the surviving spouse making a claim for the homestead exemption. In any event the court may set a specific time period for the exemption - and in any event it would expire on the death of the surviving spouse."

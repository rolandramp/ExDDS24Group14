    "title": "Can I abandon a suspended CA corporation and leave suspended forever?",
    "question": "I formed a CA corp in 2008. I operated for 6 mos, but ultimately had no income, no outstanding debt and no business that could lead to someone having a reason to bring suit - I also filed no paperwork or tax returns. Eventually forgot all about the corp.... But, I just searched for it on the CA Secretary of State's website and it says \"suspended\". I want to dissolve it but can't afford $800 x 4 yrs in taxes. What will happen if I leave the corporation permanently suspended? Will it continue to accumulate $800/yr forever? Am I personally liable for the taxes? Will I have any trouble forming a new CA corp if I am still listed as an officer and agent of service on this suspended one? I'm a writer and will need to form a \"loanout\" eventually and want to ensure this mistake won't affect that.",

        "What will happen if I leave the corporation permanently suspended?\n\nI believe that the state of California will ultimately revoke the status of the Corporation and it will cease to exist.\n\nWill it continue to accumulate $800 per year forever?\n\nUntil the status of the corporation is permanently revoked, it will continue to accumulate the minimum franchise tax fee of $800.00 per year.\n\nAm I personally liable for the taxes?\n\nAs the other attorneys already explained, in general, you are not personally liable for the taxes of the corporation unless you sign documentation to the contrary. However, if the corporation had any assets that were distributed to the shareholders (you), I believe that the state of California may make a concerted effort to have you disgorge the money that was distributed out of the corporation before all of the debts and obligations to the state were paid.\n\nWill I have any troubles opening a new corporation in California if I'm listed as an officer, director or agent for service of process on the suspended corporation?\n\nYou should have no trouble opening up a new corporation in the state of California even though you are listed as an officer, director and/or resident agent for service of process on the suspended corporation.\n\nI hope that some of these thoughts helped. I know that the other attorneys spent some time thinking about this problem for you and we would all appreciate it if you take the time to mark one of the responses as the “Best Answer\". Good luck.",
        "Actuallly this type of thing happens to clietns pretty frequently. The State of California wll continue to send you bills for the 800 per year and penalities and interest, but if the corporation has no assets and no liabilities other than the State, what will ultimately happen will be that you will not only be suspended but the charter will be revoked.\nYou don't generally have personal liability for these taxes and penalties unless you have personally signed on for them somewhere- but that is very uncommon;\nfurther this issue should not interfere with your starting another corporation etc. I would however stay away from using a similar name;\nHope this helps,\nSteve W",

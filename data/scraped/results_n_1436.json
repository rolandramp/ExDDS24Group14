Much more time is involved in an Adversary than it might appear at first if the job is going to be done adequately. The attorney's fees in an Adversary, depending on complexity of facts, number of witnesses and investigation time needed, plus court proceedings, can easily exceed $15,000.",

If you are uncomfortable with the proposal, say that and say what you are comfortable with. Everything is negotiable. If your lawyer has presented his/her best offer and is unwilling to consider any counter offers, you can take it or leave it. Non-dischargeability complaints are difficult to win in most cases. Perhaps some kind of a contingency deal might get the attorney fully on board with winning the case.",

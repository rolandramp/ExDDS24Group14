    "title": "Is it okay to charge necessary dental expenses to a Care Credit card just before filing for Chapter 7 Bankruptcy ?",
    "question": "I'm getting ready to file for Chapter 7 Bankruptcy and I currently have a Care Credit card that I have not yet used . My child is needing some dental work done and I have no extra money to pay out - of - pocket . I'm concerned that if I wait to get the work done , I won't have access to Care Credit anymore , but I'm also concerned that it might look bad to be charging things on a card just before filing . It's my understanding that they would mostly be concerned with \" luxury \" purchases though , and I would think getting my kid's teeth fixed wouldn't be considered a luxury . . . Anyway , does this seem like something that would be OK or cause me problems ?",

        "I agree with Mr Bronson. Incurring debt with no intention of paying it back is, of course, fraud; and the look-back is more than 5 months. But since you are, I assume, willing to pay the debt back; you should be OK.",
        "I wouldn't. There is a 5-month look-back period that ends the day you file BK. If the creditor files an objection to discharge the amount of charges during the final 5 months will NOT be discharged. Sorry",
        "While I agree with most of what the other attorneys have said, I would be concerned that you could be held criminally for incurring the debt. Also, if the creditor or the trustee takes it to the Judge you have the potential of being denied discharge of ALL your debts based on incurring the debt in bad faith and misrepresentation. The litmus test is: would they have extended credit to you if you disclosed that you were planning on filing bankruptcy? The very reason for this conversation is the fact that you instintvely know it is not right. Anyone that would tell you to go ahead would be giving you bad advice no matter the reasons or the fact that you plan to pay them. If they file an adversary complaint for fraud you could end up paying a lot more than what you charged. Don't do it.\n\nWhile both denial of discharge or being arrested and criminally charged for fraud are unlikely, I would not take the risk of being perceived as a dishonest debtor or a criminal. It is just not worth it.\n\nPerhaps the savings on not having to pay other creditors may give you the funds to have the dental work done. It is possible that CareCredit may agree to extend credit after the case is filed.",
        "It is true that, technically, the creditor can file an adversary complaint against you, seeking an order that the portion of the debt owed to them and incurred within 5 months of filing is non-dischargeable. In reality, however, the creditor will first contact you to explain that point and will ask you instead to agree to re-affirm the objectionable portion of the debt. If you agree, you will be saving them the time, trouble, and cost, of preparing and filing an adversary action. In consideration for that fact, the creditor will often be willing to negotiate very favorable payment arrangements for you on that portion of the debt. Of course if the creditor doesn't contact you or file the adversary complaint, then the debt will be discharged. Recognizing that this debt would arguably be related to necessary urgent medical care, it's possible the creditor may not even raise the issue. The determination of whether this is in fact urgent medical care that must be done before your BK filing is of course yours, and your dentist's, to make.",
        "Your creditor may object on incurring debt prior to filing which could make the debt non-dischargeable. See 11 U.S.C. ยง 523. This process would be done through an adversary proceeding which could very well cost you more in the long run. I'd seek the guidance of local counsel who would take into account the specifics of your situation.",
        "Not adviseable. You would be opening yourself up to an adversary proceeding (a lawsuit within your bankruptcy) objecting to the dischargeabilty of that specific debt pursuant to S 523. The purchase of \"Luxury\" items w/in 90 days is only one cause of action for a creditors objection to discharge. Care Credit will most likely use the \"false pretense\" COA i surmise.",
        "Even if you did intend to pay it back, this would simply asking for expensive litigation within the bankruptcy . . .",
        "I won't advise you to take on debt prior to filing. I can say that a creditor could object to a debt incurred right before filing in which case that particular debt might not be discharged although your other dischargeable debts would be. So long as you are honest and complete with your filing you should not have to worry about the trustee arguing abuse of process. Discuss what might happen with your lawyer who will be familiar with what your local trustees and Court do in such cases."

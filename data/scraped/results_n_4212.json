    "title": "After Chapter 7, can the bank still charge interest and fees?",
    "question": "In California, I'm preparing a civil lawsuit against my bank. I filed Chap 7 a year ago, and I see in their payoff statement they are charging me late fees plus interest. Since I own no payments (i.e. I haven't reaffirmed the loan), they shouldn't be able to charge late fees. Also, do they have a right to keep tacking on interest? Would I address this in bankruptcy court or along with my civil lawsuit?",
    "answers": [
        "It would have helped had you described what type of debt you have with the bank. Was this for a car loan, a mortgage or an unsecured debt. The details sort of make a difference. BTW, if you sue a bank and you are found not to have a case, you can be held liable for paying the legal fees of the bank - which could run up a debt of tens of thousands of dollars. This debt for sure wouldn't be covered by your bankruptcy discharge. Hope this perspective helps!",
        "Civil suit for what? From your post, it seems you misunderstood the Bankruptcy process, and you may have had no lawyer then and no lawyer now. It may have been a wasted Chapter 7 if you did not use it wisely and have good legal advice. Many courts have become used to frivolous suits against lenders and can get rid of them pretty quickly. You probably would find a few thousand in the lender's attorneys fees tacked on the next statement.",
        "Mr. Moher has provided you correct information. You may wish to rethink the viability of your civil lawsuit which may only add to the pay-off amount of your loan.",
        "You are making some incorrect assumptions here. The bank still has a lien against the property. They can continue to charge their monthly mortgage payment, late fees, and interest according to the terms of the deed of trust that you signed. They can also exercise their rights against the property, such as foreclosure, if you don't honor the terms of the contract (i.e. the note and deed of trust). Additionally, if you file a civil lawsuit against the bank, they can add their fees for defending that lawsuit onto your loan.\n\nThe chapter 7 likely discharged your personal liability as to the mortgage, meaning if the bank forecloses they can't sue you for the deficiency (again, this is subject to a few narrow exceptions). Under current California law, it is unlikely the bank could have collected against you after a foreclosure anyways. But the bank still has their \"in rem\" rights against the property, and can continue to charge fees on the loan regardless of whether you filed chapter 7 bankruptcy.\n\nHope this helps!"

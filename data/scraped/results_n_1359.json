        "Do you currently have a legal separation judgment? Was a petition for legal separation filed and is it pending? In order to move into a dissolution, the current status of your case will determine what to do.

But if no judgment is pending the outcome of a legal separation, then you would need to amend the current proceeding. If a judgment was filed, then you would need to file a new petition for dissolution. Strongly suggest you seek legal assistance on this from a skilled family law attorney.",

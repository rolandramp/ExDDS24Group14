    "title": "School goes Bankrupt, new school takes over and wants to collect debt of bankrupt school. Can they do this?",
    "question": "School went bankrupt in August of 07, new school took over in Septmber 07. New school enters into an agreement with students that they will accept the credits taken, etc. and run the course of classes, etc. as it was left off. New school wants to collect debt of old school with cash payments and says that it can't be rolled into financial aid. Sounds fishy... Graduated and now they are holding dipoma until we enter into an agreement of cash payment for bankrupt schools debt. Didn't bankrupt school void its financial contract? How can new school have rights to collect bankrupt school's debt? I just want my diploma and will do whatever is legal/right. Thank you.",

        "Bankruptcy means the bankrupt entity can't pay its creditors. The new school probably bought the assets of the old school. Among those assets is the stream of income based on the old school's contracts with students.\n\nSounds like you continued to have the educational opportunity you signed on for.

        "The answer to the question lies in what was actually authorized by the Bankruptcy Court. You will need to find out what the new school actually purchased from the bankrupted (debtor) school. Once you have that information you will know better what your rights and remedies may be. It is possible they purchased the assets that included the accounts receivable, but even with that, the terms of what the court authorized are critical. Is it possible the new school is merely the reorganized old (debtor) school that retained all of its assets, including the accounts receivable? Certainly, more certain facts need to be known, and you may want to look at the court record for the old school.\n\nGood luck and best regards."

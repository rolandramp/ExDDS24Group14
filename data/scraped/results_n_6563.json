    "title": "Ex wife medical bills came to me. Our divorce wasn't final at time of visits. Do I have to pay?",
    "question": "I filed for divorce 2 years ago and it was only stamped and made official about a month ago. I just received a stack of medical bills from when my ex apparently went to the hospital for numerous (unnecessary) tests about 6 months ago. At the time of the visit she was still on my insurance (through my job) and has recently been removed after final divorce was stamped. These bills clearly state her name as the patient, but they were addressed to me. This is thousands of dollars that I do not have. I do not trust that if I give them to her that she will pay them, and I want to make sure any debt/credit issues do not affect my name and that it is not on me to pay. Am I legally responsible for paying these? How can I get this off my name? Could I take her to court? Any advice on next steps?",

        "If your wife's medical bills were incurred while she was still covered by your job-related health insurance, your insurance company should pay those bills. Submit those bills to the carrier, even though you removed your wife's coverage after the divorce was granted. If your wife's medical bills were for \"necessaries of life\", you could be responsible for those bills even if they were incurred during separation prior to judgment. You would best consult with, if not retain an experienced Family Law Attorney to represent you if your insurance carrier doesn't pay the medical bills.",
        "As stated by Mr. Corbin, it all depends on what is in the Judgment. You were likely required to maintain her on your insurance until the final formal Judgment had been field with the Court, hence her ability to stay on the insurance. There is also the factor that your are, in the eyes of the medical provider and your medical insurance, financially responsible for the debts. Remember, the providers and the insurance company are not parties to your insurance, and thus, they are not concerned with your divorce decree as much as they are concerned with getting paid, so they will report the debts.\nYour ex-wife and you started accruing separate property debts (each of you responsible for your own) at the time of your separation, so, it appears that she is legally responsible for the debts, again, depending on the language of the Judgment. The Judgment may also likely contain specific language that states she is responsible for separation property debts and that she is to indemnify you against any such debts.\n\nYou should talk to an attorney on how to proceed and on how to handle the situation.",
        "What does the divorce decree say - was she made liable for her individual debts from the date of separation (which would have been, I assume, some time ago)? Normally, a spouse is liable for the debts of the other for \"necessities\" - medical is a big one there. A divorce would, obviously, sever that responsibility. Yours happened in a gray area. Since they were submitted to your insurance, you were probably listed as the guarantor on the account. You may have to take her back to court and obtain an order making her liable for them. BUT, that won't stop the clinic from reporting it as a bad debt on your credit report if it goes unpaid."

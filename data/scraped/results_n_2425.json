    "title": "When should the Date of Identifiable Event be on a 1099-C?",
    "question": "I received a 1099-C from the original lender and I disagree with the date shown. Shouldn't it be the date when the original lender sold the debt to the collection agency? I would think that's when they had to write off the debt on their books. Not 2-3 years later.",

    "answers": [
        "1099 C's are issued in connection with debt forgiveness by a creditor, usually when you make a settlement for less than what is owed. Is the date relevant for the tax year you disclose it? This might be a question better answered by a CPA or accountant."

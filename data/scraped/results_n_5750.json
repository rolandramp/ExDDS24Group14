    "question": "What does it mean when it says the debt has been discharged awaiting closing",
    "answers": [
        "Not to quibble [good word (insofar as one's measure of verbal goodness is app-based): 24 pts in Words With Friends even without double- and treble-points), but on a bankruptcy tangent: distinguish discharge of (a specific) debt from a general chapter 7 or chapter 13 bankruptcy discharge. Bankruptcy Courts will issue an Order of Discharge; but the bankruptcy discharge will not itemize exclusions to discharge (e.g. nondischargeable domestic-support or student loans).",
        "Debtors and even some non-bankruptcy attorneys often confuse discharge and the closing of the case. While they often (but not always) occur close in time, they are not the same thing. For example, it is possible to receive a discharge but the case remains open for some time if the trustee is investigating possible assets or is in the process of collecting and/or liquidating assets of the estate.",
        "Just means it hasn't closed but your debts were discharged.",
        "It means that a discharge has been granted by the court but that the clerk of court still has a few loose ends to tie up before your case will be closed by the bankruptcy court. This is quite common and nothing to worry about. Congratulations!",
        "It simply means that a \"Discharge of Debtor' notice has been sent out by the court clerk, but the clerk hasn't entered an order actually closing the case yet. Usually the order closing the case follows the discharge notice within a few days."

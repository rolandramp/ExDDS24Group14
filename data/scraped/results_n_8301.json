    "title": "Question regarding the mortgage forgiveness debt relief in california.",
    "question": "I called my lender and am thinking of letting my house forclose due to the fact that I owe 333,000 and it is only worth about 180000, and due to financial hardship. The lender said i can foreclose but they will hit me with a 1099. Problem is, at the time, i was being offered housing through work so i was renting it out. Second thing is, I have a previous residence that is paid off that I also don't live at, a family friend is living there. I just don't see myself being able to financially pay the irs what they consider income due to the lender's loss. Is there anyway around this? How could i make this my principal residence, how many years would i have to live in it? Worst case scenario, if nothing can be done, how does a 1099 work?",

        "If this is a foreclosure, not short sale, I'm not sure why we're even talking about debt forgiveness. So I'm not sure what your concern is. If the lender chooses to do a trustee's sale, they can't come after you for deficiency. I don't think it matters at all if the property was your primary residence.",
        "Under the federal Mortgage Debt Forgiveness Tax Relief Act of 2007 (applicable till the end of 2012), you might not need to pay any income tax on canceled debt (which is the unpaid loan balance that is forgiven by lender) resulting from a foreclosure, short sale or deed in lieu of foreclosure if you as the borrower satisfy certain conditions for mortgage tax relief (e.g., primary residence, owned for at least 2 years, debt amount of $2 million or less).\n\nYour question then is, what is a principal residence?\n\nIRS Code section 121 defines “principal residence” as:\n“. . . during the 5-year period ending on the date of the sale or exchange, such property has been owned and used by the taxpayer as the taxpayer’s principal residence for periods aggregating 2 years or more. “\n\nIn short, if you lived in a home you own for 2 of the past 5 years from the date of sale, it is considered a principal residence. Simply go back 5 years from the date of the sale and if you lived in the home for a total of 2 years, it qualifies as a primary residence.\n\nFor more information on debt foregiveness and 1099-C, see:"

    "title": "How should I respond to a NOTICE OF RENEWAL OF JUDMENT?",
    "question": "I received a NOTICE OF RENEWAL OF JUDGMENT. I never received the original NOTICE OF JUDGMENT filed just under 10 years ago. I can only assume that this judgment was for a vehicle that was repossessed. I was either incarcerated or homeless at the time the original judgment was made. How do I respond?",
    "answers": [
        "It might be possible to bring a motion or an action to set aside the original judgment, if the court never validly obtained personal jurisdiction over you. You need to have a lawyer review the documents supporting the original judgment.",
        "The advice given seems to be sound, but you can consult with an attorney in person to make sure.",
        "I think it is far loo long to attempt to overturn the original judgment."

        "The other attorneys have correctly answered your question. Only the IRS has the ability to offset Federal tax refunds, not a private creditor. Internal Revenue Code Sections 6402(a) and (c)-(f) allow Federal income tax refunds to be offset against the following types of debts: (1) any liability in respect of an internal revenue tax; (2) a debt owed to any Federal agency; (3) debts for past-due child and spousal support payments; (4) past-due, legally enforceable State income tax obligations; (5) erroneous payment of unemployment compensation due to fraud or failure to report earnings; and (6) failure to make contributions to a State's unemployment fund for which the state has determined the person is liable. Debts owed to private creditors other than for past-due child or spousal support are not included among the debts for which tax refunds may be offset. Similarly, a regular private creditor cannot seize a tax refund from the government. The creditor, however, can garnish the proceeds of a tax refund check in the debtor's hands, such as when the check has been deposited into the debtor's bank account.\n\nThus, I wouldn't worry about your creditor being able to directly seize your tax refunds. However, as one of the other attorneys has emphasized, you need to resolve your debt so that you can normalize your financial life and stop \"ducking and dodging\" this creditor.\n\nGood luck!",
        "While there are lots of ways to collect an unsatisfied civil judgment, a tax intercept is not one of the methods that can be used by the debt collection lawyer or judgment creditor. However, if the debtor deposits the money into a bank account and soon thereafter the bank receives notice of a bank levy for the judgment debtor, then the funds on deposit can be taken, including the tax refund.\n\nBest thing that you can do is get out from under this fully. Either hire a debt collection DEFENSE lawyer or bankruptcy attorney to help get this discharged or settled and satisfied in full, because judgments have a nasty way of growing and showing up in most annoying ways for many years and harming credit, too. It may also be a lien on any real estate that has your name on title.\n\nRobert Stempler (please see DISCLAIMER below)",

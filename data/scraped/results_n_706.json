        "Student loans are generally not dischargeable in Chapter 7 or 13. More importantly to me, you seem to have ignored the requirement that you reviewed all of the information included in your Schedules filed in your Bankruptcy. You signed a Declaration under penalty of perjury that you did review your Schedules. Your duty is to review the documents for any omitted data, including assets that you own, their location and their values; debts that you owe...EVERY DEBT that you owe, including student loans; your income from every source, including the deductions from your paycheck, and your expenses, which must be properly itemized. If you didn't review your documents, and data was omitted, then you have committed perjury by signing the Declaration at the end of your Schedules A through J. What did you think those words in the Declaration meant? Read them again, and then ask why you would validate the accuracy of such documents when you obviously did not read them. Your exchanging emails tell me that you should have caught the missing data, even if your attorney forgot to include them. Never sign a document under penalty of perjury without asking whether you are telling the whole truth in those documents.\n\nOn the other hand, if your attorney did not provide the Schedules for you to review, or provide you with an opportunity to review them before you signed the Declaration under penalty of perjury, then your attorney did not perform to the standard required. Present your attorney with your evidence of his failure to properly guide you, and ask him what he will do to correct the matter. If he filed the documents without your signature, which is possible but terribly unethical, then report his misbehavior to the California State Bar. That is an egregious practice. I know it occurs in some offices where attorneys do not adequately supervise their staff, and such attorneys should not be allowed to practice law without being required to make restitution to clients that have been harmed and undergo discipline by the State Bar. I have little regard for attorneys that do not personally supervise the signing of the documents. It is not just a formality; it is the final opportunity to confirm with the client that the documents are accurate. What else was wrong in your filing? Unless you review the entire filing, no one could possibly know whether all of your assets were properly disclosed. You, alone, know what you own and who you owe. No credit report contains all debts and collection agencies and buyers of debt. They may not contain a school-issued student loan, although I do not know of a \"regular\" student lender that doesn't report to at least one of the 3 major bureaus.\n\nIf, and this is a big if, any of your student loans were dischargeable, then this circuit would allow you to reopen your case to add the omitted student loan and then sue for dischargeability. Take the advice already given, and seek an attorney who focuses on student loans and their dischargeability. It is absolutely a long shot, but that is your only recourse. Do not get your hopes up too high.\n\nAs for your other debts, like credit cards, as long as your case was a \"no-asset\" case, and you were able to keep everything you owned before you filed your BK, those omitted debts are discharged with those that were included. In re Beezley is an older case that has since been affirmed as \"good law\" that says omitted creditors have lost nothing in a \"no-asset\" case. If warranted, omitted creditors can always re-open the case if they felt they were defrauded by a debtor and not given the opportunity to participate in the BK. Therefore, your case would not require reopening to add creditors unless you could sue for the dischargeability of the student loans. In the end, it is never a good practice to fail to list all of your creditors; still, the burden is yours to review your documents. Please learn that lesson, and never sign a document that you have not reviewed for accuracy.",
        "You are not allowed to leave debts out of your bankruptcy. If you had a typical no-asset case, basically all allowable debts are discharged, even if you did not include them. However, student loans are a complicated part of bankruptcy law; they fall under a lot of exceptions. Even if a loan is not a federal student loan, it still falls under certain exceptions to discharge. This likely means the loans were listed on your petition, received notice of your bankruptcy filing, but were not discharged because they fall under an exception.\n\nAs Attorney Rausa states, it sounds like a Federal Perkins Loan. Even if it is not one of those loans, and the school provide a private student loan, it is still classified as a student loan. This means it is not part of a standard discharge. In order to discharge any student loan, you must file a separate lawsuit and prove that having to pay back the loan will create \"an undue hardship\" for you. The courts use various tests depending on where you live, but the standard is very high. Majority of individuals do not win these lawsuits, unless they are disabled or very elderly. At this point, you may be able to get into some payment plan or agreement to bring your account into good standing. If you have any concerns, I recommend talking to an attorney in your area that has experience with student loans. He/she can review your situation and determine if you may have special repayment options available to you or if there is any other course of action recommended.",
        "Atty J.D. Rausa is the person to contact re student loan issues. I concur with his response. How do you know the student loan debt was not included in your debt list? Even if it was included, the general rule is that student loans are not dischargeable.",
        "Your student loans were probably listed in your schedule of debts, but you can get a copy of this from the BK court in which you filed. Student loans are not dischargeable except in VERY RARE circumstances. Perkins loans are student loans. Get a consultation with new bankruptcy counsel if you wish to try to meet one of the exceptions.",
        "Student loans are typically not discharged in bankruptcy. Whether a student loan is discharged based on hardship is not automatically determined in the bankruptcy process. You must file a petition, called an adversary proceeding, to get such a determination from the court. To do so, you must show that payment of the debt “will impose an undue hardship on you and your dependents.” Courts use different tests to evaluate whether a particular borrower has shown an undue hardship. This is difficult and the standard is not that you didn't get a job and can't afford to pay. The bringing of such an adversary proceeding is not typically included in a bankruptcy retainer fee and would require a higher fee and would have been discussed by your attorney.\n\nJust listing, as you wanted your attorney to do, the student loan debt in your bankruptcy would not lead them to be discharged as you seem to be thinking. Not listing a debt is considered harmless error and debts that should have been discharged are typically considered discharged. So those debts you reference that were also not listed that are not student loans are already discharged.\n\nYou signed your petition under oath. You were responsible to review the petition to make sure all creditors were listed. You seem to want to blame the attorney but it was you swearing under penalty of perjury to the accuracy of your petition, not your attorney.\n\nIf you already filed for bankruptcy, but did not request a determination of undue hardship, you may reopen your bankruptcy case at any time in order to file this proceeding. You should consult another attorney to determine whether such an endeavor would be worthwhile in your particular situation. Most student loan debt is not dischargeable, so reopening to add the student loan debt and then bringing the necessary adversary proceeding might be pointless.\n\nYour attorney should have explained to you that student loan debt is not discharged in a chapter 7 bankruptcy. As this is standard, I assume this was explained to you.\n\nWhile the bankruptcy attorney might not have done a great job in listing all of your creditors as required and explaining the student loan dischargeabilty situation, I do not believe his/her actions caused you any harm. In other words, not listing the student loans and whatever other debts you are referencing is not the root of your current problems and feeling you were screwed by the attorney is probably the wrong mindset. In addition, you can reopen and deal with this matter now if the attorney you consult thinks it would be productive. Sorry.",
        "The intersection between Bankruptcy Law and Student Loan Law is very complicated. Typically student loans fall within the exception to discharge. What you have described is a Federal Perkins Loan. This is where the US Department of Education provides funds to the school, and the schools doles out the funds to student, and the school maintains the responsibility to collect those funds when due. All of this can be reviewed and explained once you obtain your student loan report from the US Dept. of Education @ nslds.ed.gov, and have the report reviewed, along with your bankruptcy case number, by California Attorney who specializes in Student Loans and Bankruptcy law. I am advising you to seek a consultation."

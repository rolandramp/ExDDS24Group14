If I recieved this summons does it mean there is already a hearing set?",

        "Yes, you can certainly try to settle. I have three legal guides on Avvo on how to negotiate and settle a debt collection lawsuit. Linked below is Legal Guide #1. The deadlines and how to respond are explained in my blog, linked below, on making your next steps count. Your are correct, if you must respond by a particular deadline, file that with the Clerk of the Court and pay any filing fees due at that time. I explain all six options in the first video on my home page, which includes settlement as one option. If you call the collection attorney, they will discuss settlement terms, you should not try to call Asset's office directly.\n\nRobert Stempler (please see DISCLAIMER below)\nwww.StopCollectionLawsuits.com\nTwitter: @RStempler",

        "Yes, you can settle out of court, either before or after you answer.

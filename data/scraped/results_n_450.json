        "Sometimes you can get 12 months, but never seen more than that",
        "I agree with Ms. Enmark, this is usually negotiated between the debtor and the creditor. Usually the creditor will have to agree if you want a longer period of time. Normally 3-9 months is normal, anything longer it is up to the creditor of whether they are willing to agree.",
        "Generally this is negotiated between the debtor and the creditor. It is possible to ask the judge for a longer period of time than the creditor is willing to offer, but this is something that does not happen often."

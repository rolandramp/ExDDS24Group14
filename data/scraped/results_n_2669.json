    "question": "I recently paid fees to recover my parents forclosed house, they are separated yet the bill never changed out of one of their names. Edison is trying to charge me for a bill they gave when the smart meters were put in. However I didn't live there at the time bug when I was a child I did they said I was responsible for it because they linked me to the house. I was raised they of course! But is that legal?? I seen a code forgot the # a while back that said i wasn't responsible if I have gained the home in any way...",

        "When you say you paid fees to recover the foreclosed house, did you bring it out of foreclosure and current in your parents' names? Or did you buy it at foreclosure sale? If you bought at foreclosure sale, you have no liability as long as the charges were incurred prior to your purchase. If you brought it current in your parents' names, you would have no ownership interest, and no liability as long as you never opened an account with SCE for that address. If you first opened an account with SCE for that address after those charges were incurred, you would not have liability for the prior charges, regardless if you lived there at the time the charges were incurred. The only possible issue I can see for liability is if your parents deeded the house to you, and the terms included assumption of all debts relating to the property. That still is a stretch considering you did not apply for services at that address until after the charges were incurred. There has to be a basis for legal liability, and simply living in a home will not give rise to liability for charges incurred for SCE.\n\nDisclaimer: The response given is not intended to create, nor does it create an ongoing duty to respond to questions.

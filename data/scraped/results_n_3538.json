        "I would recommend to wait until the divorce is finalized for a variety of reasons. However, if you decide to forge through with the chapter 13 while the divorce is pending, you will need an experienced lawyer.",
        "I would highly recommend waiting to file the bankruptcy until after the divorce is finalized if you can. If you need the protection of the automatic stay then file the bankruptcy first. I assume this would be a single filing for yourself. If you reside in California then you should file your Chapter 13 here in California, the bankruptcy court can administer your Nevada assets.

        "The first thing I always think when I see a question like yours is conflict of interest...CONFLICT OF INTEREST- for those who did not read that. If you file by yourself no problem. But absent that I believe you both need your own attorneys to represent you in a bankruptcy. I believe it is almost impossible to even articulate all the conflicts of interest your attorney would have to explain in order to represent both of you in such a case. But just you...no problem...An attorney can do that no problem...which leads to the next issue: when to file.\n\nI believe that normally you want to obtain your discharge in ch 7 before you obtain your divorce so that all community liability is discharged. Certainly, there could be exceptions and hence why you sit down with an experienced..and I mean experienced attorney..and some of those are here on AVVO and having read their answers you will be in good hands. But get an attorneys advice.\n\nI urgently and honestly believe in the above in having independent counsel. Just an example, how can an attorney even advise you what portion of a payment plan should either you or your wife pay without being in a conflict? They cant. I know at our seminars on this issue they always conclude..it would be far cheaper for YOU to employ your own attorney and for your attorney if he represents both to have very good malpractice insurance. Good luck.",
        "Yes, it can be done. However, it can be problematic on both sides. Depending on whether or not it is a plan that pays back 100% of your unsecured debts, may determine if you can even pay for the divorce Attorney.\n\nThus you absolutely MUST get a consultation from both a bankruptcy Attorney and a divorce Attorney.\n\nJonathan Leventhal\nLeventhal Law Group, P.C.",
        "As the other attorneys have pointed out, yes it is common for divorce and bankruptcy to intersect. Most, if not all, bankruptcy attorneys give free consultations so its important to sit down with one and analyze all properties, when they were acquired, all debts, and when they were incurred. Once this is all ironed out then an attorney can best advise you on whether to file for divorce first or file for BK first.",
        "You should meet with experienced counsel in your area that does family law as well as bankruptcy law to determine your objectives and how to best meet those and the timing of each case.",
        "Yes, divorce in conjunction with bankruptcy is common. You should consult with an attorney who has experience handling cases where both issues are present. You need to be aware of how the automatic stay affects proceedings in family court as well as how assets and debts are treated in each court.",
        "Yes, it can be done, but you definitely want to consult with experienced counsel who will analyze your entire financial situation. Is it better to wait? Is it better to file now? Is it better to file a joint case? It depends on your situation. Generally, property acquired during marriage is community property, all of which is included in the bankruptcy estate regardless of whether just one spouse files. Whether the property in your wife's name is community or separate, and the value of your separate property and the other assets of the marriage, will influence what exemptions you choose, which will impact your chapter 13 plan and the amount you have to pay. Don't rely on online message boards when it comes to such an important financial decision such as bankruptcy."

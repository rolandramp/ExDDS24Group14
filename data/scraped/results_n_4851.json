        "FL-150 documents are filed in, generally, every case. Many are used to support request for support, or defend such requests. At these brief hearings, declarations are filed to support or defend a position. Where errors are known, are proof can be shown, you can do so in a declaration. You can also subpoena documents for that hearing to show the misrepresentation.\n\nSadly, it is my experience that MANY people commit perjury on all types of issues in family court and rarely is anything ever done about it.

        "I am not sure what exactly your wife is lying about, but let me share with you a brief experience. I was in court explaining to the judge that the husband was clearly LYING ABOUT HIS TRUE INCOME because his FL-150 said he made $3,000 per month, but he was reporting $4,500 per month in living expenses, and there were no increasing credit card debts to show where he was getting this additional money to pay for the $1,500 in expenses above his income. So I said very loudly and stared at the husband while I said this, \"It is clear, your honor, that the husband is really making $4,500 per month and not $3,000 because he can't spend $4,500 per month if he does not have that kind of income.\" The husband became very red-faced and frankly did not know what to say, because we all knew he was really exaggerating his expenses. Essentially, I showed the judge that the husband was a liar, and the husband knew he had made a fool of himself in his zeal to try to show the judge he could not afford any child support or any alimony. I remember \"winning\" that case, but I do not remember the details of what was won, because it was some time ago.\n\nSo in your case, you can issue Interrogatories which will ask your wife specific questions which she must answer under penalty of perjury, and you can issue to her Request For Production Of Documents, which will force her to give you copies of documents which she has, which you need. Then when she refuses to give what you want in 30 days, she then waives her objections, and you can then give warnings, then serve/file a Motion to Compel and ask for attorney's fees and sanctions. You have to play tough if you want to make her do what she has to do. There is a lot more to be said about what you can do, but you get the picture. You are not powerless. Consult with an attorney who can give you the good legal advice you need, and you will be alright.",
        "I agree with counsel. You will need to not only tell the Judge but show the Judge why your ex has committed perjury (I.e. through use of documents and testimony). Discovery will need to be conducted in order to obtain evidence to support your position. I am not certain of the procedural history of your case; however, if you are responding to an RFO, address the issues in your Responsive Declaration. If you are the moving party, address the issues in a Reply. Either way, you will need to exhibit evidence to prove the inconsistencies.",
        "You need to conduct a discovery procedure and possible put her under a deposition. You need to seek legal assistance on this."

        "A 401k loan is usually money you are borrowing against your own retirement account. A discharge in bankruptcy does not really do anything for you there. Most people that file a chapter 7 bankruptcy case usually just end up paying back the loan even after the bankruptcy is done, so they have a retirement account to live on later in life. You should consult with a bankruptcy lawyer so you can get professional assistance with your case.",

But the most important thing is to meet with an attorney as you asking this question means you have not. You care about 2 goals: keeping everything you have equity in and discharging all your debts. If you don't have any of the exceptions to discharge you will obtain that goal; most exceptions are set forth in 11 USC. 523 (Google it) like child support, some income taxes, traffic (in a ch 7) and criminal fines , and presumption of student loans.

    "title": "I sent a letter of dispute for validation of the debt to a collection agency? I give them 30 days to response",
    "question": "I told them that I will require at least 30 days to investigate the information and during such time all collection activity must cease and desist.",
    "answers": [
        "It seems there are two separate things you are trying to do here: (1) exercise your rights under 1692g of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, and (2) exercise your rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act. With regard to the FDCPA, upon receipt of a dunning letter with the validation notice, YOU have 30 days within which to demand the debt collector verify your debt. During the time they are attempting to do this, they cannot attempt any collection activity against you. But they are not required to verify your debt in 30 days. Now, as to the FCRA issue, your letter as you have written in your question does not state that you are disputing a tradeline in your credit report and demanding a reinvestigation, so nothing is triggered with respect to the FCRA. But wait, it gets worse. Even if you did do so (and the FCRA does allow direct diputes with the creditor or collector), you trigger no right to a cause of action for their failure to reinvestigate because you must send this dispute to the CREDIT BUREAUS. I hope this was of some help to you.",
        "You are wasting your time. Since the advent of the Internet, consumers have learned about some of these technical rules and set out to make numerous requests for validation as well as disputing entries with the credit bureaus. These tactics seldom accomplish anything because collection agencies and credit bureaus are deluged with them and generally disregard them or respond in superficial fashion.\n\nIF you want to have a debt removed from your credit report, your best bet is to speak an experienced consumer lawyer in your jurisdiction and discuss the grounds for and merit of bringing a lawsuit. If there is nothing on your credit report, if you have not been sued, and if no real harm has occurred from the collection activities (such as your employer being notified), it may not be necessary to involve a lawyer.",
        "There is no right to demand a response to your validation request within 30 days. Demanding something you have no right to only makes you look weaker. Besides, why do you care if it takes more than 30 days to respond? The longer it takes them to respond, the longer they can't attempt any collections! So, let them take 6 months - who cares?!\nAlso, you cannot ask them to cease collections to allow investigation. You can ask them not to contact you, but they can collect all they want if they provide proper validation (subject to interpretation).\nAs for the credit reporting, is the collection agency reporting to your credit report, or is it the creditor. A collection agency can only control what it reports, not the creditor. If you really want to deal with your credit report, dispute directly with the credit reporting agencies and the creditor.\nBest advice, seek out a local consumer attorney for a properly worded validation request. Keep it simple - don't attempt to quote law that doesn't exist.",
        "Sending a validation request does not stop the creditor from suing you. You need to talk to an attorney like me who specializes in collection matters."

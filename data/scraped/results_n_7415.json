        "Since you signed a personal guarantee, you are ultimately liable for any unpaid rent for the balance of the lease term. But the landlord must make a reasonable effort to obtain a new tenant, and you would be well advised to do so also. If a new tenant comes in before your lease term ends, your liability is limited to the unpaid rent up to the time the new tenant takes over, plus the landlord's expenses in obtaining the new tenant. Until that happens, the exact amount you owe cannot be determined, and no collection activity could take place.\nIf your lease term has ended and the exact amount you owe can be determined, the landlord must first file a suit. Then, if he is afraid you might bolt the jurisdiction or otherwise become judgment-proof, he must apply to the court for a pre-judgment attachment, which is not easy to obtain. After a judgment, then all avenues are open to enforce the judgment.",
        "Yes, a landlord who has a judgment can levy bank accounts and garnish wages of the judgment debtor.\nThe best lawyer would be a business attorney, most likely a transactional attorney.",
        "Your second question is \"who is best professional\" to unwind the business, etc. from the liabilities you describe.\nA business or real esate attorney seems to be a good idea, but perhaps a bankruptcy attorney may be better. It should not be a bankruptcy \"mill\" but rather a bankruptcy attorney with experience in obtaining more relief than just liquidation of debts. I don't know the impact your SBA loan may have on the bankruptcy analysis.\nThis is analysis not legal advice per my disclaimer below.",
        "Yes, in the instance of a commercial debt, it is possible for the landlord to seek and obtain a prejudgment writ of attachment to attach on bank accounts and garnish wages before a judgment is entered."

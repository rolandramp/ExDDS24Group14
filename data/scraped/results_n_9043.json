        "If there are assets in the debtor's estate, you will receive notice to file a proof of claim that will entitle you to a distribution depending upon the size of the estate, and your priority relative to other creditors. You can still pursue debtor's insurance, if any. Finally, depending on the circumstances of the accident, if it was willful and malicous, or caused by a driver that was impaired by alcohol or drugs, your full claim would survive bankruptcy if you brought a claim for nondischargeability.

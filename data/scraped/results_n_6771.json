    "title": "Balance transfer checks & Chapter 7 Bankruptcy? How do I \"fix\" this without ruining my chance to file for bankruptcy?",
    "question": "My husband & I had approx 38K in credit card debt, recently we asked my parents for a personal loan of 17K. Right away I payed off a card & also payed a couple others down significantly. Two weeks later my parents had unexpected repairs on home & needed $9,000 of the loan back. I tried calling the credit companies to reverse the payments but it was too late. I then had to resort to a couple cards we had that offered balance transfers & had one send a $4,000 check & another a check for $5,000 (one in my name & one in my husbands name). Getting nowhere with debt we'd been trying to pay off for 8 years now, we did some research on bankruptcy & found out about \"insider\" loans, preferences & time frames for balance transfers,etc! I still have checks, what should my next step be???",

        "Have you repaid any of the loans from your parents yet? You don't state it, but if you did within 12 months prior to filing your bankruptcy case, it is a recoverable transfer. You can't really un-ring the bell on that one without there being other consequences.\n\nAs for the recent balance transfer, also a problem, but may be explainable depending on the overall pattern of usage on the cards. You would need to have a qualifed bankruptcy attorney evaluate everything and examine your options. Most likely the wise thing to do, unless there are pressing reasons not to, would be to wait a year to file your bankruptcy case and not incur any new debt in the interim.\n\nMark J.

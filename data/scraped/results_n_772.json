    "title": "Can I file a Chapter 13 BK if all of my debt is unsecured and I have no secured debts?",
    "question": "My income is too high to qualify for a Chapter 7 BK and I have a lot of high interest personal loans that I am behind on. I would like to set up a payment plan to pay off my unsecured debts but I want to know if I am able to file a Chapter 13 Bankruptcy solely for my unsecured debts.",

        "Not only can you file a Chapter 13 , but it can be an ideal way of helping a person with a higher income pay off his or her debts. Unsecured debts are paid without interest so that they can actually get paid within a five year period with a payment substantially less than the minimum required monthly payment. For a person who does not have enough disposable income to pay the debts in full, the debts would receive payments over the five year period and the balance would be wiped out, like with a Chapter 7 filing. In this situation, since the payment of attorneys fees do not increase the amount of the monthly plan payment, your attorneys fees can come out of your creditors' rather than your pockets.",
        "If you think that your income alone disqualifies you from chapter 7, that is a common mistake. An attorney will need to review your budget to determine what choices are available. Hope this perspective helps!",
        "Most of the cases I have filed recently are for exactly that purpose. Please that have more income than is allowed in chapter 7 may still need bankruptcy relief. Many times a chapter 13 Plan can be filed that provides for just a percentage of unsecured debt to be paid. Even when the Plan calls for full payment, or 100%, no interest is paid on the unsecured debt. That alone will provide a substantial savings and relief from overbearing debt.",
        "So long as your unsecured debts are $394,725 or less... this is the current upper limit for total unsecured debt under chapter 13 bankruptcy.\n\nBe sure to talk with an experienced bankruptcy lawyer about the other factors to analyze regarding chapter 13 eligibility.\n\nBest of luck",
        "Yes, you can.\nMy only question is your statement \"solely for my unsecured debts\".\nYou are required to schedule all of your debts; but you previously said you have no secured debts so I assume you're OK.",
        "Setting up a payment arrangement is an excellent reason to file a chapter 13, it doesn't matter if your debts are all unsecured. the bonus is that once you receive your chapter 13 discharge, the balance of the debts that were not paid through your plan are discharged.\nYou should at least consult with a qualified bankruptcy attorney before you file."

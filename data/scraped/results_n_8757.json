        "Determining the appropriate statute of limitations is not a something that can be oversimplified. There are variations between lenders, since some loans incorporate the laws and limitations period of other states or specific statutes. Federally guaranteed student loans are almost all exempt from any statute of limitations. The fact that SallieMae is servicing it or originated it does not determine if there is or is not a statute of limitations and what the proper period would be.

        "There probably is no statute of limitations on your loan, but you would need to provide more information. For example, even with a purely private student loan, the lender may use a guarantor that satisfies the requirements of 20 USC Sec. 1091(a)(2)(B), such that in the event of default the guarantor can pursue the debt without being affected by state limitations periods.

        "Statutes of limitations apply to all debts, whether they're based on oral contracts or written ones, and no doubt when you first took out this loan, you agreed that the lender could assign the loan to sucessors, so that doesn't affect the statute, which is 4 years from the date of breach.\n\nDisclaimer: Please note that this answer does not constitute legal advice, and should not be relied on, since each state has different laws, each situation is fact specific, and it is impossible to evaluate a legal problem without a comprehensive consultation and review of all the facts and documents at issue.

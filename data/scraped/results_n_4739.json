    "question": "This is a civil judgment",
    "answers": [
        "A self employed person is not earning \"wages\" and so you can't set up a garnishment. See the following guide for a helpful summary of the collection tools at your disposal: http://www.courts.ca.gov/partners/documents/collecting.pdf\n\nGood luck.\n\nhttp://www.johnphillipslaw.com",
        "I agree with attorney Lysle. In addition, I would say that you can also lien any real property belonging to the judgment debtor by recording an abstract of judgment in the county where the property is situated. Eventually he will want to refinance or sell, and then your judgment will be paid with 10% interest. And if he has enough equity in the property now, you can move the court to sell the land to pay your judgment. That's a bit costly and tricky, but starting the process sometimes leads the reluctant debtor to pay the judgment rather than risk losing his home.\n\nYou might want to consult an attorney who practices in this area for help. Good luck.",
        "You cannot do a wage garnishment if the debtor is not receiving wages. You can levy, using your Writ of Execution, on money that any of his customers owe him for work. You can also levy upon any valuable construction machinery, but that process is somewhat complicated. You can conduct a Judgment Debtor Examination, and you can examine third parties who have information about the debtor's finances.",
        "I am pretty sure CA has a process for what is called \"post judgment interrogatories.\" As a judgment creditor, you have the right to subpoena the defendant to answer questions and provide documents related to their financial circumstances. In short, you can ask them.\n\nFor someone who is self employed, you need to identify their customers, it can be laborious, but if you can find a customer that owes the debtor money, you can send a court levy to that customer ordering them to pay you instead of the debtor.\n\nDo a search for post judgment remedies or post judgment interrogatories to get more information."

        "Given the limited info in your question, it may be better to seek a \"summary dissolution\" rather than an annulment. Getting an annulment (called a \"nullity of marriage\") is a technical process requiring that you prove various facts at a court hearing. Often times, when people think there are grounds to end the marriage via the annulment process, it turns out that is not the case.\n\nSome more info: A marriage is \"void\" if there was incest (you married an immediate family member, someone closer than a second cousin) or bigamy (one or both spouses were already married).\n\nA marriage is \"voidable\" if one of the following six factors can be proved:\n\n(1) Minority of one party at the time of the marriage;\n(2) Prior existing marriage (applicable only when prior marriage was not dissolved because it was believed one party was deceased);\n(3) Unsound mind;\n(4) Fraud;\n(5) Force; or\n(6) Physical incapacity.\n\nYou should go online and research these 6 grounds further to determine if facts exist that would justify an judgment of nullity in your case. After doing some initial research, you should also consult with a family law lawyer (one who has experience with annulments) over the phone or in person to discuss the specific facts in your case further.\n\nAs for \"summary dissolution,\" you can find a lot of info starting here: http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov/selfhelp/family/divorce/summary.htm\n\nAfter reading more, you will see that 8 factors need to exist to qualify for a summary dissolution:\n\n1. married for less than 5 yrs\n2. no children together\n3. don't own any real estate\n4. no more than $6,000 in community debt\n5. no more than $38,000 in community property\n6. neither party has more than $38,000 in separate property\n7. both agree that neither party will ever get spousal support (alimony)\n8. both agree how to divide all property and debts\n\nIt sounds like you may qualify for this. And as said, summary dissolution (if you qualify) is a simple process.\n\nIf, on the other hand, you decide to pursue an annulment by filing a Petition for Nullity of Marriage, it is wise to plead in the alternative when you file your papers. I.e., seek a dissolution of the marriage in the same paperwork, in event that you cannot satisfy the burden of proof in the nullity action. This will avoid the necessity of starting over with filing a separate dissolution action if your annulment efforts are unsuccessful.\n\nAgain, if you decide you want to pursue an annulment, I'd strongly advise that you first consult with a lawyer who has previously handled such work. Good luck!",
        "I agree with the above answer, but would add that if you entered into the marriage without knowing or understanding some important fscts, you could seek an annulment. All of this being said, you probably should seek a divorce. If there are no property or child support issues, you might be able to do it yourselves. Go to Room 107-J at the main courthouse and ask a clerk for help If religious concerns are involved, you should seek pastoral advice. Good luck.\n\nThis is not personal legal advice, but an answer to a hypothetical person from someone I don't know.",

    "question": "I received 2 1099-C 's for 2013 from a bank for the same discharged debt. One 1099-C was made out to the corporation and one to me personally with my SSN. The corporation last conducted business in 2006.",

        "Atty Brewer is correct. Your discharge should absolve you of any responsibility to report the \"income\". Show this to your tax preparer. He/she will know what to do. Good luck.",
        "The 1099 in your name can be negated by submitting the discharge order and an IRS form 982. You will probably need an accountant's help to prepare this correctly for 2013.\nYour question does not say, but I assume that you took steps to dissolve the corporation? If so it should be relieved of any responsibility to file a corporate return, and your person filing of the 982 will absolve you."

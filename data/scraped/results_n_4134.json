        "You can file the divorce here in CA if you have been a legal resident here in CA for at least 6 months prior to filing the divorce. You don't need to be a citizen here and your marriage in India does not make a difference regarding filing here in CA. As to India's recognition, that is a question for someone who is licensed to practice law in India.",

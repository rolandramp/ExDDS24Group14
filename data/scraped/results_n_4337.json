    "title": "Bankruptcy and Trusts. I am a beneficiary to an irrevocable trust set up by my uncle. I need to file Chapter 7 bankruptcy.",
    "question": "I am 34 years old now. The irrevocable trust states that when I turn 35 (in 12 months) I will receive the property in the trust. The property in trust consists of $50,000 cash. If I file chapter 7 bankruptcy now, are the assets protected in this trust or can the Trustee reach into the trust and make this an \"asset case\" since the $50k amount exceeds California's wildcard exemption? I appreciate your detailed response so I get make my decisions if I can file BAnkruptcy. Also, I am not sure if there is a spendthrift clause in the trust... Thank you",

        "For anyone to really say, they would need to review the trust document. I don't think the issue is cut and dry. The key point in chapter 7 bankruptcy is your rights on the date you file. So the question is, what rights do you have to the trust assets now, versus in the future. However, it would be extremely risky and costly to file chapter 7 bankruptcy before distribution of the trust. Regardless of what anyone \"thinks\", the trustee will litigate the issue. So you will need a bankruptcy attorney experienced with litigation to go up against the trustee. Because the trustee will demand turnover, and if you have a legal basis to say the trustee is not entitled, you will be fighting about it in bankruptcy court\n\nAll things being equal, it would likely be unwise to file chapter 7 bankruptcy now.",
        "It is crucial that any bankruptcy attorney you consult review the trust paperwork. Most trusts nowadays do contain spendthrift provisions, but that does you no good if the assets become distributed to you and there is no exemption available to you. Would love to know why you feel you now need bankruptcy. Hope this perspective helps!",
        "A Chapter 7 trustee will hold the estate open and take the $50,000. If you need immediate relief file a Chapter 13. You will have to pay a dividend. An experienced Chapter 13 lawyer can demonstrate that in a hypothetical liquation the amount unsecured creditors would get if your debts in fact exceed $35,00 or so.",
        "You want detailed answers but have failed to provide the necessary facts for anyone reading your post to advise you except to say that you need to personally consult a local BK attorney. I agree that your best course of action is probably to delay filing. You need to engage in pre-bankruptcy planning if you do not want to lose at least some of the $50K to the trustee. Good luck. -- Michael",
        "DO NOT FILE BANKRUPTCY! When you file the bankruptcy, the trustee can keep your estate open and wait for the provision of distribution to become effective. I would wait for the distribution of the trust assets and then decide how to proceed. Your options include negotiating settlements with your creditors, investing the money in exemptible assets, or using the money for reasonable living, health, educational expenses. You need to get advice now from a local bankruptcy attorney. Good Luck!"

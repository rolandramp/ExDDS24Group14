    "title": "Can bank levy be reversed and money returned?",
    "question": "A bank levy was placed on a joint account I have with my mom. My personal checking in other bank has not been touched. I'm unemployed and have no assets, not even a car. I live with mom. If I hire an attorney, could I recover the lost money? It was my last little saving.",
    "answers": [
        "As soon as possible, prepare and mail to the levying officer (probably the county sheriff) a Claim of Exemption form: http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/ej160.pdf with attached Financial Statement form: http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/ej165.pdf.\n\nIn addition, read this list of statutory exemptions http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/ej155.pdf to see if any apply. Then find the amount(s) of that/those exemption(s) here http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/exemptions.pdf and enter it/them on your Claim.\n\nOnce the levying officer receives your Claim, he will hold the funds levied and provide notice to the judgment creditor, who then has the option to oppose the claim and set the matter for hearing. If the judgment creditor does not oppose the Claim, then the levying officer will return the funds to you.",
        "Another thing to consider is whether this bank levy was valid to begin with. If not, you may be able to receive compensation from the levying party in addition to the return of your money.\n\nFeel free to contact me if you believe that anyone may have engaged in any unfair debt collection practices.",
        "You may be able to fill out a claim of exemption and file it with the court to get some of the money returned to you. Te bank manager may have these forms, if not, you may be able to obtain them from the court that issued the levy. Hope this perspective helps!"

    "question": "I moved out of the house in 3/2006, we have been filing separate tax returns, and don't have anything between us. I was just told that because I haven't lived with my husband in for morethan a year, that I can get my uncontested divorce immediately. I need to find out if that is true.",

        "The date of separation doesn't matter. What matters is when the paperwork is filed and SERVED on the other party -- that's when the 6 months start. No getting around it. A cheaper process to consider if you have no children and you agree to division of assets and debts is summary dissolution. You would jointly file for that, but you will still wait six months for the finalization.\n\nStephanie White\nTHE LAW OFFICE OF STEPHANIE WHITE\nSimi Valley, CA\nwww.805Lawyer.com\n\nDISCLAIMER: The above is not legal advice nor does it establish an attorney-client relationship with the person posting the question or any person reading the above.

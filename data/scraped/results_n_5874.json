        "You make no mention of a bankruptcy, but tags on Avvo include bankruptcy.\n\nGarnishment is typically a state court matter.",
        "Punishment for bankruptcy crimes include but are not limited to fines in the neighborhood of $250,000 and/or a jail sentence up to 5 years and/or losing your discharge.",
        "denial of discharge.",
        "The creditor that is seeking the wage garnishment can request a hearing on your claim of exemption and a debtor's exam where you would have to present admissible evidence to the court supporting your claims. If it becomes obvious at that point that you have fabricated your claims then you may very well see how serious perjury really is. Do yourself a favor and sit down with a local attorney (bankruptcy attorney if you are even considering a BK, or else a general civil litigation attorney) and have your entire financial situation reviewed. You may be surprised to learn that there may be legitimate claims of exemption that you can make that don't involve lying. An attorney will often be able to point out exemptions you may be entitled to that you have not even considered.",
        "In many states, if the employer lies about the employer - employee relationship, or the amount of wages being paid, the employer can be found to be 100% responsible for the debt. Hope this perspective helps!"

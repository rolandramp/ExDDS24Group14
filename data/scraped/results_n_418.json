        "It is imperative that you consult with an experienced bankruptcy attorney. As my colleagues indicated, this may well fall into a category of debts that may be considered not dischargeable. The language of the judgment you received, as well as the facts, will assist in that analysis. When/if you receive notice that a bankruptcy was filed, immediately make contact with a bankruptcy attorney. You must file a complaint (called an adversary proceeding) in the bankruptcy case with the goal of obtaining an order in the bankruptcy court that the judgment is not dischargeable and there is a deadline to file such a complaint.",
        "If and when a bankruptcy is filed, you need to talk to an experienced bankruptcy attorney that represents creditors and handles litigation. 11 USC 523(a)(6) (a part of the Bankruptcy Code) excepts claims of a creditor cause by willful and malicious injury by the defendant/debtor. However, there will be a time limit for you to prosecure that claim in the bankruptcy court. The precise time is 60 days after the Meeting of Creditors and will be set by the court. You will receive notice of that deadline. If you don't file and Adversary Proceeding in the bankruptcy court by the deadline, your claim will be discharged.",
        "It sounds to me that there was a specific intent to harm you. A good review of the judgment needs to be reviewed to see if the findings of the court rise to the level of intent to fall within the exceptions to Discharge in Bankruptcy. It is unclear if you won by default where nothing was litigated. If that is the case and a bankruptcy is filed, you may have to litigate the case in Bankruptcy as an adversary proceeding.\n\nAt this juncture it does not appear that a bankruptcy has been filed, but you may want to check with a local bankruptcy attorney to have the judgment reviewed.",
        "There are exceptions to discharge of debt in bankruptcy but I don't know if this is one of them; I've changed the practice area to Bankruptcy."

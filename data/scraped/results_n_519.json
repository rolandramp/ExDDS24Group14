        "Depending on what chapter of bankruptcy was filed (you did not disclose that), you should file a proof of claim in each case by the court deadline to do so. Failure to do so might (again, depending on which chapter was filed) preclude you from sharing in any distribution to creditors.",
        "Do you know what type of bankruptcies were filed by the partners? I recommend filing proof of claims in the bankruptcy cases attaching your judgment. This gives notice to the bankruptcy court and trustee that the debtor owes you money. You may also want to file an adversary proceeding objecting to the partners receiving a discharge if you know of assets the partners may be hiding. I would speak to a bankruptcy attorney right away, specifically one that represents creditors.",
        "I’m not sure what you mean by “I have a feeling no attorney will offer just . . .” Nor where that figures into your question.\n\nWhen a person who owes you money files for bankruptcy, hire a bankruptcy attorney to help walk you through the BK claims process and also to see if there is an insurance policy to get court approval to pursue.\nRe-categorizing this question under bankruptcy law so those attorneys see it.\nIf you have not done so already you may want to look into complaining with the California bar and seeing if your type of damages qualify for funds from the bar’s client restitution fund.",
        "It sounds like you need to consult a bankruptcy attorney.",
        "Start by talking to a bankruptcy lawyer - but someone who really understands you and the details of the case at hand. You may have good options to preserve your rights to recovery on the judgment. Time is of the essence because of statutory deadlines and because when there's a judgment, there's often shady shifting of assets. Also, there may be some possibility of collecting against the LLP's insurance.",
        "I agree with the other responses. You need a bankruptcy attorney to help you file an ADVERSE proceeding in their bankruptcy cases. If the bankruptcy was filed fraudulently, it may not be discharged (as well as for dozens of other reasons). Don't wait - your time to file an adverse action is limited. Good luck!"

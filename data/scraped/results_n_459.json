    "title": "How can I help my daughter?",
    "question": "My daughter got divorced approx 10 years ago and now, after almost 6 years, has a judgement against her for her husbands attorney and court costs. Her mother has started an online business to help her and because she knows nothing about computers asked her daughter to help her. Her name is on the business licence and she pays the taxes. Because of this and my daughter is penniless, she is now being sued to pay for the judgement which now, with accumulated interests, is $365,000. Approx. 6 years ago my daughter filed for chapter 7 bankruptcy but for some reason her judgement was not included.",

        "First, the award of attorney's fees and costs is enforceable under California law until paid, as money judgments under the Family Law Act are not subject to the 10-year limitation on enforcement unless renewed.\n\nIf your daughter previously filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy, the award of fees may have been discharged, notwithstanding the omission to include the claim, if the award of fees was based upon conduct and not her former husband's needs, i.e., the fees were a sanction and not a needs-based award due to the disparity of their incomes at the time.\n\nThere would seem to be no basis for your wife to be liable for the payment of the family law fee award, at least not based upon the fact that your daughter's mother is listed on the business license and pays the taxes. It is unclear whether there is more than one single judgment for attorney fees arising from simply one family law case. Generally, one is not liable for the debts of another, absent a written agreement to pay those debts.\n\nYour situation is unclear but sufficiently complicated that you would be well advised to spend an hour with a qualified specialist in bankruptcy, but also someone with a good working knowledge of the principles of family law.\n\nYour daughter would be well advised to also consult bankruptcy law specialist to determine the extent of the impact of her prior Chapter 7 discharge upon the award of attorney fees to determine whether that fee award was one subject to discharge on the basis that it was a sanction, and not intended to be in the nature of support based upon need.",
        "Attorney Boyer is correct. Your assets are likely safe. Depending on facts not disclosed, your daughters bankruptcy may have discharged the judgment debt.

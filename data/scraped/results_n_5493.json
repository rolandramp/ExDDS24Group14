    "title": "How do I use Delaware Statute of Limitations as a defense in California Against Discover Card",
    "question": "I recently received a summons from Discover card . I live in California . The credit card agreement contains a Delaware choice - of - law clause to be applied \" without regard to conflict - of - law principles . \" Under Delaware law , the statute of limitations for breach of contract is three years . It has been 3 years and 3 months since my last payment . How would I use this as a affirmative defense in California . Also , in July of 2010 I had a verbal agreement with them to charge no interest or fees until I was in a financial position to make a payment . My statements show no interest or fees for a number of months thereafter . I never was able to make a payment since then . Does California's 2 year Statute of Limitations on verbal agreements apply here ? Thanks so much for your gel",

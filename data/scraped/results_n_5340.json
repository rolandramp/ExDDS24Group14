    "title": "Can a CH7 Trustee claim Bona Fide Purchaser when the property was fraudulently transferred into the estate by Quit Claim Deed?",
    "question": "I transferred real estate from myself to a LLC, which I am the managing member, by Quit Claim Deed. I then filed CH11 on the LLC. The CH11 was converted to CH7 by the Court. A creditor wants the property transferred back to me and out of the CH7 estate so he can collect money I owe him. The Trustee is claiming Bona Fide Purchaser; the creditor is claiming Fraudulent Transfer within 4 years that California law provides for. I was insolvent when I made the transfer. I need a US Court Case, or California Supreme Court case, on point. I find many cases where property is transferred out of the estate before filing bankruptcy; this matter is a reverse.",

        "First of all let me say this much: If you file a homestead exemption form in public records, it will not preclude the creditors from forcing the sale of your home, nor the trustee in a Ch. 7. Here are the reasons why:\n\nA. Your creditors ALREADY have judgments, so your homestead declaration will be subsequent in time to their judgments.\n\nB. A homestead declaration filed prior to any judgments or subsequent non-consensual liens, only means you can sell your property despite the subsequent judgments and non-consensual liens and retain your exemption.\n\nC. If you file a Ch. 7, the trustee becomes the hypothetical judgment lien creditor and can still compel the sale of your home. This is so because the homestead declaration is not absolute. And a Ch. 7 does not involve the consensual sale of your home. So filing one now won't do a bit of good.\n\nNow for the important part. You have an automatic homestead exemption of $75k of your equity in the property. Equity means that the value of your home, less the mortgage balance and any resulting liens equals your equity. You may be entitled to an enhanced homestead exemption of up to $175,000.00 of your equity.\n\nIf a creditor/trustee seeks to levy on your home, you may assert your enhanced homestead exemption if you can establish you earn less than $35k per year as a married couple or $25k if you are unmarried. The enhanced exemption is up to $175,000.00. There is an intermediate amount of $100,000.00.\n\nHowever, if you are unemployed, disabled and provably earning less than the minimum amount listed, then you probably qualify for the enhanced exemption.\n\nThat said, unless the creditor or trustee can prove that your equity exceeds the mortgage, and liens, its unlikely the trustee will try and sell the property.\n\nMoreover, if there is any equity left in the property then the judgment liens will sail through and still remain attached to your homestead, subjecting it to a forced sale.\n\nSo this is the tricky part: if you want to keep your home, you may have to file a Ch. 13 rather than a Ch. 7.\n\nI strongly suggest that you consult with and retain a seasoned bankruptcy lawyer in your area, rather than try and do this on your own. That's my suggestion."

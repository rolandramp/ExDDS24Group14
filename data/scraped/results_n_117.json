        "The transfer of title to you ex-wife may be challenged by the Chapter 7 Trustee, who has the power under bankruptcy law to reverse or invalidate transfers made prior to a case being filed. Trustee may avoid a transfer where the debtor received less than a reasonably equivalent value in exchange for such transfer. More facts are needed to evaluate your specific circumstance.",
        "There are a lot of factors at play here and you should definitely consult a bankruptcy attorney who can go through everything with you before giving you an answer.",
        "The good news is you know you need to speak to an attorney. Do that NEXT. No attorney on here can possibly advise you which chapter to file..impossible ...as there are many facts and questions an attorney must go through and the be able to advise you. You never file a ch 13 unless there is an advantage or reason to do so and I see none yet either FYI.\n\nYou are in a community property state too and thus if debts were incurred during the marriage I do urge you to meet with an attorney before your divorce is final.\n\nI do see you have some incorrect beliefs on you filing bankruptcy vs foreclosure etc. as if someone is paying the mortgage there will be no foreclosure but the effect of filing on said property by one of you is the real issue on its effect. Thus, call an attorney and meet today!\n\nYou need and want to enjoy your fresh start also. But the most important thing is to meet with an attorney as you asking this question means you have not. You care about 2 goals: keeping everything you have equity in and discharging all your debts. If you don't have any of the exceptions to discharge you will obtain that goal; most exceptions are set forth in 11 USC. 523 (Google it) like child support, some income taxes, traffic (in a ch 7) and criminal fines , and presumption of student loans. But some debts are dischargeable in a ch 13 but NOT in a ch 7 so you want to make sure and your attorney will discuss any such types with you also!\n\nYour exemptions depend on what state you have lived in in the last 2 years and thus if in your state, then your states exemptions will apply. Most persons filing keep everything they own but your attorney will confirm that with you when they learn everything you own and the equity thereof!\n\nSome secured debts like homes, vehicles, other secured debts an attorney will discuss your options on also as you must list any debts; but that does not mean you will lose them unless you have too much equity or are in default on paying for them! Discuss those options if they apply with your attorney too.\n\nBut other issues can arise that can greatly harm your case. Just one example: If you paid back a relative $3,000 11 months ago and now file bankruptcy next week, the trustee can SUE that relative to retrieve that $3,000 (under what is called a preference) for the benefit of the bankruptcy estate. As a result, most attorneys don't charge to meet with them the first meeting so meet with one no matter what.\n\nMany great attorneys can be found right here on AVVO in your state so look, call, and meet one as soon as you can.\n\nYou should also want to know when to file: is there an advantage of waiting versus filing now and who should you pay between now and then! Good luck and enjoy your later fresh start."

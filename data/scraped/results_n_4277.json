    "title": "Can the judge order me to remove my wife's name from the mortgage or order me to refinance our home in my name only in a divorce",
    "question": "My soon to be ex-wife and I are upside down approximately $100K in our house. She wants me to remove her name from the mortgage or refinance the house in my name only before she will even negotiate a settlement with me. Can a judge order this? I would like to keep the house to provide some stability for our two sons who are attending college and live at home with me. I have the ability to pay the entire mortgage on my own and would not ask her for any money but am not willing to assume the debt myself. I would have no issue with refinancing or selling the house once the market turns around and the boys have moved out.",
    "answers": [
        "The court only has jurisdiction over the parties. They can order the parties to do something but it cannot order a third party to do something such as modify the mortgage unless it has jurisdiction over them.",
        "A judge can order anything necessary to effect an equitable division of the assets AND debts. But if the house is upside down, why not short sale it and get out from the burden of the debt? If you sons are over 18, then the court will be less likely to maintain the family residence. It makes a better business sense to sell it.",
        "Yes, a judge can but there are other alternatives, one of which is to pay and hold her harmless. There is also wording to protect her in the event of a bankruptcy. Another option is as stated by you to do it later. I'm guessing you do not have an attorney. You should get one.",
        "Judges can order whatever they want. However, since the property is upside down, that would be an order you can't accomplish. So, my best guess is the judge will not make that kind of order. The wife's name cannot be removed from the note unless you refinance or sell the property. If you keep the property, you can agree to a hold-harmless or indemnity provision to protect your wife. Otherwise, if she doesn't agree, you may have to short sell the property. Good luck."

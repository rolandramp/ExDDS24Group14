    "title": "I won an Adversary Proceeding in a Chapter 7 against the defendant for willful and malicious injury for converting my property..",
    "question": "He now has gone on to file a chapter 13. His lawyer says he is not attempting to discharge my judgment because it is too soon after the Chapter 7 filing, and to file a proof of claim. Is this true? Or could they attempt to discharge it last minute? I just filed a Proof of Claim. The same debt could technically be discharged since the willful and malicious definition needed for discharge does not hold up in a Chapter 13 from what I'm reading.",

        "I agree with Mr Whitaker. However, what you actually collect may be minimal, depending on his income or assets, which may be minimal or exempt if he filed under Chapter7 to begin with. Bottom line is you may not get much anyway. Get an attorney and file a Proof of Claim. This is not legal advice. It is information. It does not create an attorney/client relationship.",
        "His lawyer is correct. He is not entitled to a discharge in this Ch13 because it has not been 4 yrs since his Ch7.\nHowever, after a couple years, the debtor may dismiss this Ch13 and file another in which he might be able to discharge what remains of your 523(a)(6) debt.",
        "It is a non dischargeable debt on several levels. It has already been judicially decided, and, they are not entitled to a discharge. File your POC correctly and wait for the trustee to notice out payments"

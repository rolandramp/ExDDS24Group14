        "Agree with colleagues. First determine if new or different account being collected. Yes. Creditor can continue to attempt to collect debt after an EWO terminated. EWO does not cancel validity of the underlying debt. Not uncommon for creditor to send debt out to multiple law firms for collection.",

If there's already a pending lawsuit, and some other law firm is glomming onto this, then you have to advise them that the creditor is already represented by counsel; and that by demanding money from you during the pending case, they may be practicing law without a license in your jurisdiction.\n\nIts sounds kooky but sometimes they have a pool of attorneys that grab a list and work it. So its possible you're being hit on by two firms; the question is why?\n\nNo one can answer that until you go and check the docket and confirm everything.",

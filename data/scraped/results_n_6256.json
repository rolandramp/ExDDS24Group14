        "Liability insurance will only protect you against the possible liabilities your business may incur. If the insurance is insufficient to cover a liablity concerning your business then the creditors would look to your personal assets.\n\nYour business sounds fairly low risk based upon what you are indicating so if you maintain adequate liability insurance I would thinkyou would be ok.\n\nBW",
        "Congratulations. Insurance is a great way to protect assets and I highly recommend that you work with a great insurance agent and obtain robust coverage. However, insurance does not cover all potential risks and may not fully cover you in major loss situations or intentional type liability situations. You really should arrange for a consultation with an experienced business attorney to go over the liability protection provided by business entities other than a sole proprietorship, such as a corporation. After a consultation with a qualified business attorney, they should be able to advise you on which business entity will provide you with the greatest protection and how to go about maintaining your business entity so as to maintain the greatest amount of liability protection. Lastly, you should also bring in your accountant to work with your attorney and you on the best business entity to choose from a tax savings stand point. Good luck",
        "Liability insurance is your best protection for accidents and such. But it wont protect you if the company incurs other obligations, like leases or phone bills.\n\nForming a corporate or LLC could (it might not) protect you from those contractual obligations (leases, phone, credit cards) but only if the company gets its own credit. New small companies usually have to have their agreements guaranteed by the owner.\n\nAnd so long as you are doing the work yourself - your personal assets will be liable for the company's debts based on negligence because corporations and LLCs don't protect against the owner's own actions.\n\nSo insurance is the best protection initially. Actually, being careful is your best protection and then insurance.\n\nBut there is no way you can protect yourself against any and all liability. If there was no risk in owning a business, more people would do it. With the risk comes the potential for rewards."

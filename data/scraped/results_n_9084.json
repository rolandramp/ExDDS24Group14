    "title": "Will a 2nd mortgage that was lien stripped through current Chapter 13 be discharged if I receive a hardship discharge?",
    "question": "I filed a chapter 13 bankruptcy over 1 year ago and subsequently received a lien strip on the second mortgage. In the meantime, my spouse has become very ill and our finances have gotten dramatically worse. We are hoping to obtain a hardship discharge, but need to know if the lien strip will still be in effect and will be discharged.",
    "answers": [
        "If the valuation motion and order or Plan had/has the correct verbage, the discharge whether hard or soft, quick or easy....makes no difference, and make sure it is correct before the discharge...",
        "So long as the Chapter 13 is discharged, the lien strip will hold. Make sure that you or your attorney files whatever documentation that your jurisdiction requires to complete the lien strip. Without documentation in the chain of title, the lien still exists on the record."

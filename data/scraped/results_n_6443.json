        "When you receive a discharge the legal obligation to pay the discharge debt is eliminated. Even if the debt is later sold to a collection agency, the agency only has the same rights that the original creditor had. So, if you have a defense against the debt by claiming that the debt was discharged against the original creditor, the same defense will apply against the collection agency that purchased the debt. In short, the collection company will stand in the shoes of the original creditor, and is subject to the same defenses as well.",

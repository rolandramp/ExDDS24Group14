    "question": "Is it legal to work in Mexico ( with an work permit) , if you have you I-485 pending for Adjustment of Status . I-131 is approved and advance parole is valid until August 2010.",
    "answers": [
        "Unless you do not have a work permit in Mexico, I do not see any problem. Remember if you have a pending I-485 based on employment, it is for future employment. Therefore, only the time when you get the green card then you have to work for the company. But you will have to work for the company when you get the green card, there is not option on this unless you were terminated. Lately on AC21 issues (read more on our website), USCIS has become quite strict. For this reason, talking to your lawyer is important. Note that there might be other issues involved on the I-131 itself. You might want to talk to a good immigration lawyer to analyze your options.\n\n\nGood Luck\n\nShah Peerally\n\nTo know more about us, just click on profile and click on our website.\n\nFounder and Managing Attorney of Shah Peerally Law Group PC\nThe Law Firm Deals in Immigration law, Bankruptcy & Debt Relief\n\nNote: The above answer is provided for informational use only.

        "As long as your I-131 is in order, you may remain outside the US for a period of time. I would suggest you return regularly to the US so as to avoid any issues with CBP at the Port of Entry."

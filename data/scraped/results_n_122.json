    "question": "My wife just had a brain aneurysm and is in a coma in the hospital. Not sure what her recovery will be. We have been separated for a few years but have always been in touch with each other. My daughter who is 24 lives with her along with my step son. I'm have been paying all the bills all along. I'm thinking I might run into some issues trying to take care of her personal credit cards and bills.",

        "In view of your wife's medical condition, a PoA cannot be legally obtained because the giver has to be able to sign and understand what she is doing. Ask the hospital what they will accept instead of a PoA. Good luck and God bless.",

        "Sorry to hear about that medical issues. You are only liable for any community debts incurred which if any were in CA before separation those are both of yours.

        "All answers posted thus far are good. In addition, depending on the amount of the Judgment and other debts you or your husband may have and your ability to pay those back, you may want to consider your bankruptcy options. Bankruptcy can be a cost effective way to wipe out judgments and debts. Also, bankruptcy typically stops creditors from harassing and calling you. I suggest speaking with an experienced bankruptcy attorney. Its free advice and would not hurt you to get further options.",
        "If they obtained a judgment, the Statute of Limitations would no longer apply. As far as the threat to garnish your Cal Fresh, were you talking with an attorney or with a non-attorney collector? Did the collector identify himself as an attorney? Did you check the status of his license with the State Bar? How can you prove what was said in a telephone conversation?\nDo not take legal advise from a debt collector.",
        "Since government benefits, such as Cal Fresh, cannot be garnished to pay a civil judgment, I would say that the comment is misleading and in violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA). There is a one-year time limit to sue under the FDCPA or Cal. FDCPA, so a lawsuit for those violations should be filed within that time frame or be lost due to the statutory period expiring. As for collection of a judgment, they get 10 years from date of judgment to collect and that can be renewed another 10 years. I would consult a consumer attorney and/or a debt collection DEFENSE attorney about both issues to explain your options, rights and remedies further."

    "title": "How long does a wage garnishment last?",
    "question": "I have a judgment against someone. I had a wage garnishment served. Do I have to have another one served every week (he gets paid weekly) or will it last for awhile or until the judgment is paid. Also, if the debtor is a 1099 employee, do I only get 25% of the gross or can I get it all?",
    "answers": [
        "Mr Loker is right - they can keep garnishing till the payment has been paid in full",
        "The wage garnishment lasts until the judgment is satisfied. Also, 25% is the max"

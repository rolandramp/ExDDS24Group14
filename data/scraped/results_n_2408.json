        "Conversion from chapter 7 to chapter 13 is allowed only on motion. There is no specific form for you to complete. However, there are certain facts that must be pled in the motion. Mainly, you must specify the reason(s) for the conversion and that the case has not been previously converted. The motion must be accompanied by a notice giving all parties in interest the right to object. Keep in mind that the chapter 7 bankruptcy trustee may object to the conversion if your only reason is not wanting to turn over any non-exempt assets for distribution to your creditors. This is quite common around tax time, when debtors realize that they must forego of most or all of their tax refunds to receive discharge. My recommendation is to consult an attorney before filing anything with the court. The second issue is that you would have to file and serve a chapter 13 plan within two weeks from converting your case. This is not an easy task and you would need an attorney for sure. Good luck!",

I strongly recommend you consult with and retain a local bankruptcy attorney to handle your Chapter 13 for you, so that you will not waste a lot of your time and money on a case that in all likelihood will end up being dismissed by the Court. Many attorneys will offer a free initial consultation so they can meet with you and review and discuss your situation and how a Chapter 13 works. A Chapter 13 is completely different from a Chapter 7 and is definitely not something you should attempt on your own."

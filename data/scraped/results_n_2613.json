    "title": "Capital One won't remove my one and only late payment. It's hurting my credit. What are my rights? What can I do?",
    "question": "I have one and only 30 days past due late payment on my credit report and thats with Capital One. I've tried over three times disputing the late to see if they can remove it off goodwill but they've denied me every time. What does The Fair Credit Reporting Act entitle me to? I know it's not a big deal having a late payment removed especially if I've been with them for 5 years. People get it removed all the time. What are some additional actions I can take as far as sending more effective letters? Is there a law that states that a consumer is allowed 1 goodwill forgiveness? Please help me.",

If you have been a good customer, and you have a good excuse, like you didn't get the statement in time, or you were out of the country, (whatever), a bank will almost always waive the late charge and report you as current. I think you pissed off the bank by going directly to the credit bureau and wasting everyone's time disputing the existance of a fact that everyone knows to be true.",
        "Paying it off as suggested will likely not improve your credit rating in relation to the delinquency. The credit history is available and part of your score regardless of whether the debt is paid as agreed. Indeed, if the report of the debt as late is correct, then the creditor has the right to report it as late for that month. You don't have any right to have the reporting removed if it is accurate. There is no \"goodwill\" removal requirement."

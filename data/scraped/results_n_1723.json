    "question": "Their PG&E is the tenants responsibility. Their bill is higher then 2,000 dollers. We were unaware they were not paying. Bill is under tenants name. She asked us (landlord) if we could put the PG&E in our name. Not happening!",

        "Rather than issue a three day notice, I would sit down with tenant and see how you can help them work things out. Not by paying their debts, but find out what's going on. Especially if they have been reliable tenants on rent and other issues. Perhaps you can defer (not reduce) their rent temporarily while they pay PG&E. That's just an example of a possible solution.\n\nIf you put them out, you might end up being stuck with the bill anyway, or going through process with PG&E, delaying a new tenant's move-in. So check things out with PG&E and your tenant, before acting. That won't take long and negotiated resolution is always better than starting the eviction process, though sometimes that cannot be avoided.\n\nWorse case scenario is you have to pay off PG&E and chase moved-out tenant to collect. Don't rush to that problem."

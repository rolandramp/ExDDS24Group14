        "Although I agree completely with my CA colleagues, if this Debtor chooses to file for Bankruptcy and you can prove a fraudulent transfer to avoid creditors, then the Debtor will be facing possible Federal Criminal charges. So while retaining another attorney, will add to your costs, the Debtor filing for Bankruptcy could result in the Debtor receiving a visit from the FBI. The FBI is responsible for investigating Bankruptcy crimes. So the Federal Government could highly motivate him to pay the debt to you. So, the debtor will be doing you a favor, if a bankruptcy is filed, so do not be alarmed if that happens. THIS IS NOT LEGAL ADVICE! YOU NEED TO SPEAK TO AN ATTORNEY WHO IS LICENSED IN YOUR STATE FOR LEGAL ADVICE. This is merely suggestions for you to think about in discussing your situation with the local attorney.",
        "I agree with Mr. Winfield. I will only add that if the judgment debtor transferred his assets to his father to avoid his creditor, he may be exposed to additional liability as a fraudulent transfer.",
        "Yes you can collect from the wife of the Judgment Debtor - specifically you can reach your Judgment Debtor's community property interest in the spouse's property including wages, bank accounts and real estate."

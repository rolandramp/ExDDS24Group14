    "question": "So I am in default already on my mortgage for the mobile and am ok with walking away from it. But what I don't know is how the private company whom I pay space rent to separately from my mortgage works in this whole deal. Will I need to keep paying them to allow me more time before the mortgage forecloses? Will the mortgage company take over the space rent obligation to protect their collateral.",

        "Always discuss with your ch 7 attorney which apparently you have not chosen to employ one. If not, still meet with one..its usually free with most attorneys.\n\nThe lease and the secured debt will be both discharged. But are you liable for anything post petition? What if someone takes over the home and gets hurt after you file and before it is repod? Maybe you can discuss with the creditor if they will pay you $500 for a voluntary transfer of title back to them to help them avoid having to repossess it etc. Call and ask them. Meanwhile, there are other issues and facts that can substantially and gravely affect your case which is why all of us will tell you the same: employ an attorney. Here are some of those other issues!\n\nYou need and want to enjoy your fresh start also. But the most important thing is to meet with an attorney as you asking this question means you have not. You care about 2 goals: keeping everything you have equity in and discharging all your debts. If you don't have any of the exceptions to discharge you will obtain that goal; most exceptions are set forth in 11 USC. 523 (Google it) like child support, some income taxes, traffic (in a ch 7) and criminal fines , and presumption of student loans. But some debts are dischargeable in a ch 13 but NOT in a ch 7 so you want to make sure and your attorney will discuss any such types with you also!\n\nYour exemptions depend on what state you have lived in in the last 2 years and thus if in your state, then your states exemptions will apply. Most persons filing keep everything they own but your attorney will confirm that with you when they learn everything you own and the equity thereof!\n\nSome secured debts like homes, vehicles, other secured debts an attorney will discuss your options on also as you must list any debts; but that does not mean you will lose them unless you have too much equity or are in default on paying for them! Discuss those options if they apply with your attorney too.\n\nBut other issues can arise that can greatly harm your case. Just one example: If you paid back a relative $3,000 11 months ago and now file bankruptcy next week, the trustee can SUE that relative to retrieve that $3,000 (under what is called a preference) for the benefit of the bankruptcy estate.

        "A FL-144 is an agreement or stipulation to waive the final declaration of disclosure in a dissolution case.\nIn a dissolution case both parties are required to file a preliminary declaration of disclosure. This is a statement tell the other person what assets and debts the community may have and what their income is. The idea is to put everything on the table so you know what to divide.\nThen later on as the divorce proceeds forward you are support to do that a second time incase you found something else. This is the final declaration of disclosure.\nThis form waives the final declaration of disclosure and would need to be signed by both parties.",
        "You need legal assistance. FL-144 is very important as it relates to the necessity of making sure each party fully and honestly disclose to each other their community and separate property claims and holdings. The form can only be used to waive what is called the Final Declaration of Disclosures and not the preliminary declarations of disclosures. If the two of you have NOT shared and exchanged your preliminary declarations, then you can't waive the final declarations. If there is any doubt about the other party's honesty and openness, then I strongly suggest that you NOT waive the final declarations of disclosure. If this is not clear, then you really should seek help from a family law attorney as this is about as simple as I can explain it.",
        "When a couple gets divorced in California, they are required to make full disclosures to each other regarding their assets, their debts, their incomes, and their budgets. This is all bundled into a packet, including exhibits (copies of bank statements, etc.) that is called a Declaration of Disclosures.\n\nEvery party is REQUIRED to sign and exchange a Preliminary Dec. of Disclosures. If there is a significant change in their circumstances, such as a new job or a change in their holdings (or debts), then they may have to also exchange a Supplemental (or \"Augmented\") Declaration of Disclosures.\n\nFinally, as the case nears trial, the parties are supposed to exchange their Final Declarations of Disclosures. If, however, the parties are settling, then this is a waste of time and effort, and they usually sign the Form FL-144 Stipulation and Waiver of Final Declaration of Disclosures, and the court will then allow them to get a judgment without exchanging Final DDs."

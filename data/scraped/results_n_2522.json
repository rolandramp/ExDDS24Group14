        "No, no, no, you do not have to pay the corporation's debts, including taxes. You would only be responsible if you took corporate assets in a dissolution instead of paying debts that existed at that time.",
        "The corporation still owes the minimum CA tax for all the years it's been in existence.",
        "Yes, your corporation is still required to file the yearly corporate tax returns, and pay taxes on the corporate income. If no taxable income, you still have to pay California the $800 minimum tax for the privilege of having a registered corporation in California. You should talk to a local qualified attorney to review your situation, and how best to proceed."

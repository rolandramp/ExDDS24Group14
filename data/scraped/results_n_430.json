    "title": "I'm being sued by 3rd party debt collector. I missed my case management hearing, now I'm facing OSC-Non Sanctions. What is that?",
    "question": "A 3rd party debt collector is suing my for $1,500.00. I submitted an answer and responded to their discovery items, I am in the process of preparing mine. I am doing all of this on my own, (I can't afford them to win by default and I cannot afford an attorney). The court scheduled a case management hearing for last Friday and I submitted my case management statement but was unable to make it to the hearing. Now it's been rescheduled and there is also \"OSC-Non Sanctions\" scheduled as well. I am trying to find out what this means. I feel so helpless, I don't know what I am doing and am so overwhelmed with all of this. I don't have it in me to continue fighting this and don't know what to do next, I know they don't have a contract and am trying to request by the discovery process that so I can get this dismissed. I just feel extremely intimidated by these attorneys and the courts and as I said, helpless. Is there any advice anyone can give me, and can someone please just explain what may happen when I go to the case management hearing. Thank you in advance.",

    "title": "How can I shelter real estate sale funds?",
    "question": "I'm in financial hardship and behind on some credit cards with one creditor already with a judgment. I want to avoid bankruptcy for now. My question is, can I sell my property and shelter the equity by placing it in my IRA, then negotiate settlement offers with my creditors to pay them off? or, are there any other ways to legally shelter equity proceeds from a property sale?",
    "question_tags": "Bankruptcy,Debt,Bankruptcy and debt",
    "answers": [
        "You can employ this strategy, but if you file bankruptcy later on, these transactions will be challenged as a \"preferential transfer,\" or an attempt to wrongfully shield assets from bankruptcy.\n\nSo, if you are committed to this, avoid bankruptcy.",
        "I agree with attorney Daymude. But I will also note that if you have a judgment against you, the judgment creditor may already have a judgment lien filed against your real estate. All the more reason for some serious pre-bankruptcy planning with an attorney.",
        "Yes, you can do pre-bankruptcy planning to move assets so that they are exempt. Consult bankruptcy counsel for assistance: making the wrong move could be very costly and may even constitute bankruptcy fraud. Timing is important.\n\nYou need to be aware that a homeowner's exemption is extremely valuable. A recorded homestead is more valuable than an unrecorded exemption because it lasts for two years after your interest in the property ceases. In many cases, you could not move enough into an IRA to make a move beneficial."

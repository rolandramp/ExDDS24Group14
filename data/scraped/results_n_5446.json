    "title": "Can you continue to add creditors to your bankruptcy if the debt occurred after you filed the bankruptcy?",
    "question": "I have read that as long as the bankruptcy is still open , you can continue to add creditors, but I have not been able to find if that is just creditors you forgot to list at the time you filed your Schedule F, or if debts occurred after you filed your bankruptcy can be included. I listed a \"possible creditor\" the opposing party in a pending lawsuit. That party prevailed, and I now want to list it as a creditor for the costs of suit. The suit was pending at the time I filed my petition -- the case just ended, and my bankruptcy is still open. Can I add that party now as a creditor -- changed from \"potential creditor?",
    "answers": [
        "You can amend the petition to add debts incurred prior to the filing of the bankruptcy petition. Once the case is closed, you would need to make a motion to reopen. If your case was a no asset case, under bankrutpcy case law, unsecured debts are considered discharged even if they werent' listed in the petition. If you are going to rely on my last sentence you should check with a bankruptcy lawyer in California to make certain that that this policy is followed there.",
        "If you are referring to a lawsuit filed prior to your filing bankruptcy, the liability may have been discharged already if someone was suing you for something that occurred prior to your filing bankruptcy. If you were suing them, and you opted to pursue the suit after you filed your bankruptcy, and the court awarded them costs, you are probably on the hook as the debt is post petition debt. You should consult with an experienced bankruptcy attorney prior to making decisions because there is incomplete information in your question here. I don't think however, it will hurt to amend your schedules to include the debt prior to your case closing as a precautionary measure.",

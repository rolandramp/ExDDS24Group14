My gf credit is bad she was thinking about filing bk all of a sudden her dad died and she received money from him which she put into my account which I added her too. My attorney asked why her money was in my account and I told him because she had been contemplating bk so she put the money in my account. Again I'm not doing bk. My attorney quit saying I'm trying to attempt bk fraud keep in mind no bk has been filed. Is it legal for him to quit keep in mind he pulled this after he didnt file paperwork for my case.",

        "The key here is disclosure. If a bankruptcy is going to be filed by gf - she must disclosed the funds as an asset that she has an interest in - even if her name is not on the account. The money is hers. If you are planning to file bk, you likewise would have to disclose the fact that there are funds in a bank account in your name. Whether you have an interest in the funds is another issue. And the amount is certainly relevant. I understand why the attorney \"quit\" particularly if he provided advice on disclosure requirements and gf and you were going to ignore that advice. If a bankruptcy is required by either of you, I urge you to consult with an experience bankruptcy attorney and fully disclose the information regarding the money gf received.",
        "The operative question is: how much money are we talking about?\nIf it's an exemptable amount ($25k or less, say) then there is no fraud in disclosing it and exempting it.",
        "I'm a little unclear as to who is filing bankruptcy - you, your girlfriend or both. But it doesn't matter because what your girl friend did was a transfer in an attempt to defraud creditors and your complicity puts a bullseye on your back too. If I were your attorney, I'd quit too because to file bankruptcy in this circumstance will get you and or your girlfriend in Federal prison for three to five years and could cause your attorney to lose his/her right to practice bankruptcy law. I practice law in Cathedral City which is not too far from Banning. Please don't come my way looking for an attorney to represent you."

    "title": "My attorney did not ask for a reaffirmation on my mortgage when I filed Chapter 7 in 2008.",
    "question": "My attorney did not ask for my mortgage to be reaffirmed when I filed for Chapter 7, 5 years ago. BofA will not report my mortgage and I cannot refi, etc because it was never affirmed. Is it worth it to reopen and if I do, does it start the bankruptcy clock ticking from Day 1 again (instead of the 5 years it has been)?",
    "answers": [
        "Reaffirmation would have made you personally liable for the mortgage debt and cancellation of debt tax liability if you ever default. Your payment history, although not on your credit report, can be proven up in other ways. Ask for a life of loan history from your loan servicer which will show the mortgage payments.",
        "I agree with attorney Scott Riddle. Mortgage lenders can make your life difficult is you don't reaffirm the loan in your bankruptcy, but the down side of signing a reaffirmation agreement on your mortgage loan could be very large.",
        "Your attorney was correct in advising you not to reaffirm your mortgage. That is no impediment to getting a refi approved with another lender or even BoA. You do not need to reopen your BK in order to get a refi. Ask BoA for an annual statement showing the amount of interest/principal payments made and show that as evidence of your timely mortgage payments to your new potential lender. The 8 year wait time between filings is from date filed to new date filed. Reopening your case does not start the 8 year period anew.",
        "The time has long since passed to reaffirm (unless your Court has an unusual local rule or practice) and it usually is a bad idea anyway."

        "I am very sorry that you are facing this horrible situation. As far as bankruptcy planning is concerned, your personal debts are contracts between you and each of the various creditors. Setting up an LLC or any other entity doesn't change the legal liability that already exists between you and each creditor.\n\nIt was a good question, and don't feel bad about not having formed an LLC to begin with. Institutional creditors will not give credit to a small business without a personal guarantee. So, you would have been on the hook anyway.",
        "If you incur debt as a sole proprietor, you remain personally liable unless you assign the debt to a newly formed entity with the consent of the creditor. That is very unlikely, if only because most creditors want a personal guarantee for debt held by a newly formed company . Further, forming a company for the sole purpose of assigning debt and filing bankruptcy is probably the kind of bad faith and deliberate under-capitalization that would warrant piercing the corporate veil and going after you personally. As for the unfulfilled contracts, they may be dischargeable as executory contracts in bankruptcy. Consult an attorney.",
        "Forming an LLC transferring the debts to it and then filing bankruptcy on the LLC will not get you off personal liability. You need to see an experienced bankruptcy attorney for a review of the facts to determine best course of action.",
        "I agree with Mr. Areshenko. You cannot form an LLC and escape personal liability. Whether you legally owe the person you did business with is too hard to tell from the facts provided. I recommend speaking with a business attorney to review the paperwork between you two and what you are legally on the hook for and whether you have any defenses.",
        "These are two separate issues.\n\nYou are not going to escape any personal liability simply by paying a small fee to the state of California to form an LLC, calling that LLC the business or otherwise shuffling some paperwork, and then having it file bankruptcy. If that were possible everybody would just do that.\n\nAs to your dispute with your business associate, that will require an in-depth review of the facts and details of the situation. Hire a business attorney which frankly should have been done before you ever started doing business with these people."

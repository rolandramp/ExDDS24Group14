        "The length of separation can complicate matters if the case is contested. I have had matters come before me where the parties had already had a trial just on the issue of date of separation (when on spouse tells the other that the marriage is over). It's a matter of proof and has such a huge impact on a number of important issues. If you have both pretty much separated all of your assets and debts and are happy with the arrangement, there's no reason you should have to go to court. Many issues can be resolved through discussion, then all you need is to file the necessary paper work. I don't recommend that you do this alone. In order to make an informed decision as to how to resolve your divorce issues, even after having been separated for so long, you need an attorney to advise you. You will both also have make the legally required financial disclosures. Again, all of this can be done without having to spend one day in the courthouse. It really is up to you both. If you would like more information, you can visit my web site at www.wcmediate.com.",
        "If you have resided in California for at least 6 months, and the county in which you are filing for 3 months, you may file you dissolution action in California. If you ex is in Florida, he cannot get jurisdiction in California unless he lives here.\n\nUnless Florida allows a non resident citizen to file, your only option is to file here in California. You ex may be able to file in Florida against you. I think it would be better to get jurisdiction close to home where you live don't you?\n\nThere are no breaks for length of seperation. You still have to go through the process. I do family law in your area. For a free consultation give me a call at 818-584-8831 ext. 1.\n\nNorm"

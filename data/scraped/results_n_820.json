        "I agree with the prior answers that there is no Chapter 5 bankruptcy. However, a possible remedy is to hire a bankruptcy attorney and file a motion for relief from stay for the divorce case to be completed. Generally, these motions are granted for family law matters if the automatic stay is affecting them.",
        "There is no \"Chapter 5\" within the bankruptcy Code. The \"chapters\" are a reference to the subsection of Title 11. The subsection 5 contains general provisions that apply to all chapters and are related to case administration. Chapter 7 bankruptcies are generally liquidations while a Chapter 13 or Chapter 11 are re-organizations (repayment).",
        "Chapter 5 is not a form of bankruptcy. Chapter 5 of the bankruptcy code basically lays down some ground rules. I'm not sure why the debt in your wife's name delayed the finalizing the divorce. I suggest you consult with a bankruptcy attorney for direction regarding the debt and your liability and also consult with your divorce attorney.",
        "As the attorneys have stated, there is not chapter 5, you are probably referring to Section 541, which identifies property that is part of a bankruptcy estate. If your spouse filed a chapter 7 bankruptcy, all of the community property becomes part of the bankruptcy estate and if you are in a divorce proceeding the division of property is stayed until the bankruptcy trustee has time to review the schedules and make sure there is no community property to seize and sell for the benefit of creditors, or the bankruptcy is discharged. The divorce can go ahead as to the division of the people, you are no longer husband and wife, and child support and custody issues. Very important to note that this is why anyone divorcing should seek out a knowledgeable bankruptcy attorney to find out what the ramifications are if one or the other parties files a bankruptcy within 4 years of the division of the property. The bankruptcy trustee can look back to undo 'unfair' property divisions and most Marital Settlement Agreements do not establish how the property division is fair. The Family Law Court will only delay the property division. The issues of child support, custody and decree which states you are no longer husband and wife can go forward.",
        "There are 4 types of bankruptcy you might see -- Chapters 7, 11, 12, and 13. A Chapter 12 is for farmers and fishers, so probably not your spouse. A Chapter 11 is generally for corporations or other people with massive debts and/or income. Chapter 7 is the most common and involves a discharge of almost all unsecured debts (except student loans and some taxes) and personal liability on secured debts. Chapter 13 involves a repayment plan of up to 5 years. In the case of a divorce pending when the bankruptcy is filed, child custody and support proceedings can continue as can the divorce; however, distribution of property proceedings must stop.",
        "I am changing the category of this question, but any bankruptcy involves a stay.

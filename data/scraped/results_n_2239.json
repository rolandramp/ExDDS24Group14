        "If they continue to garnish you after the judgment has been satisfied in full, that is a violation of the Rosenthal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. Also, if you were not properly served with the lawsuit, you could set it aside and get the monies garnished back.",
        "Considering that your wages were garnished, the HOA probably holds a judgment against you for the period that you owned the property and did not pay. Were you aware that the HOA filed a lawsuit against you? Were you served with a lawsuit? If you were not served or if the service was defective, you may be able to set the judgment aside. You probably want to get a full consultation from a local bankruptcy/debt collection defense attorney. Most attorneys provide some type of an initial free limited consultation.",
        "This appears to have been filed as a lawsuit, which is now a money judgment for the full balance, plus accrued interest, court costs, and probably attorney's fees. Until the judgment creditor (either your former HOA or their collection agency) files a satisfaction of judgment in full, you will continue to be obligated for the unsatisfied judgment, which continues to accrue interest, court costs, and probably attorney's fees. Consult either a debt collection defense attorney or a bankruptcy attorney.",

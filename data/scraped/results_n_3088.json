        "You must respond within 30 or 40 days or you may be subject to default judgment. Depending on nature of lawsuit, one of t20 following forms can be used: (1) Answer Contract (PLD-C010) and (2) General Denial (PLD-050).",
        "There is a strict time limit to file a response in court of 30 days from date of the service of the summons and complaint, be sure to file the response early, or a default judgment can result soon after. There may be extensions of this time limit and it may be 40 days if substitute served, but be safe and file early. If you are not indigent, the clerk of the court will also expect to receive the payment for first appearance fees from each named defendant appearing at that time.\n\nThere are two forms that may apply in your case: (1) Answer Contract (PLD-C010) and (2) General Denial (PLD-050). See link below to the forms so you can find these forms and print them for free. The fact that you can complete the forms, serve them using a friend or relative who is not a party and over age 18, and file them with the clerk of the court does not mean that they will help avoid a judgment against you later in the case, but it will do the trick for the short term. Use only one of the forms. These forms are easy to use but do not admit anything in your response, or this will probably make it more difficult for your case later, even if you hire an attorney. I suggest you contact and hire a debt collection DEFENSE attorney. A judgment can result, even if you use the correct form and pay the filing fee.\n\nBy: Robert Stempler (please see DISCLAIMER below)\nCONSUMER LAW OFFICE OF ROBERT STEMPLER\nA Professional Law Corporation",

        "Sure, you can serve a day or two before filing. The problem is if it's the other way around. The thing about serving and then filing a day later is you wake up the next day and want to make changes to the document you already served. That isn't fatal, because you can just serve the updated copy.",

        "I agree with my colleague, you can certainly serve before and then file, just make sure the date on your proof of service is correct. What you should not do is file your documents with a certain date on the proof of service and then fail to serve on that date identified in your proof of service. That is a big problem."

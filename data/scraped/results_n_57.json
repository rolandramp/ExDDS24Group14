        "You've received a number of excellent answers and I agree with all of them. Yes, a judgment credit can put a lien on your home. Chapter 13 does give you the ability to propose plan that could get you caught up on the mortgage and reduce/eliminate you debts, You should consult a bankruptcy attorney to discuss the best bankruptcy option for you.",
        "I agree with both of my distinguished colleagues. You need to retain an experienced CA Bankruptcy attorney to represent you and protect your interests. THIS IS NOT LEGAL ADVICE! YOU NEED TO SPEAK TO AN ATTORNEY WHO IS LICENSED IN YOUR STATE FOR LEGAL ADVICE. This is merely suggestions for you to think about in discussing your situation with the local attorney.",
        "I fully concur with atty Markus' response. Bankruptcy is an excellent option for your situation. As an added bonus, some or all of the attorney fees can be paid thru the Chapter 13 Plan so you won't need a sizeable \"out of pocket\" deposit for a good attorney to get started.\n\nRemember, BK is more than checking boxes on forms you find online. Find/consult/hire a lawyer in your area using the Avvo feature \"Find a Lawyer\". Make a list of 4-5 having many 5 star reviews from satisfied clients. If you don't get a prompt call back from one, go on to the next on your list. Some offer a free consultation by phone or in person. Take us up on it.\n\nBecause the bankruptcy process can be handled entirely by phone, email and fax, there is no need to personally visit the lawyer’s office unless you want to. Don’t be limited by the location of the BK lawyers you select.\n\nAccording to statistics reported by the United States Trustee, virtually all non-lawyer 13s are dismissed before completion, including many that fail to even get confirmed. If you want to avoid becoming one of these statistics, please get a lawyer to help you. Good luck and God bless. You can get through this.",
        "Q1: Yes, after judgment they can put a lien on any real estate you own, and also seize your bank accounts.\nQ2: Chapter 13 will enable you to catch up on your mortgage payments over time (36-60 months) while also enabling you to deal with the unsecured credit card debt. The percentage you would have to pay depends on your budget, the value of your assets, and amounts of all debts. You should schedule a consultation with a qualified bankruptcy attorney in your state."

        "You very likely would enjoy a big benefit from consulting a bankruptcy lawyer. BK tends to be pretty complicated and it takes a person with the right experience, software and skilled staff to actually assemble a big picture perspective on whatever options might work best for you.\n\nYour issue involves substantial monetary claims. Debt relief can constitute ordinary income. You might wind up with a big surprise at tax time. Don't make any quick moves without your accountant or tax attorney's review and recommendations.",
        "Judgments in California are good for 10 years and can be renewed anytime before the 10 years expires so just because nothing has happened yet doesn't mean it won't and you're right in thinking it can happen any time. Even if you don't sell the house they can record the lien against the other real estate property. Are you sure they haven't already done that? Check county records.",
        "I absolutely agree with the prior poster. A bankruptcy attorney would be able to assist you with a plan to manage the debt through a bankruptcy filing or, perhaps, otherwise. While the creditors are sleeping on their rights, it is never a good idea to put your head in the sand and just wait. By formulating a plan, even if you wait a while to put into action, at least you will have an idea of what is coming and what can happen.\n\nAs far as the creditors doing something, let sleeping dogs lie?",
        "If you have not consulted a Bankruptcy lawyer, you should. And you should before you pay a single dollar on that $18,000 judgment. In consultation with a BK attorney, who becomes thoroughly familiar with your situation, you can develop a plan of action that might save you untold $s."

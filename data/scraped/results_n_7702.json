        "All assets and debts incurred during the marriage are presumed community assets...debts. However, a credit card you did not sign for will likely not try to collect against you. You wrote a lot of detail so I am sorry I cannot review and address all of your facts, but if you come in I can offer a half hour free consultation. If your husband can afford an attorney you should have one as well. You may be able to get the court to have your husband pay your attorney."

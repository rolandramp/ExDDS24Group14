I was ordered to pay victim restitution in a previous case, he declined, and is now suing me through civil court for over $50,000. I was also sentenced to jail, did my time, and now on probation. If he wins, would I be able to file for bankruptcy.",

        "You can file for bankruptcy protection before, during, or after a civil lawsuit is filed against you, and that filing would \"stay\" (stop) a lawsuit against you and any attempts to collect. If the personal injury is based on negligence, you can get this liability discharged.\n\nBut since apparently there's some kind of criminal restitution order in effect, the liability is probably NOT dischargeable through bankruptcy, and you'll still be liable for it. The kinds of non-dischargeable debts include debts from injuries caused driving while intoxicated or under the influence of drugs, for debts based on fraudulent acts, debts from willful or malicious injury to another person or another person's property, debts from embezzlement, larceny, or breach of trust , etc. etc.\n\nSee a bankruptcy lawyer to fully disclose the facts of your situation.\n\nDisclaimer: Please note that this answer does not constitute legal advice, and should not be relied on, since each state has different laws, each situation is fact specific, and it is impossible to evaluate a legal problem without a comprehensive consultation and review of all the facts and documents at issue. This answer does not create an attorney-client relationship.",
        "Yes",
        "You can file bankruptcy and may wind up still paying the debt, if it is not dischargeable because the other side proves that the harmful act was intentional or fraudulent. You need to first find out if the incident is covered by any of your insurance policies, so that you can try to get a good defense attorney to help you determine your best move and defend the lawsuit to keep the amount fair to all concerned, perhaps even pay to settle. If this was a motor vehicle accident, you should contact a good defense attorney so that he or she can begin assisting you to see if it may be covered by any of your policies. I don't handle such cases.",
        "You should consult with a BK attorney to determine what kind of BK you can file for, and whether he could force them to bring the action in the BK court or whether relief from stay would be granted."

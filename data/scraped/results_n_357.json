    "title": "Estranged husband is filing for bankruptcy and sent me a spousal waiver form to sign. Does signing this keep me out of it?",
    "question": "I am legally married to someone, we have not been together in over 2 years and are essentially estranged from each other and just have not gotten around to getting a legal divorce. He reached out to me today letting me know he needs to file for bankruptcy and sent me a form to sign \"so he can file separately\". It is titled as a \"spousal waiver\" form and I am just looking for clarification on what exactly this form does for me? Does signing this say I have nothing to do with this so I wont be effected when he files? We have NO joint debts or anything of that sort. Thank you!",

        "Your Waiver simply says that during the pendency of his BK, you are agreeing not to use the same CA exemptions in a BK of your own. The exemptions he wants to use protects more than $30k of his (and community) property; so it's usually in both of your interests to enable him to exempt that property.\nIf, however, there is community property with equity exceeding the exemptions, you have been well-advised by Mr Gorrill to seek more advice from an attorney.",
        "I agree with the attorney above. Non-debtors that are married to a debtor (the person who files bankruptcy) can be affected by the bankruptcy filing. Depending on what chapter your \"ex\" files, a trustee or other professional with a fiduciary duty to administer the estate may inquire into your assets and financial status. In many cases it is not as simple as stating that you and the debtor have been estranged and therefore you have nothing to do with his bankruptcy case. But, that may accurate for your case, but a qualified bankruptcy practitioner should be consulted to help you analyze these issues and the request for you to sign any documents. Best of luck to you.",
        "If you sign the spousal waiver you are only acknowledging you are aware your ex-spouse filed a bankruptcy, and if you should file your own bankruptcy later on, you will use the same set of exemptions your ex-spouse is using in his case. If things are bad enough for your EX to file bankruptcy, you should consider consulting with an attorney to see if you have any exposure. You said no joint debts, but you didn't mention if you jointly own any property. ALL community property will become property of his bankruptcy case and might be sold by the bankruptcy trustee, so it is a good idea to consult with a bankruptcy attorney."

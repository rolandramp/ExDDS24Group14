    "title": "I sold a property on an AITD a few years ago and the buyer is now filing a Ch 13 BK -- I worry I might be \"crammed down.\"",
    "question": "I sold a property at the top of the market on a wrap around mortgage where about $20K was a down payment. Property has dropped $50K and so the buyer (and me as the AITD holder) is upside down about $30K. Payments have not been made for six months from buyer and underlying mortgage has not been paid (payments go into a trust account and are not paid unless buyer pays). Presumably buyer wishes to retain the property with this filing, but I would still like to keep some control of the purchase transaction under the terms of the AITD because the mortgages are obviously still in my name.",

        "The owner's bk will not discharge your obligation on the mortgage. You have to file your own bankruptcy to do that. If the owner files a motion/action to value the property and shows your lien is fully unsecured, then your debt becomes unsecured and shares with the other unsecured debtors on funds paid through the chapter 13. So your only way to keep control is to fight the motion, but that doesn't sound viable either. In some districts you keep your mortgage until the plan is completed. That way if the debtor converts to chapter 7 or gets his case dismissed the cram down is incomplete and ineffective. Good luck."

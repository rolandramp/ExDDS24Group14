    "question": "My boyfriend is filing Chapter 7 with his soon-to-be ex-spouse (result of a job loss & house under water). Prior to marriage, I plan to have a prenup (I own my home, am financially stable). Besides a prenup, are there other legal or tax concerns I should be prepared for? We plan to keep our assets separate for obvious reasons, We both work. I will be contacting my attorney after his Ch7 and divorce are finalized to start the prenup but I am thinking ahead.",

        "I agree with my colleagues that, assuming you wait until after his Ch7 has discharged and his case closed, you are taking a good tack on these issues. Without know more about both your and your intendeds legal and financial situations we cannot warn you about anything with specificity, but be sure to discuss any concerns you may have with your attorney when you start the pre-nup process.",
        "Assuming you both wait for his discharge to be granted and case closed before any adversary proceedings are filed against him, and assuming he has not committed any type of fraud where as his case could be reopened, then waiting till after is perfect and smart both. Great thinking too...as I am sure many persons WISH they did as you are!",
        "Unless he had non dischargeable debts, when his bankruptcy concludes, he may be in better financial shape than you. Community property laws do not make you responsible for debts that predate your marriage. Hope this perspective helps.",
        "If you are both willing to agree to a pre-nup agreement, make sure to add a provision that all debts that exist pre-marriage are the separate debts of the individuals, are not community debts, and that neither party nor the community assumes any liability for pre-marriage debts of the other spouse. That will most likely protect you against any debts that survive the BK process (which they may not e.g. student loans, child support, etc.) but it is a good precaution that should protect you and any community property later acquired.\n\nFeedback is important to all of the attorneys on Avvo as it is the only way we know whether our answers were effective in resolving your question.

        "Once he receives his discharge, his debts are forgiven! At that point you can get married without fear his debts will come back to haunt you. There are certain debts that are non-dischargeable (child support, spousal support, some tax debt, etc.) which he would still owe. You'll want to understand what the result of his divorce is."

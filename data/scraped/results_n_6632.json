    "title": "My HOA has sent my account to a collection agency.",
    "question": "The statement is incorrect as we have several HOA Property Managers since I went deliquent. My regular assessments do not total $1800, however, the collection is trying to say that I am over that amount and that they added finance charges to the regular assessment about. I have disputed the statement and only heard back from them once. Correcting the statement, however, it's still incorrect and they have also overcharged me $300.00. How do I get this fixed. I don't want them to foreclose on my condo due to an accounting error. In the meantime, I am beginning to pay my HOA dues again, I have been out of work for 9 months.",

        "Keep in mind that you owe more than just the unpaid dues - late fees (typically 10% per annum but look at your bylaws to see what your stated rate is), collection costs, filing with the credit bureaus, lien filing, and any other legal fees associated with the account are also charged to you and need to be paid to the HOA.\n\nIt sounds like you have established a payment plan with the HOA. Make sure that you have a copy of the terms of your payment plan in writing. Then stick to them! You can also see if they are willing to settle for less than due if you pay it off in one lump sum. Getting a credit card and charging 1000 right away to settle your account in full is much less painful for everyone and less painful then risking your house if you feel that you could stay current with the HOA after paying off your back dues.",
        "In California, HOAs are governed by the Davis-Stirling Common Interest Development Act. HOAs are allowed to record a lien but may not start foreclosure until the delinquent assessment is at least $1,800 or the delinquency is at least 12 months old pursuant to California Civil Code section 1367.4(b)(2).\n\nHomeowners have a duty to pay their HOA dues assessments. California Civil Code ยง1367.1(a) provides as follows:\n\n\"A regular or special assessment and any late charges, reasonable fees and costs of collection, reasonable attorney's fees, if any, and interest, if any, as determined in accordance with Section 1366, shall be a debt of the owner of the separate interest at the time the assessment or other sums are levied.\"\n\nHomeowners may dispute any assessment by submitting a written request for dispute resolution to the association (Civil Code section 1365.1(b)) in accordance with the HOA's internal dispute resolution procedures, or filing an action in small claims court for any amount up to $10,000 ($5,000 if the owner is a corporation). (Civil Code section 1367.6.)\n\nIf the parties elect Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR), the parties must complete ADR within 90 days after the party initiating the request receives the acceptance, unless this period is extended by written stipulation signed by both parties.

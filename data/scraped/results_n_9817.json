    "question": "in 1998 filed for bankruptcy and had my credit card debts discharged. i have been receiving a notice about once or twice a year from Global Rated Asset Trust, serviced by NCO Financial Systems that i assumed was for my current mortgage lender and credit card issuer checking on my credit status. but i got curious about it when i received the most recent one, and called them. it turns out that it is from one of the credit card companies that i had my debt discharged with. the back of the notice says that it is an attempt to collect a debt by a debt collector. can you give me any insight to why they are checking my credit still, and if this is legal? my bankruptcy was in California where i still reside.",

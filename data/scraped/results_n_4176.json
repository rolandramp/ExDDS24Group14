    "title": "Are parents responsible for adult child's medical bills?",
    "question": "Are parent's responsible for their adult child's (47) medical bills? He has been living with them the past year due to financial problems and plans on filing for bankruptcy. He has been in the hospital for the past three weeks and was in for about three weeks a couple of months ago. He has no insurance.",
    "answers": [
        "In general - no, unless you signed a personal guarantee.",
        "Essentially a parent is not responsible for an adult son's medical bills. However, one of the parents may have signed a guarantee. This happened to me once. I rushed to a hospital where my daughter was. I was under stress and apparently I signed documents without realizing it. And I am a lawyer.",
        "A normal 47 year old is not a child. Generally speaking, a normal 47 year old man is responsible for his own medical bills, unless someone signed an agreement to take responsibility for his debts, obligations and welfare. If possible, the man should apply for governmental aid to assist with the medical bills. In addition, the man should consult with a Bankruptcy Attorney to find out if bankruptcy is a viable option. Good luck."

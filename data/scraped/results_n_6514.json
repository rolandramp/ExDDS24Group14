    "title": "Am I legally responsible for medical bills incurred by my ex wife after the date of separation if she is on my medical insurance",
    "question": "We have been separated for almost a year, and I filed for divorce in June in California. She is on my employer sponsored health insurance until the divorce is final in December. Recently she incurred a large hospital bill, and I know the insurance will not pay the entire bill. Since we have been separated, isn't she responsible for any charges the insurance will not pay?",
    "answers": [
        "You are each liable for your own debts incurred after you have separated legally.\n\nBW",
        "After the \"date of separation\" each spouse is responsible for his/her own debts. California Family Code 910. Debt collectors like to refer to the date when the divorce is final, but they are wrong.\n\nDo not make any promises to pay. If you do file for divorce, make sure that the Petition for Dissolution correctly lists the date of separation.",
        "She would be responsible for any charges post filingof the Complaint."

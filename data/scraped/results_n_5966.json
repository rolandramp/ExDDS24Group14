    "question": "An investigator called me saying someone was trying to use my social security he gave me the last six digits of my social and said i needed to report it to equiafax an do an initial alert. but he then asked for my employers information. He just said that he would keep in contact.. i found it weird that he was just an investigator not with a police department he was out of state and had my info.. he called my mom's number instead of mine. i have a default car loan and thought it could be the agency trying to garnish my wages again. i just recently started working at this new place.",

        "If this is a debt collector or someone working for a debt collector, who is lying about who he is or the nature of the call, and not disclosing that he is trying to collect a debt, is violating the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA) for contacting third parties, misrepresenting the nature of the call, not disclosing that all information is used to collect a debt, and not disclosing that he is a debt collector. The FDCPA permits recovery of the consumer's actual damages, reasonable attorney's fees, and court costs, plus up to $1000 for statutory damages.\n\nIf this is someone not related to a debt collector than really watch out, as perhaps it is an attempt to get more of your personal information, to steal what little credit you can obtain or use it for other illegal purposes. Be sure to warn your employer and your family not to disclose any personal information about you, if someone calls asking and to simply hang up and to not contact them again.

    "title": "When mailing a copy of the default judgement to the defendant, is it mandatory to also send the declaration?",
    "question": "I have been instructed by the Judge that I will need to file a default judgement (form CIV-100) that also includes the declaration. I know that unless I mail a copy of the default judgement to the defendant, he may have grounds to have a \"Motion to Set Aside Default Judgement\" filed in court. But I'm not sure if I need to also send the declaration, (form MC-030) along with it.",

        "You only need to serve the Request for Entry of Default form; but you need to make sure that the form is completely and correctly filled out",
        "you are only required to serve the completed request for default/default judgment form.",
        "No, it is not mandatory that you, also, send Judicial Council form MC-030 (\"Declaration\"). You only need to mail the defendant a copy of Judicial Council form CIV-100. (Just remember that said form is a 2-paged document; so make sure to mail both pages.)",
        "The Request for Default Judgment Judicial Council form must be fully completed, including the declaration on the back, or the clerk will probably reject it when you try to file it. Form MC-030 is a blank declaration and is not needed if you complete Form CIV-100. If you are a party, then you cannot serve this, you must have someone else mail it and sign the Proof of Service section. If the defendant was not served, you need to have proper service of the Summons and Complaint at least 30 days before seeking a default judgment.\n\nRobert Stempler (please see DISCLAIMER below)\nwww.StopCollectionLawsuits.com\nwww.facebook.com/SoCalConsumerLawyer\nTwitter: @RStempler"

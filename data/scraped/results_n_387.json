    "title": "Is it legal for a debt collector to do this?",
    "question": "I received a letter from a debt collector with the following language: \"At this time, no attorney has personally reviewed the particular circumstances of your account. However, if you fail to contact us and make arrangements to pay your account, this matter will be returned to our client who may then forward it to a local attorney for the purposes of filing suit.\" So, do I have a Fair Debt complaint or can they say this?",

    "answers": [
        "I don't see a particular violation with that statement. You can send them a debt validation letter in which they will have to inform you of who the original creditor was and the amount of the debt. Hope this helps.",
        "Depending on your overall financial situation, Bankruptcy may be right for you. An experienced CA Bankruptcy attorney will be able to determine which type of Bankruptcy, if any is the correct one for you. Use AVVO's Find a Lawyer tool to select a qualified attorney. Good luck. THIS IS NOT LEGAL ADVICE! YOU NEED TO SPEAK TO AN ATTORNEY WHO IS LICENSED IN YOUR STATE FOR LEGAL ADVICE. This is merely suggestions for you to think about in discussing your situation with the local attorney.",
        "That can say that. You have a right to debt validation. Use it.",
        "Do you recognize the debt? It could be a scam. If it is not however, I don’t see a violation."

    "question": "I'm 19 years old never been in trouble, no record. I worked for akmart. I received free nachos from a Co worker (stupid me!) Any way they also accused me of not paying for a few other things.

Now I received a letter demanding $405.49??? What's going on??? Do I pay?? Does this go on my record?? What happens if I don't pay? I'm very scared and need advice!",

        "What you received was a \"civil demand letter.\" There is a statute (Penal Code 490.5) that allows a merchant to sue someone in civil court for costs incurred in a shoplifting incident. This is a civil procedure, not a criminal prosecution.\n\nNeal C. Tenen and his \"Civil Demand Associates\" has a regular business sending out civil demand letters. Since February, 2008, they have sent out more than 145,000 such letters, demanding $56 million and collecting $13.5 million. These are form letters sent out in an automated process, without any sort of investigation. During this time, the total number of civil lawsuits filed by CDA and Mr. Tenen is a total of exactly zero. zero of 145,000.\n\nBecause this is not a \"consumer debt\" covered by the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, you cannot sue Mr. Tenen for violation of the fair debt collection laws. However, it might be possible to sue under other legal theories.",

        "A civil demand letter does not create an independent obligation to pay unless if is followed by a civil lawsuit which almost never happens."

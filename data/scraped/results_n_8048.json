    "title": "How to deal with credit card debt after death?",
    "question": "My spouse recently passed away with credit card debt in excess of 50k and not much assets. I am wondering, do I personally have to pay those credit card debts? I went online, and some seemed to say yes, and others no. I am in California, which I think is a community property state. Any tips or suggestions?",
    "answers": [
        "First, are you contractually liable for any of the credit card debts? If your husband and you applied for the credit cards using your joint credit (applied for jointly), then both of you are liable for the debt. If one of you does not pay the debt, the other of you remains liable for the entire debt.\nSecond, are you liable for the debt as a result receiving assets from him? Ignoring jointly held accounts and accounts on which you were designated as the pay on death beneficiary, if he had any assets in his separate name and you were able to acquire those by using a \"Small Estates Affidavit\" pursuant to Probate Code Section 13100, then you are liable for his debts to the extent of the value of assets you received.\nThird, are you liable for the debt due to you legal obligations to provide you spouse with basic necessities of life? So if some of the credit card debt was incurred to purchase food or provide medical care, it is arguable that you are liable on the debt to the extent the cards were used for that purpose. But the reality is that a credit card issuer is unlikely to bother sorting out the purposes of the purchase, so it is unlikely this will ever come back to haunt you.\n\nHope this helps\nDISCLAIMER: This posting is provided only for general educational purposes only, and nothing herein should be interpreted as legal provided to anyone in particular.

        "Under community property laws, spouses are responsible for paying for the other's necessities, which would include medical debts. Credit card bills usually do not fall into this category, so unless you jointly applied for the account, as a spouse, I do not believe you are responsible for paying the debt.\n\nHaving done some probate work in the past, I can say that probate can eliminate debt for a person who has died. As long as there is something that can be put into the probate, such as a bank account or vehicle that was only held in your spouse's name, probate could be a fairly easy way to resolve this debt issue.\n\nProbate always gets a bad name, but it can be very helpful in this kind of situation.

        "You should consult with a probate attorney to see if her estate can or should be probated, which may relieve you of some or all of these debts, if paid or discharged through the probate process.\n\nProbate the the legal process by which assets and debts are accounted by the executor or administrator (the process is commonly known as to \"marshal\" the property and liabilities of the decedent's estate), so that only the assets are distributed to the beneficiaries or heirs, and you are not stuck paying her debts.\n\nI don't handle probate, but please check on Avvo.com's \"find a lawyer\" tab for probate attorneys in your area. Without probate, then any beneficiaries of the estate property will likely be contacted to pay the debts. Also, under community property, if the debts were incurred during marriage, then you may likely be liable for the debts, though your name was not on them. It will depend on what the debts were and whether you knew she was incurring such debts, or if these were secret accounts that you discovered she had after she died.\n\nRobert Stempler\nwww.StopCollectionLawsuits.com"

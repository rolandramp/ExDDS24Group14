        "I agree that you should contact an attorney if you are above the means test. However, if you still choose to go at it alone, add up all the taxes you have listed in your question for all your pay stubs received within the 6 months prior to filing. Then, divide that number by 6 and that is your average taxes paid on a monthly basis for line 30 in the means test.\n\nIf you owe income tax on your tax return, divide the amount you owe by 12 and add that to the figure you got from your paystubs. That is the total average monthly expense that you actually incur fro all taxes.",
        "I add up all the taxes from last year and divide by 12, including SDI. I second the above advice. Don't file without an attorney if you're above median.\n\nRob",
        "If you are an above median debtor you should not try to file bankruptcy without an attorney.",
        "For Means Test deduction, you should use 1/12 of your tax liability from your tax return. Medical expenses should also be taken as a deduction on top of tax liability."

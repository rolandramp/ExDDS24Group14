        "Bifurcation refers to the dissolution of marriage process where the State court separates the actual dissolution of the marriage from the resolution of property issues which are dealt with later on.",
        "Chapter 7 Bankruptcy normally only lasts about thirty days from filing date to discharge date, then the case is closed. So it is a small window of time. I am not aware of any restriction for a couple who wants to separate, file for dissolution or divorce, etc., to obtain court permission. But review with your attorney before doing anything.",
        "If you want to divorce after you file a Chapter, you may do so. However, the divorce court cannot decide who gets what assets and pays what debts until your Chapter 7 is complete or you ask for permission (relief from stay / asset abandonment) in the Chapter 7. But, Chapter 7's typically last only three months. So, to save some money, you might start all the divorce prep work now but file it after the 7 is complete.",
        "What you are asking for may be possible, but it isn't necessary. Here's why.\n\nWhen you are your spouse filed a joint bankruptcy, you were actually both in two separate bankruptcies that were jointly adminstrated. She has her debt; you have your debts; two bankruptcy estates were created, completely separate from one another. It's the same as filing a joint tax returns: there are actually two separate returns filed, with amounts owed to the respective spouses. We file joint bankruptcy and joint taxes because it is faster and easier for the government to administer them.

        "It is unclear what you are asking. Bifurcate isn't a word typically applied to marriage within the context of bankruptcy. Bifurcating typically applies to a court case, not a relationship. Hope this perspective helps!",
        "Yes, I think there is a word for bifurcating a marriage -- divorce."

        "Your husband is eligible to stay in the US and apply for legal permanent resident status. However, he must have proof of his entry with a visa. It should be stamped in his passport, and he should have a little white card called an I-94 in the passport. These things are worth more than gold to him. They are what he needs to stay in the US and adjust his status based on his marriage to you.\n\nIt is best to consult with an immigration lawyer before you begin this process. My office gives free consulations, which can be done telephonically. However, no matter who you consult with, you should have the passport and I-94 available, as well as information about the place and date or your marriage, and details about prior marriages either of you may have, also about any arrrests, charges or convictions your husband may have suffered. The more complete your information, the more useful the consultation.\n\nLamar Peckham\nLaw Office of Lamar Peckham\n555 Sebastopol Rd., Ste.

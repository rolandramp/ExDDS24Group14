        "This works out in the accounting on distribution. The debtor beneficiaries are treated as if their amounts are added to the trust, divided by 4 and then the debts are subtracted from the debtors' shares. For example, if the trust has $100,000 now and each debtor owes $20,000, the total available for distribution would be $140,000. Divided by 4 is $35,000 each. The debtor beneficiaries' share would be deducted by $20,000, so they would each get $15,000. The math works as 2 beneficiaries get net $35,000, and 2 get net $15,000, totalling $100,000, which is the cash on hand for distribution. The debtor beneficiaries get credit for their distributive share of 1/4 of the debt each."

        "Did the court, i.e., the judge enter a formal order awarding attorney's fees? A court order is something decided by a judge. If the judge has entered such an order, you can obtain a certified copy and record it. However, I suspect that you are asking because the court has not actually entered an order. If you want to file a motion asking that the court award your attorney's fees, your attorney should prepare and file the motion or application for the order. If you are representing yourself, without an attorney, on what basis do you claim attorney's fees. If you are not an attorney, and you do not have an attorney, you cannot recover attorney's fees.",
        "Yes you need to have a final judgment entered or an order directing execution and an abstract be issued on it.\n\nRecording the order itself probably will not do anything. The court may require you to move to enforce payment before issuing execution, final judgment or an abstract.\n\nSome family rules permit a different form of order."

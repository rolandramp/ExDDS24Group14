    "question": "If a marriage petition is denied after the 2nd interview/stoke interview, is it automatically considered \"unreal\" marriage? Do we have to go to the court after that or what is the process?",
    "answers": [
        "My experience in the Baltimore district is quite different. Once the I-130 is denied, you need to file an appeal with the Board of Immigration Appeals within 30 days of the denial as the USCIS office will refer the case to the Immigration Judge and a Notice to Appear will be issued. When you get to court, you then need to ask the judge for a continuance while the appeal is pending. There is no de novo review in the court. In fact, the court has no obligation to give you a continuance. The court also has no obligation to allow you time to refile the I-130.",
        "Once you have been denied, they will send you a letter explaining why you were denied. The next step, the case might be sent to an immigration court for a \"de novo\" review. This means that it is not an appeal but a review under removal proceedings. You can present your case in front of a judge. I will highly recommend that you have a good attorney review the case immediately. Sometimes if the referral to the court is delayed, you might want to refile the entire case with more proof or file for a Motion to Reoppen.

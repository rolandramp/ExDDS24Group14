    "question": "A small claims judgment was sold to a collection agency. I have paid the judgment in full. I requested an Acknowledgment of Satisfaction of Judgment be recorded. Now the collection company wants me to prove the judgment is paid in full. I have the cancelled checks; however, why is it necessary that I prove payment in full? Incidentally, the last check had \"paid in full\" written in the memo but the collections agency drew a line through it.",

        "It's not clear from your post whether you voluntarily paid the judgment or whether it was paid via a writ of execution. In California, a judgment debtor who has voluntarily satisfied a civil monetary judgment can file motion to compel entry of satisfaction of judgment pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure § 724.050. Code of Civil Procedure § 724.030 provides as follows:\n\n“When a money judgment is satisfied, the judgment creditor immediately shall file with the court an acknowledgment of satisfaction of judgment. This section does not apply where the judgment is satisfied in full pursuant to a writ.”\n\nWhen a judgment creditor refuses or fails to do so, the judgment debtor can file a motion pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure § 724.050(d)(2), which reads:\n\n“(d) If the judgment creditor does not comply with the demand [to the judgment debtor to execute, acknowledge, and deliver an acknowledgement of satisfaction of judgment] within the time allowed, the person making the demand may apply to the court on noticed motion for an order requiring the judgment creditor to comply with the demand. The notice of motion shall be served on the judgment creditor. Service shall be made personally or by mail. If the court determines that the judgment has been satisfied and that the judgment creditor has not complied with the demand, the court shall either (1) order the judgment creditor to comply with the demand or (2) order the court clerk to enter satisfaction of the judgment.”",

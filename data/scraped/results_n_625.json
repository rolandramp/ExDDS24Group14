    "question": "I've been married for 8 months and am contemplating filing Chapter 7. We are still residents of CA, but, have been in OH for work. My partner purchased a home in OH. I have $265k debt (student loan and unsecured bad debt) from before we were married. I don't want him to suffer adverse actions or have his property title involved. How should I go about doing this? (I'm waiting for an atty consult).",

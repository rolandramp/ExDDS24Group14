    "title": "I was demoted at work , what happens to my spousal support ?",
    "question": "I was making good money, as sr. manager in a techology company, i have been paying spousal support for the last 4 years. Now, the salary is down by 40%, but I am working in the same group under the same boss. The reasons for the demotion is that I am not delivering/performing well. It is true as I am focussing more on the never ending divorce case, though I never intended to ignore my work as it is the only source for the entire family. Lots of debts, even stress, the ex (soon to be, hopefully ) somehow avoids to work.. now how do I handle the situation ?",
    "answers": [
        "File a request for order asap, because the orders will be retroactive. You need to not only show that the pay has gone down, but have proof that you were demoted. You need to also be asking that your spouse to some job contacts, and possibly you should look at getting an attorney, maybe on a limited scope, to impute income to her. I have done this in the San Jose courts, and its a job to do, so you need to have all your ducks in a row.\n\nThe stress of the divorce etc. may irritate the judge, so you might not want to play the blame game.",
        "You are probably entitled to a modification of support based on your reduced income. Perhaps you should also consider a bankruptcy. Although no one is happy about the prospect, if you are entitled to bankruptcy and struggling with a lot of debt, it may be a good option for you. In either event, consult with a good attorney.\n\nBest of luck to you.\n\nAttorney Rebekah Ryan Main\n\n\nIf you found this answer helpful, let me know by clicking the \"Mark as Helpful\" button at the bottom of this answer or select it as Best Answer.

        "Consider filing a Request for Orders asking for support to be modified due to a change in circumstances. (Be prepared to weather the storm, including accusations that you are shirking and/or that you got demoted for your own fault and she shouldn't have to suffer for it.)"

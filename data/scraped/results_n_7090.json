        "Mr. Regar has provided an excellent answer on what lawyers refer to as \"vicarious liability\" laws in CA.\n\nThe other question here, as I see it, is whether you may be liable for the debts of your wife under CA's \"community property\" laws. I don't do family law, California is a community property state, and as I understand it, in community property states, most property you acquire during marriage is owned by your \"community,\" which is controlled by you and your spouse. Your community property is liable for debts accrued by you or your spouse during the marriage. This is true regardless of whether you or your spouse are personally responsible for the debts. The key here is the phrase \"during the marriage.\" For example, if you incur a debt, such as a student loan, while you're single, and then get married, it won't automatically become a joint debt. After a legal separation or divorce, a debt is generally owed only by the spouse who incurred the debt. So, the \"$64 Question\" is whether the actions of your wife results in a debt that was \"incurred during the marriage\" and whether your separation was a \"legal separation\" that would cut off those debts. I would address that question to your divorce/family lawyer. I may not have eased your fears here, but I hope that this was helpful.",

        "If your name is not on the title of the car involved in the accident, you wouldn't be liable if you were sued by the injured driver. If your name is on the title of the car, you could be sued under the permissive use statute. Your liability would be limited to $15,000 per person or $30,000 per accident, and $5,000 property damage. If your wife has insurance on the car and the insurance paid at least the minimum 15K/30K/5K, you would not be liable under the permissive use statute. If you and your wife are legally separated the community property would not be liable for the tort of your spouse.\n\nVehicle Code section 17150 provides: \"Every owner of a motor vehicle is liable and responsible for death or injury to person or property resulting from a negligent or wrongful act or omission in the operation of the motor vehicle, in the business of the owner or otherwise, by any erson using or operating the same with the permission, express or implied, of the owner.\"\n\nVehicle Code section 17151(a) provides, in part: \"The liability of an owner . . . is limited to the amount of fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000) for the death of or injury to one person . . . and . . . to the amount of thirty thousand dollars ($30,000) for the death of or injury to more than one person . . . and is limited to the amount of five thousand dollars ($5,000) for damage to property.\"\n\nThe statutory limitation under section 17151(a) \"does not apply . . . to a vehicle owner's own common law negligence, as distinguished from the owner's statutory vicarious liability for the operator's negligence.\" (Fremont Compensation Insurance Co. v.

Negligent entrustment is a common aw liability doctrine. Conversely, the obligation of a lending owner of an automobile is one of statutory liability.

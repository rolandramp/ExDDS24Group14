    "question": "We left the USA last year and moved to Europe. We have no plans to return. I've been paying off a variety of credit card debt and some unsecured personal loans ( around $130k total ) since we left via monthly payments but work has somewhat dried up for us now and i don't envisage being able to continue to make the payments come March. What do you think my options are bankruptcy wise?",

        "Are all of your creditors in the US? What do you think will happen to you if you stop paying them and remain outside the US? Likely, nothing. What would happen if you stopped paying your creditors and returned to the US? Likely, you would face a spate of lawsuits for the debts owed. Once back in the US, you would be a BK prospect.",
        "You would need to be living in the US in order to be eligible to file bankruptcy here. You can look into filing bankruptcy in your country, but if you ever moved back to US, creditors would still have a right to collect, depending on Statute of Limitations.",
        "Wise to file bankruptcy? There is no way to tell from what you wrote, nor can we tell if you are even eligible to file. You need a consultation with a very experienced bankruptcy expert to find out. Most BK lawyers offer a free consultation, but you might not find any who are willing because you don't live in the USA. So you best be prepared to pay a lawyer in advance for the consultation and analysis."

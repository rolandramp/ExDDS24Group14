    "title": "My wages are being garnished by Dodeka LLC. What can I do?",
    "question": "I received a notice from HR this morning saying my wages are being garnished by Dodeka LLC. They are a debt collector, to my understanding, but this is the first I’ve heard of them or from them. They actually have my grandmother’s address listed for me. I lived there for about a year when I was 17. This was 15 years ago. Im assuming because they don’t have my current address, this is why they never contacted me via mail (or phone for that matter). What can I do? They claim I owe over $4500 and I have no idea what this is for. I did have some credit cards I stopped payment on years ago when I came across some hard times. I settled some of that debt, but not all of it, apparently. Any advice would be much appreciated.",

        "Like you the judgment you are writing about, if it exists, is a mystery to us.\n\nYou will have to track down where this is from, who got served etc.\n\nIt seems they may have served a complaint and obtained a judgment without actually obtaining jurisdiction over you personally.\n\nYou are talking about some debts that are old and not living with your grandmother because the last of that was 15 years ago. Its possible they served her or some resident there, and you have no idea. Or its possible you were served some years back and nothing came of it so you forgot. Or its possible this is a debt you settled.\n\nI suggest you hire a lawyer to track most of this down, particularly if you settled this debt.\n\nHowever without more information its impossible to say what your remedies are other than to assert all of your personal exemptions against the wage garnishment. That would be my first line of defense without actually submitting to jurisdiction. And you can do that with a good lawyer helping you.",
        "Your first stop should be the courthouse where the judgment was entered. The garnishment papers have a court case number. They also have information about the Sheriff (or other agent) who is doing the garnishment. At the courthouse, ask to see the court's file. Then copy the interesting parts of the file. Next, get copies of your credit report -- for free -- from annualcreditreport.com. At the site, avoid the links that try to sell you monitoring or ID theft protection services and click on the smallest link on the page. Take you papers and see a lawyer. Pay for a one hour consultation and document review. There are two things that you can do. 1. File a Claim of Exemption with the Sheriff, if you qualify. 2. File a motion to vacate the default judgment. Do not delay; start today.",
        "This is a default judgment somewhere, perhaps in another state, in which the debt collector evidently is taking advantage of your employer having an office in another state, as I do not believe that Dodeka files cases in California or the number is incredibly low. You will need to get a debt collection DEFENSE attorney in the state where the lawsuit and default judgment were entered. See link below to the National Association of Consumer Advocates, which has such lawyers all over the USA. Be aware that time is critical in getting the judgment set aside by experienced counsel and possible violations of your rights under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, which has one year statute of limitations. That sort of case can be filed by a consumer attorney in California.\n\nBy: Robert Stempler (Please see DISCLAIMER, below)\nCONSUMER LAW OFFICE OF ROBERT STEMPLER\nA Professional Law Corporation",
        "Although it is possible to have a court judgment \"set aside,\" this can be an expensive & time consuming process. I would suggest taking a look at the court records first before making an appointment to meet with a local consumer debt litigation attorney. Hope this perspective helps!",
        "You will have to contact a consumer or bankruptcy attorney in your county. See if you can file a motion to vacate the judgment based upon the fact that you did not receive notice of the summons and complaint. This won't make it go away, it will just stop it for now. Then see about either fighting the lawsuit, settling it or filing for bankruptcy protection."

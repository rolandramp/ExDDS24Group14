    "question": "I have attended my 341 hearing in which I stated to keep my car through redemption, however the current lender is far away from what I am willing to pay. Is it too late to surrender the car? If not when do I surrender? After discharge? I intend on attempting to \"replace\" my car through a redemption finance company.",

        "The lender doesn't get to decide what the redemption price will be -- a judge does. The standard, according to Code section 506(a)(2), is \"the price a retail merchant would charge for property of that kind considering the age and condition of the property\" at the time of the redemption hearing. If you've got admissible evidence to back up your valuation, file a redemption motion and present it to the judge. If you lose, you can then amend your Statement of Intention to surrender the car.",

        "It is not too late to surrender. However, you are obligated under the bankruptcy code to make a good faith effort to transfer the car. That means you need to contact the lender and tell it you are surrendering and then make arrangements.",
        "You can do whatever is best for you. The statement of intention is not binding, nor is your testimony. You are allowed to change your mind. Surrender when you feel like it, if you wait too long, the lender will come and get it, so it is usually a good idea to coordinate the surrender with the lender. You do not want to have your car repossessed while you are paying inside for the gas fill-up you just paid a fortune for!"

        "Under Title 28 of the United States Code, section 2415(a), the applicable statute of limitations for enforcement by the United States government of a claim arising from a breach of a written contract is six years. Because you entered into a loan with a private lender under the terms of the SBA program, when the breach occurred, the lender had the right to assign its rights to the SBA under the terms of the loan guarantee. While under California Code of Civil Procedure ยง 337, the applicable statute of limitation for a claim arising from a loan default is four years, in the case of United States v. Thornburg (9th Cir. 1996), The court held that \"an assignee of the federal government may file an action within six years of the accrual date of a loan pursuant to Section 2415(a).\" If the SBA brought the lawsuit within the six-year period, it is entitled to enforce any judgment obtained by wage garnishment. Nevertheless, such claims are dischargeable in bankruptcy.",
        "It sounds like you personally guaranteed the loan, As long as the lawsuit that resulted in the judgment that lead to the garnishment was commenced within 4 years of the date of the breach, the creditor can garnish your wages. There would have been a writ of execution issued by the court prior to the earnings withholding order. You should check online for the case documents. You will also need to file a claim of exemption if you are able to in order to avoid the garnishment.",
        "The SOL on SBA loans is 6 years.\n\nAlso, SBA loans are not collected via court process. SBA loan garnishments are handled administratively through the Department of Treasury.\n\nAlso, most SBA loan contracts now have a provision that essentially says that the loan guarantor (the SBA) can determine when default occurs. So, although it is common for debts to default upon non-payment, that is not always the case. For SBA loans, default generally occurs once the loan guarantor (the SBA) accelerates the note.\n\nGiven all that, and based on the circumstances you described, it is more likely collection is taking place within the SOL, not outside of it."

    "question": "Civil suit regarding money owed on Visa bank card, which is currently part of a debt relief program I am registered with. Have never been home when they have tried to serve, so now they may go thru Post Office to serve, or it has been suggested that I call them directly & accept. Debt relief company has a legal affiliation that will help once I can send them copy of the summons.",

        "\"Debt programs\" often turn out to be an ugly mess and a waste of money. Your credit can wind up worse than if you filed bankruptcy, and you can be out a ton of money.\n\nQUESTION: How come all the money you already paid for debt settlement has not protected you from getting sued? ANSWER: Maybe it's because the debt program doesn't really do what they promised you.\n\nIf all the promises made by the debt program came true, you wouldn't have been sued, would you? I'm guessing this wasn't supposed to happen?\n\nWhen will the next lawsuit hit you? and then another?\n\nDo yourself a favor before you get taken any worse than you might already have been. Go see a few Bankruptcy lawyers and find out what that can do for you?",
        "Service of process cannot be carried out at a Post Office. The creditor will have to find you at home or at your place of business; they can also deliver the documents to any adult at either place. I personally do not think it makes sense to communicate with the plaintiff if you have not yet been served. Cases do get dismissed if the summons cannot be served on the defendant within a reasonable period of time.\n\nIf you were sued in Alameda County, you can get copies of the Summons and Complaint online through DomainWeb. Contact the court clerk if you do not know the case number or how to get the documents online. Once you have the complaint, contact a debt collection defense attorney and decide if you'd like to go forward by filing an answer. (A defendant can file an answer prior to being served, which is essentially a \"waiver' of service.) You will have a much better result in the case if you are represented by an attorney, or at minimum, have an attorney give you advice and guidance about how to navigate the case and the settlement. If the creditor is a debt buyer, make sure to talk to an attorney who has litigated debt buyer cases."

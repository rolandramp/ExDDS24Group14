    "title": "I am currently in Chapter 13 and included my back taxes in the bankruptcy. Will the IRS keep my refund?",
    "question": "And if the IRS would keep my refund, is there a way I could fight it?",
    "answers": [
        "If you filed a case after 12-31- 2014, then the IRS can apply any refund as on offset against prior years owed; if not, they cannot keep it. ANother issue is who DOES get the refund..the answer is simple anywhere in the US...your ch 13 plan governs and the court order approving it. What does your plan and order provide. In our location many times my clients keep all, or a portion of the refund. The types of refund may also govern the trustee's attempt to argue keeping it..if not from having too few allowances, instead of from having dependants, and you needing the refund to live on, that is a reason to include in the plan keeping it. YOU have control in many cases on obtaining a refund though too..you can increase or decrease allowances! Good luck.",
        "It would be a violation of the bankruptcy stay for the IRS to keep your refund in the absence of a court order. But read your plan - the trustee is probably going to get that refund and use it to pay your debts through your plan. Hope this perspective helps!",
        "Your refund will go to the Ch 13 Trustee who will put it into your plan. As several other have noted, you should talk to your attorney. If you do not have an attorney, you need to get one. Self-represented Chapter 13s have a 99+% failure rate.",
        "I agree with the previous answers that you will need to review your plan and discuss this issue with your attorney of record. I wish to add that the bankruptcy automatic stay does not stop the IRS from intercepting your tax refund if you owe back taxes (Bankruptcy Code 362(b)(1)(F).",
        "Ask your present attorney. Review your plan and any Pre Confirmation Modifications you may have executed. If your refund was not pledged, and you filed your case in 2013 or before, then there is little chance of an tax refund intercept. If you pledged your refund, then you will have to pay it into the plan, once received. However, if you filed your case in 2014, and owed taxes, and are entitled to a refund, more than likely, they will intercept the refund because you owed the taxes in the same year you filed your chapter 13.",
        "I'm not sure what the policy is in Southern District, but in Central District where I practice, all tax refunds rec'd during the life of Chapter 13 case are required to be paid over to the Chapter 13 Trustee who will distribute the proceeds amongst your creditors who file claims. This is something for you to ask your own atty. If you don't have one, the chances of you successfully completing a Chapter 13 are virtually zero.",
        "If you are in a confirmed Chapter 13 Plan that includes payment of the back taxes, the IRS will probably issue the refund, but the Chapter 13 Trustee is entitled to any tax refund (the order confirming your plan more than likely even states that), which will be used toward plan payments, so either way you won't be receiving any refund.",
        "If it is part of your Ch 13 plan, then yes, they will keep your refund. Follow up with the attorney who filed your Ch 13.",
        "If you are currently in Chapter 13, why don't you ask the attorney who is already representing you? If you are not represented by counsel and are in Chapter 13, I would strongly recommend that you find an attorney to represent you."

    "question": "Can they be deported for filing bankruptcy? Will they be asked for their legal status throughout any of the bankruptcy process? Will the court ask about their legal status?",

        "The answer is yes, but. Yes, your uncle can file. Never use a false social security number. Use a valid one or an ITIN.\n\nI agree that the ICE might find him if they were looking for him. But the bankruptcy itself is not a deportable act.",
        "Your aunt and uncle should absolutely not file for bankruptcy until they are here legally. This is a very serious matter and it really could put them in more trouble than they are already in now. From what I have seen at the Creditors Meetings, the U.S. Trustees Office in Santa Ana, CA takes an illegal immigrant filing very seriously and questions the illegal immigrant about how he or she obtained their debt. Oftentimes, there is some element of fraud in the credit applications - whether it is a false social security number or other information. If you have obtained a loan or credit by fraud it is non-dischargable. I do not know what has happened to these poor people but I do wonder what attorney would file bankruptcy for an illegal immigrant - especially in Orange County, CA. I think it is entirely possible that people are reported to the INS. Please pass this on to your aunt and uncle.\n\nPlease note that although this answer may provide information concerning potential legal issues, it is not a substitute for legal advice from qualified counsel.

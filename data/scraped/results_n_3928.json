    "title": "Where do I file the Probate Code 13100 Affidavit in Alameda County?",
    "question": "I'm the sole heir to my mother's estate. She left no will, had no real property, and her personal property was less than $100,000. In order to settle her estate, I need to file a Probate Code 13100 Affidavit to transfer mail, bank accounts, open an estate bank account to pay her debts etc. Where do I file this document and can I do this myself or do I need a lawyer?",
    "answers": [
        "You do not actually file this document with anyone. You simply must submit the affidavit to any institution that is holding a portion of your mother's estate assets.\n\nThe affidavit is simply a form that you fill out swearing to specific institutions holding your mother's estate assets that your mother's estate meets the requirements to avoid probate.\n\nHowever, as mentioned by a prior attorney, banking institutions can be difficult to deal with when it comes to these types of matters. Be prepared to have difficulty explaining to at least one banking institution this situation.\n\nDepending on how the different institutions handle your affidavit hiring an attorney may save you a great deal of stress. I would say that at least at first you may be able to simply fill out the document and submit it yourself. If you hit a wall with any of the institutions you may find that hiring a lawyer would be prudent.\n\nGood luck!",
        "You might need an order to approve the distribution of a small estate if any of the institutions or agencies refuse to recognize your affidavit. In my experience banks are woefully ignorant of the law and don't be surprised if they tell you that they need a court order to do what you want done.",
        "You do not file a small estate affidavit - you submit it to the bank or other financial institution, and they generally will give you the money from the accounts. If you want to keep the money separate to track, open an account to pay bills. Otherwise, if you are the sole heir, you can pay them from your account or with cashier's check."

        "Small claims court lacks jurisdiction over claims that arise under the Family Law Act, including the division of marital debts. The other posting was correct in that you can simply file an Order to Show Cause re Omitted Debt, and ask that the Family Court address the issue. At best though, the Court can only divide and assign to one spouse or the other the responsibility for a community debt. If that spouse then fails to pay, the remedy of contempt is not available (no one can be incarcerated for not paying a debt, only for failing to pay support), and you will need to pay the assigned debt, then seek a further order that your ex-husband pay that amount to you. If he does not, you can enforce the judgment by levy or garnishment.\n\nIf the ex-husband is a flake or unlikely to either pay a debt assigned him or t5o be readiy collectible if you have to pay and then go after him, perhaps you need to consideer whether bankruptcy is an option. Not knowing more about your overall situation, I cannot make a recommendation. But you may wish to realistically explore your options. Remember, the best thing about an ex-husband is the \"ex\". He's no better, he's just not yours.",

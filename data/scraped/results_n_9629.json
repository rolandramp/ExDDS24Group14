    "question": "My ex-boyfriend put me as a co-signer for a loan last year and signed a letter to me that he promised he would pay off the loan and not file bankruptcy. Now he told me that he can't pay off his loan and file a bankruptcy without my agreement. How can I sue him for filing a bankruptcy without my approval? I need a lawyer to help me with this matter..",

        "Your boyfriend doesn't need your approval to file for bankruptcy, but you might be able to sue him for fraud in the bankruptcy court. An adversary proceeding in bankruptcy court is not inexpensive. However, if you want to hire a lawyer, you may have a claim for nondischargeability against your boyfriend. I have handled these types of cases.\n\nContact me if you wish for a further consultation.\n\nBrian Pedigo\nwww.PedigoLaw.com",

If so, you might want to sell it to pay off the loan, or sell it to get the debt lower.\n\nOther attorneys may have a different answer.\n\nAlso, an attorney will have to see both your paperwork and the bankruptcy paperwork.\n\nAct now.

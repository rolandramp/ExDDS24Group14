        "In general, the schedule of debts and assets are completed to ascertain if an asset is community property or separate property. It is often difficult to pinpoint an exact date when assets are acquired and it is generally acceptable to simply indicate whether an asset was acquired before marriage, during marriage, or after the marriage. Additional documentation may be needed to support your position though. Because you are declaring under penalty of perjury when completing your disclosures, you should seek the advise of counsel to ensure that the schedule of debts and assets are accurately and fully completed with all the necessary supporting documents.",
        "The date is the date the accounts commenced. Not sure what you mean by a course of period. You should discuss this with an attorney who can represent you.",
        "You need the help of an attorney to get all of this done correctly and efficiently. As to accounts, it is the date the account was opened.",
        "The idea for the that date is to figure if the asset is community p. or separate p. If you opened the account during the marriage put that date down - the same as if you bought a house. You do not have to put the date down for each deposit.\nt"

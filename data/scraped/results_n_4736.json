        "As an administrator, you are are not personally liable for your deceased mother's debts. However, all of her estate including the land may be attached by her creditors to satisfy her debt. If the gross value of her estate exceeds $150,000, her estate will have go through probate proceeding , because she died intestate (without a will, presumably without a trust as well).",
        "Although I agree in general with the answers of other legal counsel here, I must point out that there are circumstances in which the estate's administrator can become personally liable for debts of the estate. For example, if payments are made without a probate court order, the administrator may become personally liable for unpaid debts (usually in the amount of the unauthorized payments). Further, if payments are made to general creditors without first paying federal and/or state taxes owing, then the administrator may become personally liable for the amounts that should have been applied to unpaid taxes.\n\nIt is therefore important to obtain legal advice regarding the priority of debts before paying any of the general creditors -- and to make payments from the estate only pursuant to the probate court's orders.",
        "As the other attorneys have stated, the land is part of the estate and subject to creditor's claims. If you want to save the land from being sold, you can pay the creditor's yourself and keep the land. If all the debt exceeds the value of the estate, you are not personally liable for the remaining debt.",
        "I am sorry for your loss.\n\nI would need more information to fully answer your other questions,however. The real property is considered an asset of your mother's estate. Have you filed a Probate Petition? Were you appointed by the court as her administrator? If the value of your mother's estate, that would be subject to a Probate, is greater than $150,000, including the real property and personal property, then a probate is required. Even if your mother's bank account and other personal property has minimal value, if the real property has a value of more than $50,000.00 (and assuming that the property is in California), a Probate would be required. It's the gross value, not the net value, that is controlling. In other words, whether or not their is a mortgage on the property or whether or not your mother owned debts is not taken into consideration when determining the value. Do not include anything in joint tenancy where the survivor will own the asset or other items such as life insurance when determining the value of your mother's estate.\n\nYou are not liable to your mother's creditors.How the creditors are dealt with depends on whether they are secured or unsecured, and of course whether there are available assets to pay them. The Probate process requires certain notification to creditors and time frames in which they can make a claim against the estate.\n\nAre you your mother's only heir? Was she married at the time of her death and/or did she have other children or grandchildren? Whether the property has to be sold depends on many factors, including the number of heirs and whether there is a mortgage or reverse mortgage on the property.\n\nIf you'd like to provide additional information, I would be happy to answer your questions.",
        "First the good news, you are not personally liable for the shortfall in assets to pay your mother's debts. Second, the bad news, if the 5 acres was owned by your mother or by her revocable living trust then its value must be applied against her debts or you may become liable. Worse yet, if the land is not in a trust, you will have to go through several steps (depending upon its value) to get control of the property so that it can be sold. If the land is worth less than $150,000 a special method can allow you to get the land's title transferred without the delays and expense of a full probate. The costs of the process have priority and can be paid from the estate prior to other debts."

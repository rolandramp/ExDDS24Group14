        "The law would entitle you to share equally in assets acquired during marriage, including bank accounts, regardless of whether only your husband's name has been on those accounts, or if he has been the only person managing those accounts.

The law also requires that you and your husband disclose all of your current assets and debts, and you will also have the right to conduct further discovery if you have reason to believe that he has not been complete in his disclosures. You may also have the right to child and spousal support, and to ask for your husband to pay for attorney fees. An important note is that you are only entitled to support starting from the date you file a Request for Order in court. You should consider consulting with a lawyer to help you determine what you may possibly receive for support and in the division of assets so you can have an idea of what to expect after you file.",

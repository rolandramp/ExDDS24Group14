    "title": "Can a tow company put a lien against a car that’s registered in my name but the finance company is the title holder?",
    "question": "Car was towed and impounded for a police violation. After the 30 day hold passed the car was supposed to be released to my finance company as I was doing a voluntary repossession because I couldn’t afford to pay the impound fees. The tow company accepted the release paperwork from the CHP. The tow company refused to give me a itemized list for fees. The finance company tried several times to get an itemized list for fees owed. The tow company refused to cooperate. The finance company told the tow company a check will be cut for the fees owed and the car will be picked up for repossession. The tow company said they only take cash. Now the tow company is trying to do a lien sale for the car. There was also a police report filed against the tow company for items stolen from the car that they have in their possession and they’re the only ones who have access to it.",

        "Attorney Caldwell states is precisely and I agree. But you posted this under ch 7 bankruptcy. Why? I see no relevant question to bankruptcy. However, IF you file a ch 7, you should list in Schedule B and exempt in Schedule C the claim for damages for the personal property stolen from the car while in their possession. You have a claim against them and as this is a Bailor-Bailee relationship, you can sue for the value of the items stolen from the car while in their possession! It is up to a judge and the veracity/credibility of your statement of what was in there when towed, and the value thereof. But you must list that claim if you file bankruptcy.\n\nYOur other debts on car and to towing company will be discharged if you file ch 7 too. Other facts and issues can also affect your case so I will point out some of those next too. You own the car, the finance company simply has a security interest in it.\n\nYou need and want to enjoy your fresh start also. But the most important thing is to meet with an attorney as you asking this question means you have not. You care about 2 goals: keeping everything you have equity in and discharging all your debts. If you don't have any of the exceptions to discharge you will obtain that goal; most exceptions are set forth in 11 USC. 523 (Google it) like child support, some income taxes, traffic (in a ch 7) and criminal fines , and presumption of student loans. But some debts are dischargeable in a ch 13 but NOT in a ch 7 so you want to make sure and your attorney will discuss any such types with you also!\n\nYour exemptions depend on what state you have lived in in the last 2 years and thus if in your state, then your states exemptions will apply. Most persons filing keep everything they own but your attorney will confirm that with you when they learn everything you own and the equity thereof!\n\nSome secured debts like homes, vehicles, other secured debts an attorney will discuss your options on also as you must list any debts; but that does not mean you will lose them unless you have too much equity or are in default on paying for them! Discuss those options if they apply with your attorney too.\n\nBut other issues can arise that can greatly harm your case. Just one example: If you paid back a relative $3,000 11 months ago and now file bankruptcy next week, the trustee can SUE that relative to retrieve that $3,000 (under what is called a preference) for the benefit of the bankruptcy estate. As a result, most attorneys don't charge to meet with them the first meeting so meet with one no matter what.\n\nMany great attorneys can be found right here on AVVO in your state so look, call, and meet one as soon as you can.\n\nYou should also want to know when to file: is there an advantage of waiting versus filing now and who should you pay between now and then! Good luck and enjoy your later fresh start.",
        "The fight is between the finance company and the towing company, so why worry about the problem.\n\nSince the practice area chosen is chapter 7, I assume that will be your next move. You will be able to discharge any debt you owe to the finance company, which includes any money paid to the towing company for towing and storage charges.\n\nBefore making a decision to file for relief under the bankruptcy code, you need to know that per a report issued by the US Courts in 2011, the survey that was performed found that pro se chapter 7 cases were dismissed 8 times as often as chapter 7 cases that were filed with attorney representation.

        "Short answer: yes, they can. Most states have laws that allow towing companies and impound lots and repair shops to put liens on vehicles that have been stored for a certain length of time. How long that time frame is varies by state. The towing company must comply with statutory requirements which usually require that they provide an accounting of how they determined how much they're charging.\n\nBtw, it is very unlikely that the title is in the name of the finance company. The title is probably in their possession but titled in your name until you pay the loan off. When you pay the loan off they'd mark the lien as satisfied and send you the title."

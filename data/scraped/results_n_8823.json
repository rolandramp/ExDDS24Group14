        "You do not need to amend the Statement of Intentions. If you have not signed a reaffirmation agreement and had the court accept it, then the debt is not reaffirmed. Even if it is, you have some time to revoke it. If you decide to surrender, some lenders will negotiate with you. If the vehicle is worth much less than what is owed on it, you may be able to redeem it (refinance for what it is worth through another lender like 722 Redemption Corporation) or replace it (through a similar lender).\n\nIf you do not reaffirm or redeem, then the stay ends. If your state allows repossession at this point, you could lose the vehicle. If not, then you keep it as long as payments are current.\n\nTalk to a local attorney for more information.\n\n[This communication is intended as general information and not specific legal advice, and this communication does not create an attorney-client relationship.]",
        "I join in Mr. Nager's answer and write to emphasize that you can negotiate the terms of a reaffirmation agreement. In some circumstances, I have been able to get reduction of the interest rate from ~29% down to ~10%, with the monthly payments lowered substantially.\n\nAnd I have had a few \"redemption by reaffirmation agreements.\" In those, we agreed that the principal amount owed would be reduced to the current fair market value of the car, repayable at a decent interest rate over the term of the agreement.\n\nSo don't be afraid to negotiate and to be creative in your negotiations. Most creditors really don't want the cars back!",
        "In order to reaffirm you will have to sign the actual reaffirmation agreement. If you do and the court approves it you will have until the later of (a) 60 days after the agreement is filed with the court or (b) the date of your discharge in order to rescind (cancel) the agreement in writing. You may not want to amend your statement of intention so that you can receive and review the agreement before making a decision on whether or not to sign it. The creditor may offer you a better deal. Just understand that if your agreement is approved and you do not cancel it in time you are stuck with this debt after the bankruptcy case to the extent that the car is sold and otherwise. Good luck."

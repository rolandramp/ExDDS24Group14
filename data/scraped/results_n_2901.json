    "title": "Can Bank of America sue me and win on an old credit card Debt that is 12 years old?",
    "question": "I got called today by obviously a credit card collector pertaining a legal matter then referred to call another number to have my questions answered. When I called and they answered as a legal service telling me I was going to be sued in litigations court for the amount of $2500.00 and if I didn't pay with fees it would be $4500.00. Statute of limitions in California is 4 Years so they can't win since I have made no payments since 2002 right?",

        "If you defaulted on payment of a credit card, the creditor has to file a lawsuit within four (4) years of the default; some would say, within four (4) years of the last payment. If a debtor makes an agreement to pay the balance at some later time, it can be argued that the agreement to pay is a \"new contract\" and that the statute of limitations begins to run again. In your situation, if you did not pay anything or agree to pay since 2002, the creditor is unlikely to sue for collection of the debt, since you would have an absolute defense.\n\nThere are many unscrupulous and unethical debt collectors that operate by telephone only, and they often say whatever they think will work to get the debtor to make a payment. If the collector has not sent any correspondence and has not identified his company and/or the location of the company's office, there is little risk in telling lies to get a payment. Your best course of action is to do the following:\n\n1) If you are called again, ask for the debt collectors first and last name and the physical location of the debt collector's office (or P.O. Box number) - write down any names and addresses you are given. .\n2) Send the debt collector a written request for debt validation. Send it by Certified Mail with return receipt requested.\n3) Indicate to future callers that you are awaiting a response to your request for debt validation\n4) Do not admit that you owe a debt; do not agree to make a payment.\n\nGood luck.",
        "They may be a scam collector. If they are from anywhere near Buffalo, New York, they are a scam. If they want you to buy a card and then call them with the numbers on the receipt, they are a scam. If they are threatening you with taking you to court, they are a scam. I bet they do not have a real street address, and their names are fictitious. If they are suing you, they need to have a lawyer who is licensed to practice law in the State of California, and who as a State Bar number. If they do not have a lawyer, and are threatening to sue you, they are a scam. There are scam artists out there who obtain identifying information about debtors and then try to scare them into paying money. How about their sending you a copy of whatever document they have which authorizes them to collect a debt. And, the charge-off billing statement.",

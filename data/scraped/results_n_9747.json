    "title": "Can bad debts affect a green card application?",
    "question": "Hi, I came to the US on a visitor's visa and became an overstayer some 7 years ago. I then met and married my wife who is an American citizen. Over the years I have been here I have had some bad debts which are now with a collection agency. Will this affect my application for a green card / permanent residence? and if so, how can I rectify this? Thanks.",
    "answers": [
        "If the debt was accumilated over time and in the course of normal business, the debt should not affect your green card even if it is referred to a collection agency. I would work out a payment plan with the collection agency and put this issue to rest. However, if the debt is to intentionally defraud somebody and the amount is over $10,000, in this case, it may affect your green card. Good luck\n\nHassan Elkhalil\nwww.greencardusa.com"

    "title": "Do you need to include 401k, IRA(retirement) and expected tax refund under your exemptions on chp13 bankruptcy? pls advise",
    "question": "I'm in CA and in a midst of working with an attorney and filling out paperworks. There is this form about exemptions which ask about assets stuffs and 401k/IRA and tax refunds, etc. Do I really need to include all of these in that form? If so, why? For 401k/IRA, I can just look up statements. But for expected tax refund, I'm not sure if how much refund I will be getting this year since I just started paying my mortgage this year(since Jan). I may not get any refund at all since I am claiming exemptions=9(both fed/state) in my paystubs.The whole of last year, I didn't pay my mortgage due to paycut/etc so I didn't get any tax refund at all.Please advise CA attorney on how to handle this. Thanks in advance..",

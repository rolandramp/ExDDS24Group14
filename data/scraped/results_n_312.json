        "Being judgment proof means that you own no assets which are capable of being garnished, liened levied upon or attached is any other manner prescribed by law.",
        "Unfortunately you are not judgment proof when you have equity in your home/real property. A creditor with a judgment against you is able to record the abstract and create a secured lien against any real property you know, which also earns interest of approximately 10% annually. You may want to consult with an attorney about debt settlement and possibly available bankruptcy options if you need help resolving a debt with a creditor (before lawsuit and before a judgment is entered).",
        "There is no such thing as claiming that your judgment proof, especially since you have assets. To properly answer your questions and address your concerns, the best way to handle this is with an in person consultation with an experienced CA bankruptcy attorney. Use AVVO's Find a Lawyer tool to select a qualified attorney. Good luck. THIS IS NOT LEGAL ADVICE! YOU NEED TO SPEAK TO AN ATTORNEY WHO IS LICENSED IN YOUR STATE FOR LEGAL ADVICE. This is merely suggestions for you to think about in discussing your situation with the local attorney.",
        "You should definitely at least consult with a debt relief or debtor's attorney before you decide what to do. Consultations are free usually.",
        "You are not necessarily judgment proof just because you can’t pay your debts with money. The law allows judgment creditors to collect or secure their judgment against other assets you own besides your income. A bank levy or a judgment lien against your home are two of them. Depending on the amount of equity you have in your home you may have options to protect it. You should speak to a knowledgeable debt relief and/or bankruptcy attorney to go over your case and get your questions answered. If a lawsuit has been filed or a judgment has already been entered time is of the essence to protect yourself and property."

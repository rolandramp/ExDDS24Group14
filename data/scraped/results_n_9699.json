    "title": "Car loan defaulted that was financed under corporation name. Company has sinced been dissolved. Judgment filed? What can I do?",
    "question": "We helped an employee obtain a car loan using our corporation name. My business partner who is also an officer of corp. signed a Personal Guaranty. (I did not sign any paperwork for it). Business went bad, couldn't keep up with payments, and we had to return the car. Car was auctioned and finance company is pusuing the difference. My partner filed personal bankruptcy last year and included that debt in it. We have since closed our doors and dissolved the corp. The corp. was issued a 1098-A Acquisition or Abandonment of Secured Property. Recently, their attorney sent letter saying a judgment has been filed against the corporation for the money owed. My partner's BK attorney said to just write letter back saying company is closed. What can I do? Thank you.",

        "The BK attorney has given you advise. If the corposation is disolved, assuming that the dissolution complied with all of the Sectry of State requirements, then the lender has nothign to go after. Your partner has filed the BK and you signed no documents. Send the letter to teh finance company attorney with proof that the coprpation was disolved and let it go. Good luck.",
        "That might be the answer, but it depends on whether the company was properly dissolved. Depending on the state law involved, you may have been required to properly satisfy all outstanding debt before officially dissolving. If it was done properly, it is unlikely the car company has any recourse.\n\nIf you would like to discuss any issues further, please feel free to contact my office. My contact information is below.

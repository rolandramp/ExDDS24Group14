    "title": "Will an inheritance received by our children become part of my wife's and my Chapter 13 bankruptcy estate?",
    "question": "My wife and I filed Chapter 13 bankruptcy 13 months ago. We are on a 60 month payment plan and are scheduled to pay 25% of our total unsecured debts. My three children are ages 15, 12, and 10. If my children receive an inheritance from my parents, will I need to report their inheritance to my wife's and my bankruptcy trustee? Will their inheritance become part of our bankruptcy estate resulting in a higher bankruptcy monthly payment? My parents are leaving an inheritance to my children rather than to me.",

So, the real answer to your question will lie in your parent's estate plan. Ideally, your parents have (or by operation of the Will, will create) a generation skipping trust. A trust set up such that your kids are the beneficiaries.",

        "Your kids are NOT you. I see no legal reason why you would have to report. However, if you start using that income for paying expenses, it might come back to haunt you as it would free up other income of yours which could trigger a trustee in filing a motion to modify your plan. Thus, I would not use any of that inheritance if you were thinking of it, until the end of your bankruptcy . Finally, I would carefully review the court order approving your plan to make sure there is no language which would require disclosure too. Good luck and I hope my answer assist you. Contact a good experienced chapter 13 bankruptcy attorney if you have questions on this. ..but your kids assets are theirs and yours are yours! ! That is the purpose of good estate planning!"

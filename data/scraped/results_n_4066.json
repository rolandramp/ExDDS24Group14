        "Sounds like a collection scam. This is happening all the time. People buy lists of uncollectible debts then call, harass and threaten the debtors until they pay something (either because they're scared or just want some peace). If they call again, demand written proof of the debt AND their identity. Don't pay them anything, as that could start the Statute of Limitations running again. If they threaten any criminal action, tell them that's extortion and you're reporting them to the police.\n\nRob",
        "If the debt was really paid off (or even if your last date of payment was) 9 years ago, the claim is bogus and a violation of the FDCPA and RFDCPA because a debt collector is prohibited from threatening to take an action they can't really take - like filing a lawsuit on a time-barred debt. The real question is whether the company is a legitimate debt collection company or a scam company. To find out, you'd need to request a physical mailing address. If they give you one, it greatly increases their legitimacy.\n\nIf your claim is successful, you would be entitled to up to $1,000 in statutory damages (or possibly $2k, including the RFDCPA claim), actual damages, plus your reasonable attorneys' fees and costs (making legal representation free).\n\nI hope this helps. If you have any questions or need further information, you can contact me directly at gesundk@gesundlawoffices.com.\n\nBest Regards,\n\nKeren",
        "Sure, I suppose that COULD sue you. It would then be up to you to assert the affirmative defense that the statute of limitations has run. Best bet here is to simply ignore the calls. Debt collectors and others running scams are crafty and you can be sure that anything you say will likely be used against you. Best just to not give them any ammo at all.",
        "It's not your job to furnish them with proof that a debt is past the SOL. If you haven't paid on the thing in 9 years, don't acknowledge the debt, don't try to settle, just tell them to \"Statute of Limitations, leave me alone\".",
        "Who are they? do they have a real business name, a real street address? There are scamsters who get indentifying information about former payday loan clients and then threaten collection. They never sue. You can be sure that it is a scam if they do not have a street address or if they want payment by means of a moneygram or Walmart card.\n\nWill they send you documents showing that they own the account? A copy of the loan agreement? If they do not have it, they will not succeed in court, if they go to court.\n\nIt is a violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act for a debt collector to imply that there is a possibility of criminal prosecution for not paying a debt. It is a civil matter, not a criminal matter, even if the scamster is legitimate."

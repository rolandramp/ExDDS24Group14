    "title": "My ex-boyfriend began spending & opening credit under my name without persmission. Help",
    "question": "I originally added him to some credit cards since we lived together and had been together over 7 years but never authorized to shop away and spend as he pleased. He then began opening up other cards without my knowledge and using them ruining my credit. We broke up over a year ago and he said he would pay all the cards as he listed in email but stopped paying. Now my accounts are all in collections and he will not return my calls or pay what he charged up. Any advice?",

        "Start by making a complaint to law enforcement authorities. Be prepared to cooperate fully in any police investigation and to provide all documents as requested.

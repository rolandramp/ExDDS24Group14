    "title": "Medical bill for deceased spouse gone to collection agency",
    "question": "My son, 30 years old loses spouse 28 years old to cancer. They filed taxes married filing single. She had medical bill with only her name on it that did not get paid. Collection agency now sends the bill with my son's name on it. She had no will or estate. They were both medical residents payed only a stipend. Can he tell collection agency , she passed; send copy of death certificate and say there is no money to pay? Also ask them to not ding his credit? Please advise, thank you",
    "answers": [
        "Where were they doing their residency? The laws of that state will apply.\nIf in California, I think the 1 year from the date of death statute of limitations will apply. e.g. They have to sue within 1 year of when the wife died.\nSon may want to contact a local BK attorney to write the. collection people a letter. Perhaps it would say that further collection efforts are an unfair business practice (B&PC 17200). Or, my client has $2000 to pay you to go away or to pay me for bankruptcy.",
        "Surviving spouse (son) likely responsible based on community property law.\nHowever, begin by corresponding with creditor and requesting they write off bill. Creditor may write off debt and cease collection efforts.",
        "Yes, he can do that. It may work.So sad."

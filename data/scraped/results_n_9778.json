    "question": "My mothers brother & his wife emigrated to the USA 50 years ago (and also became US citizens) unfortunatley my uncle died in December 2003, and now recently (Jan 09) my aunt has passed away. They never had any children. My aunt had sisters and brothers who have all passed away, the same as my mothers brothers and sisters have, although all the brothers & sisters from both families have children (ie. nieces & nephews to my Uncle & Aunt). What is now the legal sequence of inheritance? is my mother as the only remaining first blood relation the main heir, or does it now go to the next generation to be equally divided?",

        "The previous answer begs the question you asked. If California law applies and neither your aunt nor your uncle had a will, then the property passes by intestate succession. If there are no children, then California probate code section 6402.5(a) would apply as to real property (e.g., a house) (since your aunt passed away more than 5 years after your uncle, section 6402.5(b) would NOT apply as to personal property.\n\nYour uncle's share of the real property would be distributed to his nearest surviving relatives (his surviving siblings and the \"issue\" of deceased siblings) and aunt's share of the real property would be distributed to her nearest surviving relatives (her surviving siblings and the \"issue\" of deceased siblings).\n\nThe personal property would all be distributed to your aunt's nearest surviving relatives (again, surviving siblings and \"issue\" of deceased siblings).\n\nIf the estate is worth less than $100,000 and it is in California, you can use a \"small estates affidavit\" to distribute the property (if there is real property involved, though, there are a few special considerations that need to be taken into account). Even if the estate is worth less than $100K, it might be easier to do a probate if there are a number of siblings & issue of deceased siblings to contend with or if there are a number of debts.\n\nThis information is not intended to substitute for professional legal advice and does not create an attorney-client relationship.

The surviving spouse receives one-half of the separate property if the decedent had only one child, or issue of a deceased child. c. The surviving spouse receives one-half of the separate property if the decedent left no issue, but left parent(s) or their issue. d.

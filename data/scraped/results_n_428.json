    "title": "How long does chapter 7 and chapter 13 bankruptcy stay on your credit report ?",
    "question": "I was injured last year in October and all of my Bill's got behind and sent to collections and I now have people banging on my door threatening me about bad credit card debt. I really need a fresh start and looking at all of my options. Looking at the pros and cons between chapter 7 and 13, I'm getting mixed messages on which one stays longer on your credit report, I see some say that chapter 7 stays only 7 years but then i just saw something else say that it stays 10 years. Looking at 13 I'm also getting different time lines. I've seen 7 years, 8 years and 10 years. Which one lasts longer on your credit ? Or does it depend on the situation ?",

        "I agree with my colleagues. Both Chapter 7 and Chapter 13 affect your credit the same way. Which chapter you file is really going to depend on your income and assets you own. You will want to speak with an experienced bankruptcy attorney to determine which chapter is best for you.",
        "The Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), Section 605, is the law that regulates credit reporting agencies. The law states that credit reporting agencies may not report a bankruptcy case on a person’s credit report after ten years from the date the bankruptcy case is filed. The FCRA does not distinguish between Chapters 7 and 13, perhaps becuase tracking cases that start as Chapter 13 but convert to Chapter 7 or vice versa is simply too costly and time-consuming.\n\nThe Bankruptcy Court has no jurisdiction over credit reporting agencies and does not report to any of the agencies. The bankruptcy petition, schedules, and other documents are public records.

        "I completely agree with the prior response, but will add the following: Chapter 7 cases are usually fixed fee cases. Chapter 13 allows for some of the attorneys fees to be taken over time through the monthly plan payments, but this is subject to the specifics of the case (such as the amount of the monthly payment, whether there are sufficient funds available to pay priority debts which need to be repaid 100% through the plan, etc.)\n\nIn short, as was already said, everyone's situation is different and the facts and complexity of the case will dictate the cost. That said, attorneys' fees will of course vary, just like doctors charge different fees. I've said this before and I'll say it again: People don't generally bargain-shop for doctors and they shouldn't do it for attorneys--particularly ones that are helping you with your financial situation. You need it done right. That doesn't mean a less expensive attorney won't handle your case as well as a more expensive one, but your main criteria should be the quality of the attorney and how comfortable you are with them.\n\nMark J. Markus, Attorney at Law\nhttp://www.bklaw.com/",
        "I don't know of any average price, and I don't know how any attorney can quote a price without first discussing your situation with you. The complexity and time required for a Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 bankruptcy varies greatly from situation to situation."

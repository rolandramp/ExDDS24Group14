    "title": "What purpose does the AVVO free question forum serve? Foreclosures, Real Estate, Business, Bankruptcy, Debt, Family law.",
    "question": "I am an avid fan and occasionally read questions and answers for self-education. I have a few observations for attorneys. Almost always, it is recommended that the questioner retain counsel. Understandable caveat but insofar as a question is posed, does this not suggest that (a) there is a lack of money or, (b) one is trying to learn of options before consulting counsel. Secondly, I have on a few occasions noticed that some attorneys could be quite hostile to the questioner. In one instance, an attorney stated that the questioner was trying to get a house free. Really, that gratuitous comment was unwarranted, very rude and insensitive. In a response comment, the questioned indicated he would pose both his question and response on Yelp!. The attorney threatened a defamation suit. Really! Thirdly, I posed a securities question on the forum. One response, and I paraphrase, “no right minded attorney would answer such a question.” In fact, several did – one being particularly thorough. Based on the responses, counsel was retained. While there is no free lunch, the forum exists. You do not have to respond but if you do, be gracious. This is surely appreciated by the questioners. Thanks.",

        "If someone has a general legal question regarding an area of law, posting it in the AVVO forum is a decent idea.

        "The forum is meant to be a place to discuss things, but not to offer legal advice. Some lawyers read the question and see nothing but a can of worms they don't want to open.

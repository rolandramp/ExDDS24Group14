    "title": "How do I go about receiving the title to my car after I paid it off through chapter 13 bankruptcy...three years ago.",
    "question": "I completed chapter 13 bankruptcy in 2016 without any missed payments or issues. I wanted to make sure my car got paid off so I continued making payments during bankruptcy and when the bankruptcy was discharged the car was finally paid off. I had recently moved out of the area around the time my bankruptcy was about finished and I didn't receive my title in the mail once the car was paid off. I wasn't sure if the title would have automatically been mailed to me once the car was paid off and wondered if it could have been mailed to my previous address, then maybe wasn't forwarded to my new address. If that was the case, then where would it have gone? Who should I call to find out? Would I have had to pay a title fee before receiving it? I want to sell that vehicle now but don't know how I can without having the title or what to do about it?",

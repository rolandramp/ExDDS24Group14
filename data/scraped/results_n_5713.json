    "title": "I have a $500,000 NOL carryover from real estate 10 years ago, If I file bankruptcy, Chapter 7 will this eliminate the NOL",
    "question": "carryforward benefit?",
    "answers": [
        "Filing a chapter 7 bankruptcy would not simply eliminate the NOL; however, during the time your bankruptcy estate is open the bankruptcy trustee would be allowed to use the NOL on the estate's tax returns, if any are required, and the NOL itself would have to be reduced by the amount of any discharged debt that would have given rise to discharge of indebtedness income had you not been in bankruptcy. So, for example, if you had a personal debt, not secured by anything, of $100,000 that was discharged in your bankruptcy, the NOL would have to be reduced by that amount because outside of bankruptcy you would have had income from the discharge of indebtedness.",
        "This is probably more of a tax question than a bankruptcy question, but speaking from a bankruptcy point of view, I would think your NOL carryforward benefit is in the nature of a tax credit that you can choose to take whenever you want, or not use at all. I do not believe it would fit the definition of \"property\" of the bankruptcy estate under Bankruptcy Code Section 541, so, if it is not considered property of the estate, then the filing of a Chapter 7 would have no effect on it and it would not need to be scheduled or exempted.",
        "This is more of a tax question, I would think. I have never seen or heard of a case in a Chapter 7 where the trustee has used this or even tried to...but that doesn't mean that it can't happen, I guess. I would talk to a tax person and a bankruptcy attorney."

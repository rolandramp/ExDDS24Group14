        "Yes. Simply transferring assets to a living trust does not divest actual ownership for all purposes. The living trust is a pass through to avoid probate.",
        "If you are placing the rental home in your revocable living trust, the answer is yes...you still own the rental home for tax (and reporting) purposes.",
        "Yes. You will still own the house for purpose of FAFSA eligibility means test.",
        "Yes. Living trusts are generally revocable. Putting property, real or personal, does not mean that for tax purposes you no longer own the property as you are freely able to transfer property in and out of the trust. Revocable living trusts are useful for passing on property outside of probate, not for avoiding taxes.",
        "Putting property into a trust does three things: (1) lets someone handle finances for you if you're incapacitated; (2) avoids probate; (3) avoids Medí-Cal recovery in California if you ever need Medi-Cal to help pay for a nursing home. It does not protect or hide assets or make them non-countable for any purpose.",
        "Yes as long as it is a revocable trust. You will have to feed the house in the name of your trust. This will avoid probate when you pass."

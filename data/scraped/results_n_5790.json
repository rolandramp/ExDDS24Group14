    "title": "Is an IRA in Calif protected from a judgement creditor outside of bankruptcy?",
    "question": "If you have a credit card judgement against you, outside of bankruptcy, will your IRA still be protected from creditors? I'm getting conflicting information. From what I'm reading, an IRA is protected, depending on the court reviewing what you need to support yourself or family. I'm unemployed, 59, my mother's caregiver, I will not be going back to work. Would her income be counted? Does federal law over ride state law, or does federal law only apply to bankruptcy. I've also read it depends on where the funds came from. Mine was an employer 401k roll over. I've read a recent ruling, makes those funds exempt from judgement.",

        "OIn a BK filed in Calidornia, it is California law that determines the exemptions, under the California Code of Civil Procedure, either the \"703\" series of exemptions or the \"704\" series, depending on the facts of your case. Such as CCP Sect 703... or 704... Those exemptions apply to to all judgment collection matters, whether there is a bankruptcy or not. So your IRA acvount will most likely be protected and exempt under the CA CCP (see for example, CCP Sect. 703.140(b)(10).",
        "The credit card will not be able to attach your IRA while it is with the Financial Institution. Once you start dipping into that money and it gets to your regular checking account then it is fair game. If you owe Federal Income Tax, the IRS can attach your IRA.",
        "IRAs are subject to creditor protection rules both under Federal bankruptcy law and California state law. For example, the Federal 2005 Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 provides a $1,000,000 exclusion for IRAs. By California law standards, IRAs are only protected to the extent that the debtor actually needs the funds for retirement. In other words, whether or not the funds are protected under California law depends upon what the judge believes. However Federal Law you should be okay, but it is always best to have a Bankruptcy attorney actually look at your situation to make sure.",
        "An IRA is protected by federal law. California law has nothing to do with the protection afforded to retirement accounts. You are not required to use Bankruptcy exemptions to protect your IRA. Hope this perspective helps!"

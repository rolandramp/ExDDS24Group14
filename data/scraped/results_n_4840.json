    "title": "Going through divorce and trading in the car to reduce the loan",
    "question": "Two month ago my husband and I bought a car. The loan was $40,000, the current value of the car is $28,000. Only $2000 were put down, and there were two car payments of $640 each. Unfortunately, now we are divorcing, and the car is considered community property. The negative value on it is around $11000, so we cannot just sell it, as we cannot pay up the negative value upfront. Do you think we can trade the car in and buy two cheaper used cars without any down payment, and thus split the negative value? Is it possible? And what if my husband does not agree to that? Can the judge order him to go along with my plan, as none of us separately can afford this car?",
    "answers": [
        "While a judge may approve of this plan if you were to both agree to it, I do not believe that any judge has the authority to make \"creative\" orders like this one. They are authorized to order division of assets and debts, including ordering the sale of assets in order to divide them, but have no authority to order a party to incur a new debt.",
        "Regardless of the business aspect and feasibility of your plan to trade in the car; if you can convenience a judge that your plan will put lesser burden on the community, preserve assets and solve the transportation problem, I believe a judge will approve your plan if it makes sense.",
        "No car dealer would do what you are asking. it does not makes sense from a business side. Have a face to face consultation with an experienced family law attorney to find out your options."

    "title": "Any code to block a bankruptcy case to be re-opened after it has been closed for more than 1 year?",
    "question": "The person who owe me money did not and was unwilling to include my debt on her discharging list when she filed for bankruptcy. But after almost 1 1/2 years after the case was closed she changed her mind and try to re-open her case to include my debt. Can she do that? In the meanwhile, to assure that she can get relief she served me as a defendant (using different case#). Can she assume that I will block her petition and sue me for her assumption? The complaint is all about getting the debt discharged. As there is no 'fact' that I took any action, can I refuse to become a defendant?",

        "You did not mention whether this was a Chapter 13 or Chapter 7. Was it an asset case? If it was not an asset case, and it was a Chapter 7, then some jurisdictions consider your debt discharged based on this scenario. Not listing the debt could be considered fraud rendering it non-dischargeable. A bankruptcy court will decide the issue once and for all. If you wish to dispute it, do so NOW.",
        "Yes, she is trying to get your debt discharged, and no, you can't refuse to become a defendant. What your course of action should be depends on how much money you are owed. If it's a significant amount, you should immediately contact a local bankruptcy attorney, who may be able to challenge the request to discharge your debt. If the debt is small, you can not take any action, but in that case the debt will most likely be discharged, so you will never be able to collect it.\n\nThe above is provided for informational purposes only. It is not intended as legal advice, and does not create an attorney-client relationship."

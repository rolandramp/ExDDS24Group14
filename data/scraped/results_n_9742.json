    "title": "When adding members to an LLC, do they then inherit the LLC's existing debt equally?",
    "question": "Our LLC has debt, and we have members who wish to join. Are they then equally responsible for the existing debt, even though they weren't there when it accumulated?",
    "answers": [
        "Generally speaking, only the LLC should be responsible for its debt. If the LLC borrows money, the LLC is obligated to pay the money back. The assets of the LLC would be at risk for liabilities, but the members should not be personally liable. Therefore, if new members are added to the LLC, they should not have any personal liability.\n\nIf current members of the LLC of guaranteed debt so that they are in fact personally at risk, the new members should have not risk personally, unless they agree to assume it.\n\nThe concept of the LLC is to insulate members personally from the company's debt. An illustration from a publicly held company might be helpful. If you buy stock in General Motors, it is not significantly differnent from becoming a member of an LLC. You have no liability for GM's debts, but the money you paid for the stock is at risk if GM does not pay its debts. The LLC functions in a generally similar manner.\n\nBest regards,\n\nKen Sprang\n\nKENNETH A.

        "From a liabilitiy perspective the new members would not be personally responsible for the LLC's debt unless they sign a Guaranty with the creditor to pay it. They would not personally inherit it. And it would not be equal unless all of you were to be equal partners.\n\nFrom a tax perspective the new members would have an inside/outside basis problem (assuming the LLC is being taxed as a partnership). That is, they will have paid say $20,000 for their membership interest but their capital accounts would be immediately reduced by their pro rata share of the LLC's debt. This would reduce the value of their capital account from $20,000 to a much lower amount. So, immediately the value of their investment would be diminished. This would also cause disadvantageous tax results when they try to sell their LLC interests and when they get distributions of profit if any year end.\n\nOne solution is to do a special allocation to the existing members. Another is to reduce their buyin amount to reflect value of membership interest less pro rata share of LLC debt.\n\nThey should consult with a tax lawyer who handles partnership issues.\n\nI am offering this information for educational purposes only.

    "title": "Chpt. 13 was dismissed for non-payment. My only secured creditor is for my car. I want to pay off the balance.",
    "question": "In pro-per, I filed my Chpt. 13 on 9/4/13, my plan confirmed on 8/2/14, the only creditor recieving payment under my plan was the secured creditor for my vechicle. After a valuation hearing, the court set the value of my vechicle at $2.800.00. According to the trustee, after the dismissal the balance owed to this secured creditor is $1902.00. Can I use my tax return to pay this creditor the balance and keep my vechicle. Or do I need to file a Chpt 7 and negotiate with the creditor after filing? Would the creditor be entitled to file a claim under a new Chpt 7 filing for an amount in excess of the previous valuation of $2800. or in excess of the $1900. owed based on my previous plan payments? Also, if I file a Chpt 7, will I be able to keep my tax return?",

        "If you file a Chapter 7, it is most likely that the creditor won't file a claim at all for the simple reason that you are probably a \"no asset\" case. In such a case, most secured creditors will just repo the car whenever they are legally able to (unless the car is of just too little value to mess with it).\n\nThe caveat is that you can bring a special \"redemption\" motion before the court in a Chapter 7 and ask once again that the car be valued (I assume it has further dropped in value). The court will order you to pay the value of the car now, not what it was during the Chapter 13 time. If you can pony up the value of the car in one payment, you pay that amount and then they have to release the pink slip to you.\n\nYou would never do this of course if you happened to owe less on the car than what it is currently worth. In computing what you owe on the car, the creditor will give you credit for the amount received in the Chapter 13, but the former valuation of the car has nothing to do with the present. They will just apply the amounts received to the claim.\n\nWhile I don't know your particulars, in most low income, low asset, no real property bankruptcy cases in California, the Debtor's possessions will be 100% exempt under the \"wildcard\" exemptions of California Civil Code 703.140. In such a case, a debtor is permitted to keep their tax refund. In claiming and analyzing exemptions, you should consult an attorney.",
        "Yes, you can keep your tax return, it is the refund that may or may not be exempt. In a Chapt 7 case, so long as the refund is listed and claimed as exempt, you can use those funds to address the vehicle.",
        "I will echo Mr. Caldwell, any cramdown provided by the Chapter 13 vanished when the Chapter 13 was dismissed. Unless the car creditor screws up, they will be seeking the pre-Chapter 13 car loan balance, less any payments, plus additional late fees and interest.\n\nFiling Chapter 7 solely for the purpose of trying to convince the car creditor to accept less than what is owed is a waste of time.\n\nIf you have other unsecured debts you should contact a Chapter 7 lawyer to analyze your situation for you.",
        "Since your case was dismissed in many ways it is ass if it never existed. The way that is most relevant to your situation is how much you owe on the car. The valuation set for purposes of your ch13 is completely irrelevant and you now owe whatever the original amount owed under the prior financing contract plus interest. You should get credit for any payments made through your plan, however. For example, say when you filed your case you owed $10k @10% interest on a car worth $2800 and through your plan you pay $1900 and your creditor gets 5% interest on the amount ot be paid through your plan. When your case dismisses you go back to owing $10k, you do get credit for the $1900 you paid, but the creditor can charge interest and late fees on all the payments that were due under the contract, so you will likely owe at least the $10k you owed originally. You only get the benefit of the cram down to fair market value if you complete the plan as proposed and confirmed. When your case gets dismissed, the ddebts get reset back to the way they were prior to filing but they do have to give you credit for the amount paid through the plan, but they also get to revert to the original contract terms.\n\nYou can try filing a Ch7 but do not expect them to negotiate with you on the amount owed for the car. Whether you can keep your refund (you can always keep your return, its just paper you file with the IRS) depends on whether you have sufficient exemptions to allow you to protect it.\n\nIf you want to both protect your car and protect your refund, hire a lawyer who knows what they are doing.",
        "1. You can use your tax return to pay off the car.\n\n2. You do not need to file a Ch. 7 and negotiate it.\n\n3. The creditor would file a secured claim for $1900.00 in a Ch. 7.\n\n4.

    "question": "I own a condo worth $450,000 with a remaining loan balance of $150,000. I have outstanding credit card debt of $50,000. I have not been able to get a job since I have virtually no skills.",

        "As of January 1, 2021, homeowners in California can generally exempt up to $600k of equity in their principal residence. Check out attorneys reviews near you and discuss your fact pattern in great detail. The set of rules that allows you to protect/exempt the home, provides little protection for most other assets, i.e, the paid for RR, Cache of original art, money owed to you, etc. might not be protected ... But of course, that is a gross over simplification. Good Luck!",
        "You could file chapter 7 to discharge the c/card debt. As of Jan. 1, 2021, the homestead exemption in San Diego, CA has gone up to a max. of $600,000, so you would not lose your home. However, you would still need to make payments on the loan on your home, or that creditor will eventually foreclose.",
        "The home can be protected under CCP 704.730. An asset analysis will determine if other properties you may own such as any vehicles, savings, claims against parties, etc are also protected. CA has two sets of exemptions, notably one set has the homestead, the other a wilcard. You'll want to know to what extent your assets are protected before you file for bankruptcy protection.",
        "The short answer to your question is - no, your home cannot be sold by a creditor or a bankruptcy trustee if you file for bankruptcy in San Diego County (and you've owned the home for at least 1,215 days). Moreover, a new lien cannot attach to your property (assuming that's what you mean by executing a lien) after filing.\nUpon completion of your BK, your mortgage creditor (who will still have its lien on your property) can foreclose/sell it if you fail to keep up the payments. At that point, you can always file a Ch13 to attempt to save the home; but you'll need regular income to accomplish that.",

Make a list of 4-5 having many 5 star reviews from satisfied clients. If you don't get a prompt call back from one, go on to the next on your list.

        "Your home is probably exempt. You appear to be a good candidate for a chapter 7 bankruptcy. See a bankruptcy attorney in your area. Most offer free initial consults.",
        "It is unclear exactly what you are asking, but I think you are concerned about whether you can protect the equity in your condo, should you decide or be forced to file a bankruptcy, either Ch. 7 or Ch. 13. If I'm correct, the answer is yes, the $300k equity is protected by the new CA homestead law. Certain liens, such as tax liens can override the exemption, but basically, any equity up to a maximum of $600k, depending on the county (San Diego is at $600k) is now protected. This changes as of 1/1/2021. There are other considerations when choosing to file BK, certainly, but that base question is an important one. You should definitely seek out an experienced San Diego bankruptcy attorney to go over all the pros and cons. JCC, San Diego, CA",
        "Well you have, perhaps unknowingly, asked many questions in your one question.\nThe first thing we have to know is what type of lien to which you refer. Is this a judicial lien?\n\nJudicial liens can be removed under certain circumstances depending on the amount of equity in your property and exemptions to which you are entitled under applicable state law.\n\nIf you purchased your property more than 3 1/2 years ago, and there are not any other issues (such as equity being reduced by otherwise avoidable transfers--for example, using non-exempt cash in bank accounts to pay down your mortgage), then you would be entitled in California to the new homestead exemption of between $300,000 and $600,000, depending on the median sales prices in the county where your case is filed.\n\nThus, given the values you provided, you probably would not lose your property in a Chapter 7 case (i.e. a Trustee probably would not sell the property).\n\nIn a Chapter 13 one never loses property, but you have to pay out at least as much as creditors would receive in a Chapter 7 (which, in your case as referenced above, would likely be zero).\n\nThe Devil is in the details in all this, so you need to have a consultation with an experienced bankruptcy attorney in your state to determine the best way forward for you and the benefits and costs of doing so."

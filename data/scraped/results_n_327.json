        "The Report of No Distribution is issued by the Chapter 7 Trustee a day or two after the Meeting of Creditors. You may still have time to file an Adversary Proceeding for a determination that your judgment is nondischargeable if it meets within the Bankruptcy Code definition of Fraud. Look for the Deadline on the Notice of Bankruptcy Case Filing, Meeting of Creditors and Deadlines. It's usually about 60 days after the date initially set for the Meeting of Creditors. This Adversary Proceeding (or \"AP\") is like filing a new lawsuit in Bankruptcy Court connected to the Bankruptcy Case. The AP gets its own case number but is linked to the Bankruptcy case. You must file this AP complaint by or before the deadline or your judgment will be discharged and you will never be able to collect anything. If you were to ever try to collect without filing this AP complaint and getting a determination from the Bankruptcy Court that your state court fraud judgment is nondischargeable, there could be bad consequences for you. Generally it is a good idea to enforce your rights and get this determination of nondischargeability so that you did not waste your time getting the state court fraud judgment.",

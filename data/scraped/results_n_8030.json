    "title": "Do I need a wage garnishment attorney?",
    "question": "I have had my wages garnished from the EDD (Employment Dev. Dept.) for the past few weeks. I owe $3000 from over 5 years ago. I didn't work for 3 years and have just started temping part-time for the past 6 mos. I cannot afford to have my wages garnished. I'm living with my parents and need the salary (probably part-time, if I get a permanet job) to move out on my own and start over. I also have $3000 in credit card debt, $1500 in hospital bills, and over $1000 for the DMV towing and selling my car. The credit card and hospital has gone to an attorney. The car has not.",

        "Quick - go to your local library and get a book title \"Money Troubles - Legal Strategies to Handle Your Debts\" published by Nolo press, it might be able to help you on the wage garnishment. They are only allowed to take so much out of your check and many times they take too much.\n\nWage garnishments can sometimes be fought, but challenge is that usually people can't afford to pay the attorney (and most of us don't work for free because it costs us a lot of money just to keep the doors open and the lights on), so that means you need to educate yourself quickly - go the the library ASAP - also look over the initial papers they gave you when they first said they were going to garnish your wages - they should have told you have to fill out paperwork to protect part of your wages.\n\nGood luck with your situation.\n\nMatthew Williamson",
        "Once a case goes to judgment, garnishment is the main way creditors collect. I know of no creditor that will enter into a voluntary payment arrangement. Why do that if the courts will help you collect? I agree that your debt is so low that I would not advise bankruptcy either. One thing you can do is try to settle the debt on your own. You will need a lump sum to do that.\n\nTalk to a consumer law attorney for help.",
        "Once a creditor has obtained a court judgment against you, preventing a garnishment from going forward becomes a task best handled by the mighty Hercules! Bankruptcy is usually the easiest way to stop a garnishment and to eliminate debts. Due to the relatively small size of your debts, I wouldn't feel right advising you to file bankruptcy, nor can I imagine you being able to fight the giants who are garnishing you on your own.\n\nMy suggestion would be to see if you can arrange to make payments on this debt. It is a long shot, but better to at least give it a try.\n\nHope this perspective helps!"

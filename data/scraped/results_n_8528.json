    "title": "Are 523(a)(2) and 523(a)(3) applicable to a Chapter 7 no assets case which is reopened 1 1/2 years after it had been closed.",
    "question": "523(a) is a bankruptcy law. But it seems that a Chapter 7, no assets case always receives special treatment. Which law exempts a Chapter 7, no assets case be governed by 523(a)? Why an existed bankruptcy law can be defeated? I am confused about the justice system. Can a judge rule a case without quoting appropriate codes or giving reasons? Is it acceptable for a judge to say, \"I can't explain that to you. I am just ruling on the case.\" ?",
    "answers": [
        "Bankruptcy law confuses many people, even attorneys. This is why there have been numerous appeals, including some to the Supreme Court. Section 523 is the Code section that exempts debts from discharge. It applies in all Chapter 7 cases. Take the information to a local bankruptcy attorney. Hopefully, the attorney can assist to either explain the judge's decision or (better yet) give you some assistance to fight the judge's decision.\n\nEither way, more information should help.\n\n[This communication is intended as general information and not specific legal advice, and this communication does not create an attorney-client relationship.]",
        "I can tell by your question that you are confused, frustrated and upset by something a judge did or didn't do in a C7 bankruptcy case. I am a lawyer and felt that way occasionally too. The law is not easy. That is why lawyers have to spend so many years in school, take an exam that takes three days and which about half of the people fail and then spend the rest of their lives reading new and old stuff. And you never get it everything right and that is why it is called \"practicing\" law.\n\nAll sections of the bankruptcy code starting with 1, 3, 5 and 7, like 523(a), apply to C7 cases unless the section specifically says otherwise.\n\nMost of the time a judge must to give the basis for a decision but that depends on the situation and the seriousness of the ruling. You really need to have legal representation. If you can not afford a lawyer then seek assistance from the many organizations in your community that offer or very low cost legal services. You can contact the Bar Association in your area and they have a list of resources.",
        "By definition U.S. Bankruptcy Code sections 523(a)(2) and 523(a)(3) apply to chapter 7 bankruptcy cases. Beyond that the question is confusing in that the bankruptcy concept of exemptions applies to assets and not to exempting a case from a code section.\n\nIt is the litigant's duty to know the law and to argue law and facts to the court, whether represented by an attorney or not. It is not a court's duty to explain law.\n\nI know this is not the answer that you are looking for, but it is the answer.\n\nThis answer is provided for informational purposes only.

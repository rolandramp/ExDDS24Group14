    "title": "Can an opposing attorney file a joint pretrial stipulation without conferring with me?",
    "question": "I am representing myself in a my bankruptcy adversary case because that is all I can afford at the present time. I realize it's an uphill battle. I also expect some abuse by the attorney representing the plaintiff. Here is my current situation: The plaintiff's attorney filed a joint pretrial stipulation without ever consulting with me. They sent me an email asking me to call, which I did. I spoke to the attorney and she stated we could do this through a series of email exchanges until we reached something that both of us could agree on. She was in somewhat of a hurry to get this done because the document was due the next day. That never happened. It begins as follows: \"Subject to the approval of the above names court, all parties submit the following Pretrial Stipulation:...\" The rest of the document is completely one sided with absolutely nothing that I agree with. My opinion, evidence, etc.. was nowhere to be found. It was filed an entered by the court on May 13. I just received the document yesterday. Is this legal what the attorney did? What can I do? Thank you.",

        "Good advice has been provided by my colleagues. Filing a unilateral report is the best option for you right now. Be sure to monitor the case for any hearings that might be scheduled and make sure you \"appear\" at the hearing. I understand the issue with lack of funds to hire an attorney, but representing yourself in an adversary proceeding is not easy. Perhaps you can locate a bankruptcy attorney in your area that will provide some guidance for a reasonable fee.",
        "Yes, they can, should they without true joint agreements, no. You do not say whether any of what is agreeable is in it, and so if it is nothing you agreed to or would agree to then file a declaration stating you did not agree. Be ready to explain why you could not meet and confer and state you do not agree at the hearing. Again, not everything needed to answer this question was stated in your question. Tell the court BEFORE the hearing that you did not jointly file. Then at the hearing explain why you didn't meet and confer and agree to the stipulation and ask them to not approve.",

    "title": "Debts incurred immediately before bankruptcy ?",
    "question": "I have been informally told that there is a rule , that one may not discharge debts in chapter 7 bankruptcy, if the debts are incurred within 90 days of the filing. I am on the verge of filing chapter 7 , but have very recently incurred a large medical bill and was wondering if the inference of bankruptcy fraud would apply to a medical bill as well? Would I need to wait 90 days for this to be discharged , or does this rule only apply to luxury items and cash advances , and the like ?",

        "As usual, Mr. Granvold gives an excellent description of many of the basic issues in a bankruptcy and I fully agree with him. In 37 years I have seen too many disasters resulting from people trying to save money only to lose many times over because they did not know the law or got an attorney who just does not know the law that well.\n\nThis is not about filling out papers. This is about timing, exemption planning, protecting other people you do not want harmed by your filing.\n\nI would note that under the California Uniform Fraudulant Transfer Act, bankruptcy trustees can go back much further than a year. The base period is 2 years and can go back as much as 7 years in certain circumstances. The bankruptcy trustees here in Sacramento know this and use it to go after payments made beyond that covered by the Bankruptcy Code. It is not uncommon to see people who waited a year beyond payments to relatives that file only to have the bankruptcy trustee go after the funds paid to relatives and actually get the money back to pay to all creditors. I taught a class on this issue a few years back and was suprised at how many bankruptcy attorneys did not know this.\n\nDo yourself a huge favor and schedule an appointment with the best bankruptcy lawyer you can find. Check out Avvo ratings and check out the attorney endorsements. These are the people who know the good from the bad. You can also check for California State Bar Certified Bankruptcy Law Specialists. The state bar awards those to around 1/10 of 1% of attorneys so you can pretty well know you are not getting a dud. I think the last time I looked there was about 156 Bankruptcy Specialists in the whole of California, and a large percentage worked for big corporations. I think that there are less than 100 who represent consumer debtors like you.\nI hope this helps. Good luck.",
        "\"Fraud\" is fraud no matter if you wait 100 days or 1 day! But the I have never seen a creditor listed file a claim for fraud in my 8,400 cases in the last 29 years..very doubtful. The real issue is you want to discuss this with an experienced bankruptcy attorney filing as there are many other issues and facts I will set forth below that affect your filing! It is smart to think about the exceptions too as you are..but bad advice is \"bad advice\" . Simple as that. Thus DONT listen to non bankruptcy attorneys..only listen to someone knowing the law..an experienced bankruptcy attorney. You can look at 11 USC 523 and see the exceptions..but I would just discuss with an attorney as it is possible you will be waiting anyway because of money or other reasons the attorney discusses with you.\n\nYou need and want to enjoy your fresh start also. But the most important thing is to meet with an attorney as you asking this question means you have not. You care about 2 goals: keeping everything you have equity in and discharging all your debts. If you don't have any of the exceptions to discharge you will obtain that goal; most exceptions are set forth in 11 USC. 523 (Google it) like child support, some income taxes, traffic (in a ch 7) and criminal fines , and presumption of student loans. But some debts are dischargeable in a ch 13 but NOT in a ch 7 so you want to make sure and your attorney will discuss any such types with you also!\n\nYour exemptions depend on what state you have lived in in the last 2 years and thus if in your state, then your states exemptions will apply. Most persons filing keep everything they own but your attorney will confirm that with you when they learn everything you own and the equity thereof!\n\nSome secured debts like homes, vehicles, other secured debts an attorney will discuss your options on also as you must list any debts; but that does not mean you will lose them unless you have too much equity or are in default on paying for them! Discuss those options if they apply with your attorney too.\n\nBut other issues can arise that can greatly harm your case. Just one example: If you paid back a relative $3,000 11 months ago and now file bankruptcy next week, the trustee can SUE that relative to retrieve that $3,000 (under what is called a preference) for the benefit of the bankruptcy estate. As a result, most attorneys don't charge to meet with them the first meeting so meet with one no matter what.\n\nMany great attorneys can be found right here on AVVO in your state so look, call, and meet one as soon as you can.\n\nYou should also want to know when to file: is there an advantage of waiting versus filing now and who should you pay between now and then! Good luck and enjoy your later fresh start.",
        "As mentioned, it may depend on the type of medical work you had done. Generally, you probably do not have an issue with discharging the recent medical bill. In my experience, medical bills are almost always discharged. However, it would be best for you to consult with a bankruptcy attorney to discuss your situation more thoroughly.",
        "Actually, the rule is cash advances and luxury purchases made within seventy days of filing are presumed fraudulent under certain circumstances. It is just a presumption and the Creditor still have to file a legal action in your bankruptcy. As the other attorney said, unless it was for unnecessary cosmetic type procedures, I don't think you have anything to worry about.",
        "It depends on what type of medical debt. If the medical debt was for a procedure that is not considered necessary then the creditor may have an argument that the debt is similar to a luxury item or if you paid for the medical services by taking a cash advance, then there is a presumption that the debt is not discharged.\n\nA presumption means the creditor has to take action on the debt to have it declared non dischargeable and failure to take action means the debt is discharged. There is a deadline for the creditor to take action. The creditor must file the adversary action within 60 days of the first creditors meeting.\n\nIf the creditor is going to challenge the debt, then the creditor will more than likely contact your attorney and you may either settle the debt (reaffirm all or part) or defend against the creditors adversary action.\n\nYou know whether the medical debt was necessary and if unnecessary wait the 90 days unless you have another reason for filing, such as a foreclosure or other emergency, then you should consult with a competent attorney in your area .",
        "Absent some sort of fraud. I do not think you have anything to worry about. If you are concerned whatsoever, you can always wait the 90 days before filing."

    "answers": [
        "So, as stated above, you will need to reopen your bankruptcy in order to file a motion to avoid lien real property. Generally, a judgment lien is not automatically eliminated in the bankruptcy. You have to bring a motion to have it avoided.\n\nSo, the key part of this motion is to what extent does the lien impair the exemption on the real property. You need to look at your petition, specifically, Schedule A, Schedule C and Schedule D. Does the exemption on the real property cover the equity of the real property (i.e., were you able to exempt the real property when you filed). However, you can always amend Schedule A, Schedule C, and Schedule D when you reopen the case to reflect the true situation at the time of filing.\n\nI would not recommend you do this yourself. You will need a bankruptcy attorney to help you with the motion.",
        "what everyone said is correct, before you go spending a lot of money the first thing you should do is call the attorney's office for the creditor and ask if they will remove it for free or if not if they will take a couple hundred bucks for their effort.",
        "I concur with my colleagues (assuming the judgment lien has attached to any real estate you own. If you don't own any real estate, the lien has not had any adverse effect on you). Strategy: (1) Call FIA's atty directly and request the lien be voluntarily released; if necessary offer payment of $2-300 for their costs in releasing the lien; (2) If FIA won't do it, you must reopen your closed case for the purpose of filing a Motion under 11 USC ยง522(f) to avoid the judgment lien; (3) You must follow specific rules on how the Notice of Motion and Motion are filed. Institutional lenders must be served by certified mail, RRR. (4) If you don't receive any opposition to the motion, you must prepare and file additional documents with the court resulting in a court Order avoiding the judgment lien. There are lots of moving parts in these steps, so without the help of a knowledgeable BK lawyer, you are entering a legal minefield. One false step and BOOM! The BK judges hold you to the same standards as lawyers and they don't appreciate the extra time pro se movants cost them. If you need further help, I can send you some of the forms, or tell you how to get them.",
        "As the other attorneys have said, you need an order you can record. Yu could wait the 10 years until the debt expires, BUT, when you go to sell the real property, the title company may want the lien paid. IF FIA does try to collect or renew the judgment, you can go after them for trying to collect on a discharged debt.",
        "You may get lucky and they will release the lien for free, but more likely, you are going to need to hire an attorney to negotiate for you and they will release the lien for $500 to $1500.00. If you call, they will blow you off. Get a lawyer.",
        "If you didn't get an order avoiding the judgment lien, you'll have to reopen the case and do so. You're probably going to need an attorney to assist you.",
        "Did you get an order avoiding a judgment lien? If so, just record a certified copy of that order with the county recorder's office. If not, much work ahead to reopen & file a motion to avoid judgment lien. I have seen inexperienced attorneys take a year or more to correctly handle the noticing requirements, which differ significantly from the noticing that is customary in state courts. Hope this perspective helps!",
        "Not enough details here to figure out how to answer this.\n\nFirst of all, did you own any real property when your Chapter 7 case was filed?\n\nSecond of all, if you did not own any real property when your Chapter 7 case was filed, what is the lien liening?\n\nGenerally when a creditor files an Abstract of Judgment in CA it becomes a general lien on all real property that is not exempt from levy.\n\nIf you did not own any real property at the time, then there was nothing to lien against.\n\nWhat you ought to do, if there is no property against which this lien can lien, you should file a motion to expunge the Abstract of Judgment and then file the order expunging it in the county recorders office and in every county where it was filed.\n\nPlease review In Re: Thomas, 102 B.R. 199 (Bankr.

    "question": "I am writing for a friend.",
    "answers": [
        "In addition to what the two previous attorneys have stated, your friend may be eligible for a fee waiver. If the fee waiver is granted, all court costs would be waived for him in his matter. The costs waived would include filing fee and certification of any orders and Letters. However, the client would still be responsible for the costs for the publication, and probate referee's fee.",
        "Of course it can be done. If the \"estate\" does not have a TRust, then the estate must be probated and then that requires that attorney fees be paid at the conclusion of the probate case and ONLY then. If the estate involves administration of a trust, then yes attorney fees could be attached to the value of the trust for payment and most trusts, if done right, allow attorney fees to be paid from the estate on behalf of the work of the successor trustee. Have you friend make phone calls to any AVVO attorney on this list who does probate. If he is out of state, then it is best that he hire a probate attorney. I've done estates for parties out of state very often.",
        "I am assuming this is a probate estate? In any event, if there is enough equity in the house to cover likely attorney fees, you shouldn't have too much problem. The fees are set by law in probate, so you have a pretty good idea of what they will be going in. Also, for all unsecured debts, such as the medical bills, the expense of administration, which includes executor and attorney fees, comes off the top before creditors can be paid. There's also often a lot that can be done with medical debt, too. And yes, we do handle probate administration.",
        "With families spread all over the country, your friend's situation is very common. His first step is to gather as much information as he can about what his mother owned and owed without making a trip to San Diego. If his mother had a Will or Trust it would be helpful to have that available.\n\nHis second step is to contact an attorney here to start the process. If there are mortgages on the property, then acting sooner instead of later is important. When you speak with the attorney, it will be helpful to have your family address and phone book handy. If you have brothers or sisters, the attorney will need their contact information as part of the probate process.\n\nIn California Probates, the attorneys get paid at the end. The necessary upfront expenses are the filing fees (which you sometimes can get a deferral as to when they must be paid) and the publication fee (about $200). As one of the prior responders mentioned, it might be possible for your friend to be paid for his work in administering the estate, even if there is not enough to cover the decedent's ordinary bills.",
        "There certainly are attorneys out there that can work with fees on a probate matter. We cannot solicit business on AVVO however so please use the Find a Lawyer tab and call a few. You will find one."

    "title": "I transferred car to family member in 2013 due to abusive husband and his addiction. Need to file chapter 7. How to handle?",
    "question": "In 2012 husband became addicted to illegal drugs, had been selling property for cash to obtain drugs. I put my car title to family member to protect it from being sold for drugs in 2013. Lost home to foreclosure in 2015, tried to save it with Chap 13 in 2014 but he did not make payments. I need to file Chap 7 so that I can get back to a normal life now that I have left him. I have a default judgement (2014) from credit card company that I fear will attach my wages once I get a job. I just need: #1 to know how to explain on paper, where (which schedule/form) and how to word it. #2 Need to know if I should put car back in my name or just leave it as is (thinking it might be time barred). (I have read the CA Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act and other info on this and do not know how to proceed.) Thank you for your time.",

        "I agree with my colleagues that you should consult and retain an attorney for your chapter 7 filing. You should report the vehicle on property you have transferred on the statement of financial affairs. You should list the year, make, model of the car and the approximate value of the vehicle today. Does it have a lien on it? If so you would list that too because that means it has less equity, if any. You do not need to transfer it back into your name but you want to make sure if it was transferred back into your name you would be able to protect it with one of your exemptions, depending on whether you are using 704 or 703 exemptions. Hope this helps.",
        "As you have seen from other attorneys, it is worth hiring an experienced bankruptcy attorney in your area to assist you with this and to make sure that this is done correctly.\n\nJust from the facts that you have stated, it would appear that you have maintained an \"equitable interest\" under California law in that vehicle, but transferred the \"legal title\" only. If that is true, the car would be listed on your schedules as your property and claimed as exempt.\n\nThere is a catch to this though. You didn't mention if you were ever divorced. If not, you would need the cooperation of your husband (to sign a waiver or file with you) to maximize your available exemptions. If you are married, filing alone and your husband does not sign a waiver, your exemption for the value of the car will be more limited.\n\nGet a free consultation and get some real answers. There is no way to give you full and accurate answers here since there is a lot more information that will need to be discussed. Many attorneys can do this by phone.",

    "title": "Protect myself from my wife's spending habit before our legal separation or divorce",
    "question": "Our marriage is over(both agreed) and we were going to file a legal separation for health insurance purposes. Also I wanted to protect myself from my wife's credit card spending habit. But my tax person told me that I should hold off to file it until next year due to my tax purpose. I make too much money to file as a single; tax will hit me hard and have to pay more than I am withholding it. Is there any way that I can protect myself from my wife's spending until next year? Could I get a signature from her that stated whatever she spent after tomorrow, I am not responsible for it? Or legal separation is the only way? Please advise. Thank you.",

        "Ummm, cancel your credit card accounts ?",
        "Tax status is different then protecting yourself from your wife's spending habits. Once you file for legal separation, then the date of separation protects you from any negligent transactions after the legal separation is declared on the petition and agreed to by the parties. You are protected from her negligence after the date of separation is established even though a final judgment has not yet been entered. Suggest you hire legal counsel to do other important work to protect your interests.",

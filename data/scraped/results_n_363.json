    "title": "How do I fill out my SC-105?",
    "question": "I sued someone in small claims, but she filed for bankruptcy before our court date. I received a notice that the case had been stayed due to her bankruptcy filing. It was my understanding that I did not need to attend our court date, but then I received notice that the case had been dismissed since neither party appeared. Now I'm told I need to fill out an SC-105 to reinstate my case. How do I do this?",

        "You have the option of filing a Motion for Relief from teh Automatic Stay or you can file a Complaint to Determine this Dischargeability of the debt. Must have compelling cause to win in either case.",
        "If the debt owed to you falls under the definitions under 11USC section 523 for non-dischargability, you should pursue the matter in bankrutpcy court. If it doesn't, there isn't much point to requesting relief from stay to reinstate your case, as the debt will be discharged and the case would become moot.\nTalk to a bankruptcy attorney to determine if the the debt might not be dischargable, then you will know the correct course of action.",
        "I agree in toto with Attorney Steingraber. The automatic stay in bankruptcy applies to your case and you can't do anything until the stay is removed by the bankruptcy court or the case is dismissed. I can't speculate to the likelihood of either without a lot more facts. You may wish to consult with a bankruptcy attorney regarding your options.",
        "You don't file another SC-105 unless you can first convince the BK court to lift the stay created by the debtor's filing. You cannot refile or revise your claim in state court. At this time, your only remedy is in the bankruptcy court. You have not provided any details concerning why the debtor owes you any money. If the debt was incurred because of some deception, false statements, or other intentional conduct you may seek to have your debt determined to be non-dischargeable in the BK court. For this, you will need to hire an experience BK creditor's rights lawyer. Since your small claims venue only accepts limited monetary amounts (up to $10K) it may not warrant spending money for a lawyer.

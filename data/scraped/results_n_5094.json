        "Once she files for divorce and you are served, no one can sell, give or divide any property assets or debts without the other person agreeing to it. Also, no one can take the children without an agreement on custody and visitation. I suggest that you also see an attorney right away to lay a strategy of what needs to be done and possibly begin a process of amicably resolving the issues of the divorce.",
        "I recommend retaining an attorney and talking to your wife to see whether mediation is possible. If you are able to negotiate with the help of a mediator, you and your family may be able to save a great deal of money, stress, and time. Please read the links below for further information and feel free to contact me directly to answer any questions you may have. Best of luck.",

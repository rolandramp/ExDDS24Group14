        "In the Central District of California, there are workshops for debtors considering whether to sign a reaffirmation agreement. Contact the court. Additionally, pro se debtors (or debtors representing themselves) are often required to appear before a judge before the reaffirmation agreement is allowed to go into effect. At those hearings are volunteer attorneys who will explain the details of the reaffirmation agreement.",
        "If your husband is not on the auto loan in the first place, he should definitely not sign the reaffirmation agreement, as doing so would only obligate him for this auto debt that he was not even liable for before filing the bankruptcy The fact that he is a \"joint debtor\" in the bankruptcy is irrelevant. The term \"joint debtor\" may be confusing you. For purposes of the bankruptcy paperwork, the term refers to the fact that you and your husband filed your bankruptcy case together, as a married couple is permitted to do under the federal code (thereby saving on additional filing fees and likely attorney costs). For purposes of the reaffirmation agreement, it is intended to refer to any other person that owes that specific debt with you, as is often found when somebody co-signs for a loan for another.",
        "If you are going to reaffirm, you would sign by yourself as \"debtor\". As you can see from the other answers, whether to reaffirm or not is something you should really think about. There is a possibility, depending on your lender, that they might repossess even if the payments are current if you do not reaffirm. If you have a lot of equity in the vehicle, such as if the car is nearly paid off, then you may want to protect your investment and eliminate the risk by reaffirming. If you have little or no equity in the vehicle, then that would be an acceptable risk to not reaffirm.",
        "I agree, you should not be signing a reaffirmation agreement. As the other attorneys said, most lenders will accept payments without a reaffirmation agreement. And there is little or no benefit to you to reaffirm the debt. The lender is the only party that will benefit from reaffirmation. Finally, even if you sign the reaffirmation agreement, the judge may or may not allow the agreement, depending on your income and expenses as disclosed in your bankruptcy schedules.",
        "If you are not reaffirming the debt you do not sign the agreement. If you are not on the original loan there is no need for you to reaffirm a debt you were never obligated to in the first place. If you are reaffirming the debt then you sign where it says debtor.",
        "Ms Bunce is correct ... it doesn't really matter; but why are you bothering to reaffirm the debt? Is the car worth more than what is owed? Who is the lender?\n\nEven though lawyers representing car companies will repeatedly tell you that \"retain and pay is not an option\" ... in fact, it is. Perhaps not according to the BK Code - but practically speaking, nearly all lenders will let you keep up the payments and retain the car without reaffirming.",
        "I don't think it really matters one way or another, but if it was me, I wouldn't have your spouse sign it and would sign where it says \"debtor.\" Hope this perspective helps!"

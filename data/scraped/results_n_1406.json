    "title": "Can a property equalization payment from a MSA be discharged in a Chapter 13 BK?",
    "question": "I recently completed a marital settlement agreement about 7 months ago. I owe about $28,000 as a property equalization payment that is due at the end of the year. If I declare Chapter 13 BK, can I get it washed?",

        "I agree with the other attorney answers and concerns that have been expressed. I also recommend you find a skilled bankruptcy attorney to advise you on this.\n\nI would note one additional concern with what you described beyond those already expressed. Given how recent the marital settlement was entered into, I would be concerned that there may be an argument made that it was entered into fraudulently, i.e. with no intent to actually perform it. I am not saying that is the case, only that it may be an argument to challenge whether the Chapter 13 is proposed in \"good faith.\"\n\nThe final consideration will be whether a Chapter 13 plan can be formulated that works. It may be that a Chapter 13 can be filed but income be such that a good faith plan using all disposable income would cause it to pay the debt anyway.\n\nThere is no way to know without a complete analysis of your situation. You should get your situation reviewed by a skilled bankruptcy attorney.",
        "My experience is that bankruptcy judges are reluctant to wipe out provisions of marital settlement agreements, but a ch 13 can, at least, get you five years to pay the $28,000.00, rather than pay the lump sum by December 31, 2015. See the link to NACBA below for help in finding a ch 13 bankruptcy lawyer to consult.",
        "As stated by other counsel: it all depends. There are a number of factors that can go into a challange as to the dischargability of debt from a marital dissolution. Just because the wording says equalization doesn't mean your ex can't argue its support.\nContact a good bankruptcy attorney in your area and discuss the issue with him/her.",
        "Maybe. It depends on the language in the MSA. If the equalization payment is considered support it is not dischargeable. Get an appt with a BK lawyer in your area. Some offer a free consultation.",
        "The simple legal answer is yes, property equalization payments are dischargeable in Chapter 13, but factually speaking there are many moving parts in determining the dischargeability of portions of a marital settlement agreement. In addition, to get the discharge, you have to survive the Chapter 13 process. That almost never happens without a good attorney to walk you through the minefield, so make sure that you sit down with a local Chapter 13 attorney to discuss all of your options. Many offer free consultations."

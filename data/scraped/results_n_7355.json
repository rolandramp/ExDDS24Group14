    "title": "I am planning a strategic default on my under-water home. Will the IRS may tax me with a 1099? Will a form 982 protect me?",
    "question": "My house is $70,000 under water and I am planning a strategic default. I look at it as a bad investment. The house is my sole residence, and has never been refinanced. My concern is the IRS. I worry about the IRS taxing me on the difference between what I owe on the house, and whatever the bank gets for it. I'm told the difference may be considered taxable income. Would I likely receive a form 1099 from the IRS? Can I file a form 982 to make the \"income\" from the 1099 non-taxable?",

        "This is not really a tax response, but it is very much worth noting. I've seen quite a few people go through a strategic default and no one gave them the advice that they should get a deficiency waiver from the bank. The deficiency waiver says that the bank relinquishes its right to come after you for any of the unpaid debt. Receiving a 1099 for the forgiving debt does NOT release you from the debt.\n\nYou need to negotiate this with the bank and the bank may require you to pony up a little more money to get the waiver. This will be money well spent.\n\nWhat we are seeing in Florida is the banks are selling the defaulted mortgages in bulk to collection agencies for pennies on the dollar. The collection agency then uses aggressive tactics to collect on the unpaid part of the mortgage. They can lien other assets, garnish wages, etc, etc. It can be real nasty for someone like yourself that could have paid the debt but did not.\n\nI hope this adds a little useful information to the prior good answers.",

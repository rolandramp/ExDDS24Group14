        "If you have an order avoid the lien then you need to obtain a certified copy of this order from the bankruptcy court and then take that certified copy to the county recorder's office to be recorded on the title to your property. Recording the order avoiding the lien will \"remove\" the line. If you do not have an order grating the avoidance of the lien then that is whole other problem. A lien is not removed simply by filing bankruptcy. A motion to avoid the lien must be filed an order granting that motion must be signed by the Judge. If that motion to avoid the lien was never filed then I would consult with a couple experienced bankruptcy attorneys to see if you can reopen your bankruptcy case to file that motion or if you should file a new case.",
        "Liens survive the bankruptcy discharge. Only your personal liability was discharged. First find a bankruptcy attorney in your area that can help you determine if you were eligible to 'stip' the lien. If you were, hire the attorney to reopen your case and file the Motion to Strip the Lien and assess whether reopening the case would cause any other issues.",
        "While I agree with the information of the other responses in general, more information is needed to properly answer your question. Specifically, what Chapter bankruptcy you filed and whether the lien is a judicial lien (ie. Judgment lien) or a consensual lien (ie. Equity line of credit, second mortgage). A consensual junior lien cannot be avoided in a Chapter 7 case, only Chapter 13. If you filed a Chapter 7 or 13 and the lien was a judgment lien, then you can have your original bankruptcy case reopened to file to have it removed.",
        "As noted, if you are eligible to avoid (or remove) the lien, and you neglected to do so while the case was open, you can file a motion to reopen the case. If the case is reopened, you can then file a motion to avoid the lien. Any licensed bankruptcy attorney in your district can do this for you.",
        "As Ms. Rode responded above, if you were in a chapter 13 plan which included an order avoiding the junior lien as fully unsecured, and you obtained a discharge, then you are entitled to have the lien removed either by recording a judgment on the lien (which will need to be signed by a Bankruptcy Judge) or by getting the current lienholder to voluntarily reconvey.\n\nIn some instances a chapter 13 petitioner can be entitled to attorney fees if the lienholder does not cooperate with reconveying the deed of trust."

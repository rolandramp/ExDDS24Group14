    "title": "How long after a Default Judgment is entered against me can the Plaintiff start enforcing their judgment?",
    "question": "I was just served with a Summons and Complaint for Breach of Contract and Common Counts from a collection agency law firm. The debt is still collectable within the statute of limitations. I was thinking of not answering the Complaint and looking into Bankruptcy. I can't afford a wage assignment and do not want them to obtain an Abstract of Judgment before I file the bankruptcy Petition. I am trying to buy more time without having to incur the cost of filing a Response. Is there a 30 day wait after the Default judgment is entered that they have to wait to enforce the judgment or can they enforce right away.",
    "answers": [
        "As the other attorneys mentioned, there is no \"hold\" period. Your options might include: 1) requesting a fee waiver and file a general denial answer (thereby giving you more time); 2) file your BK and thereby obtaining a stay of the civil case/judgment enforcement; or 3) fighting the lawsuit if you believe you have a valid defense.",
        "They can start collecting as soon as they obtain a writ. There is no hold. I would respond to the complaint in a timely fashion to buy yourself time to evaluate options. Talk to a local lawyer ASAP.",
        "If you are already considering bankruptcy protection, you probably already know that the civil case will be stayed as soon as you file your petition, and as long as that occurs before the abstract of judgment is issued and recorded, you have avoided any lien against real property that you may own. Even if you file after that point in time, you can request the court to remove the lien, although of course that will be more troublesome and costly. Bring these issues up with your bankruptcy attorney. Good luck.",
        "Unlike a small claims court judgment, there is no 30 day wait period after a superior court judgment is entered. The enforcement can take place as soon as the judgment is entered.\n\nYou are better off filing an Answer or General Denial, and applying for a fee waiver. Even if your fee waiver is denied, you will have a bit more time to pay your fees before the court voids/cancels the filing of your Answer or General Denial.\n\nThe form for the Answer is (Judicial Council Form PLD-C-010):\n\nhttp://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/pldc010.pdf\n\nThe form for the General Denial is (Judicial Council Form PLD-050):\n\nhttp://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/pld050.pdf\n\nRegarding fee waivers, see:\n\nhttp://www.courts.ca.gov/selfhelp-lowcosthelp.htm"

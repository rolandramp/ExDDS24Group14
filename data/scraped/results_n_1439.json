    "title": "What happens if you sue someone with no money?",
    "question": "We are all named in the Plaintiff's lawsuit. They are seeking judgement money against us. One of us is disabled and is on O.D.S.P. while the other one is the landlord of the house. Do they determine how much money they want from us for infliction of emotional distress or harassment? Can you go to jail if we are unable to pay our debts? Will we be in debt to them FOREVER with accumulating interest over times? Can they go after our personal belongings such as clothing, TV, computer, and etc?",
    "answers": [
        "There is no debtor's prison in the U.S., but you may have to attend a examination of your assets to determine whether you are able to pay anything towards the judgment. Also, filing BK may be an option. Good luck to you.",
        "There are exemptions that vary by state and federal law. However, disability benefits are almost always exempted from the collection of a creditor's judgment. America thankfully does not have debtor's prisons.",
        "If you lose, you will get a judgment against you, that is good for 10 years, and can be renewed indefinitely.\n\nInterest accrues at 10% per year.\n\nNo, you will not go to jail for not paying the debts."

        "I agree with other respondents to this post. You should contact an experienced consumer defense attorney to discuss the options of your particular case. An attorney can discuss with you the specific causes of action you have been sued on, what defenses may or may not apply, and can negotiate with your creditor on your behalf if you wish to make a settlement. Be cautious not to let your statute of limitations run, which is typically 30 days from the date you were served with the lawsuit. If you do not respond to the lawsuit within this time you may face a default on the case and be unable to respond to the case. Additionally, if default is entered the creditor may be less cooperative with any settlement negotiations. The National Association of Consumer Advocates (NACA) is a great resource when looking for a local consumer rights attorney. Their website is www.naca.net and they have an attorney list online. Most attorney members of NACA will provide free initial consultations as well.",
        "You should consult a lawyer. A lawyer can negotiate a better settlement than you can on your own. Whatever you do, do not allow a default judgment to be entered against you. You have 30 days from the date of service of the Summons and Complaint to file a pleading (usually an Answer) with the court, denying liability or the amount thereof and setting forth any of about 40 possible affirmative defenses which may be applicable. The court will charge a filing fee, but the court's filing fee can be waived if you are without funds. There are court forms and information sheets about the requirements and procedure involved in waiving the court filing fee.",
        "The home page of my website, below, has several short videos on your options, when receiving a debt collection lawsuit. You need to be aware that the response is due within 30 days of being served (see my blog, link below). That should be enough time to explore your options and consult with an experienced debt collection DEFENSE attorney and find out what that costs and what to expect. For this amount of money, definitely consult with an attorney sooner rather than later.\n\nRobert Stempler (please see DISCLAIMER below)\nwww.StopCollectionLawsuits.com\nwww.facebook.com/SoCalConsumerLawyer\nTwitter: @RStempler",
        "You will need to respond to their summons so that Wells Fargo does not get a default judgment against you. This will also buy you some time to either get an attorney or to negotiate with their attorney to see if they will enter into some settlement with you. The lawsuit will most likely continue forward so hiring an attorney would be in your best interest.",
        "The time to make payments on this debt is over. You should probably file a written response with the court to oppose this suit to buy time to make an offer to settle this debt, and by all means, hire a litigation defense attorney to represent you if you feel you can't complete the paperwork & handle negotiations on your own. Hope this perspective helps!"

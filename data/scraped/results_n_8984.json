    "question": "I'm Canadian citizen on H1B. I was laid off 1 month ago. Now the new employer is in the process of transfering my H1B. I was told it will take 3-4 weeks to get it transferred.",
    "answers": [
        "I will agree with the previous attorney. Also did your employer affirmatively revoke the H1B? If no, then next step is to know if you received a receipt from the new transfer. If yes, under AC 21, you should be able to start working for the new company. Often if approved, the USCIS might refer the case to a consular processing. I will recommend two things:\n\n1. Go for premium processing;\n2.

        "You can, but at arguably significant risk. Such a delayed filing for extension of status is unwise. If you apply for an extension after lay off, then the new I-94 is often denied.

As a result, H1-b visa processing outside the U.S. can be delayed causing more frustration.\n\nDue to the Neufeld memo, on what constitutes a valid employer-petition, many H1-b visas are being re-examined and denied for reasons that do not seem to be based upon the law and related H1-b regulations.

        "If you paid from your separate property income any payments on community property debts, then you could be due a reimbursement from the other party.",
        "This means that if you continued to pay for debts that were run up during marriage (by both or either or you) and you paid those debts after separation (so with separate property earnings), then you are entitled to reimbursement from your ex for 1/2 of those amounts (because you reduced the community debt with your separate property earnings). You can request credits by showing your ex proof of the payments and requesting those credits in your papers (with proof of payment as an exhibit attached).",
        "These may be any payments made for preserving the community property with separate property assets. This question is difficult to answer without knowing more about the finances of your marriage. I suggest that you seek to have guidance with an attorney on a limited scope to discuss these matters in addition to the additional information that the attorney will need in order to advise you on how to answer this question. Without additional information, it is difficult in giving you a specific answer for your particular marriage."

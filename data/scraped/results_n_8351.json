    "title": "Can I put a lien on someone's assets to ensure payment of debt?",
    "question": "I am a California resident. An associates wants me to loan him 200k. The loan will be in a form of a line of credit. Everything will be in writing. The borrower has several pieces of real estate with equity on it. I would like to know is there a way for me to put a lien on his real estate property for the loan amount, register the lien with the county recorder so as to ensure that in case the debt is not paid, I can have access to his equity and get my money. I am very much interested in the process of putting the lien and having it be recorded. Thanks in advance.",

        "Is your associate willing to grant you a lien on his property? If so, then you can have an attorney prepare a note and deed of trust to make sure that you have a valid lien on his property. Also, make sure that the attorney has a title search performed. You do not want to get the lien only to find out that there is no equity in the property or that you are severely undersecured. You also want to discuss with your associate who will pay the closing costs.\n\n[I am a Virginia-licensed attorney.

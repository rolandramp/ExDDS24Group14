        "I agree with my colleagues. In California, two or more person sharing profits is considered a partnership whether or not profits were actually made. In your verbal agreement, the percentage breakdown would be considered profit sharing. Therefore you are in a partnership.

        "These oral agreements are enforceable, although it's always harder to enforce an oral agreement, which is why is best to put things in writing. You should take partnership arrangements more seriously, since partners are liable for each other's debts, even if you think you \"held all the debt\" in this partnership. Your original partnership deal, if it lacked a specific dissolution mechanism would be governed by CA partnership law, and a leaving member would generally be entitled to the value of their share at the time they leave.\n\nYou should hire a lawyer to prepare written agreements that spells out the respective rights and responsibilities of those involved, so you can provide for the necessary meetings and consequences for not meeting obligations. For your prior arrangement, you need a buyout agreement, and a new partnership agreement, or an independent contractor agreement.

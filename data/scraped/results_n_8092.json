    "title": "How soon can citibank garnish wages/bank accounts in California after a judgement? Can they enter my home to take things?",
    "question": "I've just been served. Credit card is suing me for $32,000 I owe. They mailed me an offer a few months ago to settle for around $7,000, but we didn't have it then. We can probably have $6,000 to offer ($2,000 now, $2,000 each of the next two months), but we have other debts to settle. Our $70,000 HELOC is past due since December, we have a few medical bills past due (around $2,000 total) and another small credit card past due. Our home is foreclosing (will probably be sold in July/August) and we're emigrating to another country in a few months although we still intend to settle unresolved debts from there.",

        "Attorney Frank is right, as usual. If you don't answer the complain, you will have no leverage with the creditor.

        "If you have just been served with the summons and complaint in the Citibank collection case, you have 30 days to answer.

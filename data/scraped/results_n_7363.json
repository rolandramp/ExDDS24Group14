    "title": "Include lump sum workers comp award as income in chapter 7 means test?",
    "question": "Lump sum was received but check has not yet been cashed. I know that if this is income it will make passing the means test much harder. (I am not concerned with the exemption issue as I can exempt the 12k amount). I just need to know if it is \"Income\" that will greatly inflate my means test.",

        "Communication is important. If you had a WC Attorney, you should have told him that you were contemplating BK. If you did, he could have structured your settlement to minimize the impact. If you did not, then you may be stuck with income at a most inconvenient time. You would have been better off settling your Future Medical after your Chap 7 was finalized.\n\nA BK Attorney might be able to control the damage by alleging that the payment is supposed to last for your 20-40 year life expectancy, but I honestly do not know the Chap 7 rules. The simple fact is that you now have 12K in your hand that could be used to pay your bills. That is tough to get past.",
        "For what period is the worker's comp covered? I think that there is an excellent argument that you should include only that which covers the six months prior to the filing date. If, for example, this lump sum is for 12 months of coverage at $1,000 per month, I think you can put $6,000 in the means test (or $1,000 per month) because the statute refers to income 'derived during the 6-month period. This is the kind of reason why you should hire an attorney to do your bankruptcy for you. He or she can confirm the local caselaw treatment and, if necessary, speak to the U.S. Trustee's office about their interpretation to help you determine whether it is going to be a real issue or not.",
        "Yes, it would be considered income for Chapter 7 Means Test purposes. However, please note that the income shown on the means test should reflect an average of the income you have received over the 6 months prior to filing your petition (with the 6 period ending at the end of the last completed month prior to filing). If doing so negatively affects your ability to \"pass\" the means test, I would recommend consulting a local attorney to look over your means test to see if maybe there are additional deductions you might be overlooking or to see if the deductions you are claiming have been calculated correctly."

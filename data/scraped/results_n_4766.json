    "title": "How to find my last credit card payment delinquent date to calculate if my debt has met statute of limitation or not?",
    "question": "I have several credit cards debt from 3-5 years ago. I know that CA statute of limitations is 4 years, however, when I pulled my credit report, it doesn't clearly tell me when the last delinquent date is in order for me to accurately calculate if each account is statute barred or not. If I don't have my credit card statements anymore and all of the original creditors (banks) sold my debts to collection agencies, then how do I find out the last 'accurate' delinquent dates?",
    "answers": [
        "Check with the collection agency.",
        "You can figure out your delinquent date using a little bit of math and your credit report. As copied from the Experian website verbatim: \"If you obtain a report directly from Experian, each account will list the 'date the account is scheduled to remain on file until,' which is calculated using the original delinquency date as reported by the creditor. Simply subtract seven years from that date to determine the original delinquency date.\"",
        "I would agree that contacting the junk debt buyer who now owns the account is not the best option to find this information. They often don't know it either. They know when the original company charged it off. I suggest as another lawyer told you, go to your bank statements.\nIf you are sued on one of these cases, I strongly suggest you seek legal counsel from someone who regularly handles these credit card cases. I think one of the attorneys that answered your questions handles these cases. The junk debt buyers never seem to have the documents necessary to pursue these claims and they can be dismissed or withdrawn without any payment by you.",
        "Check with your bank, if you paid by check. Find the dates when you last made payments from your bank account.\n\nYou may not want to contact the collection agencies because once they are in contact with you, you can expect regular telephonic communication. Also, the collection agencies may have only the \"charge off\" date, not the \"Date of default.\" The original creditors may have you account information in their computer system and may be able to tell you when you made your last payment."

    "title": "Can I sell my home and keep any profit in the home if the banks starts foreclosure because of missed payments?",
    "question": "I've been in my home since 1990. I would really like to keep my home but because of hardships and Wells Fargo raising my payments and falling behind on my payments . Wells Fargo has given me a date of may 23 2019 of the sale of my home just a few weeks away. Ive tried to get re- modified three times but I was turned down because of lack of income I also have that \"Pick a Payment Loan\" that was given to me back in 2007. In which Wells Fargo has been sued and was told to give their clients a new loan. Still as of today I still have that same loan they haven't given me a new loan or will they re modify because of lack of income. I'm in foreclosure and I just don't know what to do to save myself from losing my home . I need help and cant seem to find any. Is there a simple fix to any of this or am I dead in the water? I could really use some advise if there is any. Please help. thank you.",

        "You can sell your house, but the sale must be completed before any foreclosure sale takes place. I would speak to some real estate agents immediately and let them know you are behind on your mortgage payments. You can also keep applying for a modification with Wells Fargo at the same time which may buy you some additional time. If you are in review for a modification, Wells Fargo will likely postpone the foreclosure sale. You have the option of a chapter 13 to save your home, however, that would require making (affording) the payments moving forward plus a catch up payment (plan payment) which, depending on your whole financial picture would be at least the amount you are behind divided over a 36-60 month plan. Hope this helps.",
        "Leaving this to just before trustee sale date has significantly hurt your chances. Interview several experienced real estate agents immediately to get a realistic assessment of what you can get from the sale of your home. If there is value there, put the house on the market immediately priced to get offers and inform the the lender. As soon as you get an offer ask for an extension on the trustee sale date. They may give you thirty days.",
        "You can sell your home and keep the profit but you are not in a position to get top dollar. You need to finish your sale before the foreclosure. Buyers will know that will make lower offers. Once you receive a bona fide offer the Bank MIGHT give you more time to close escrow. You must act immediately if you want to sell the house and retaing some of your equity."

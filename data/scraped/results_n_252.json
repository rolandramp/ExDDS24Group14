    "title": "Appeal to Ninth Circuit Court from a District Court Bankruptcy Appeal?",
    "question": "Is the Ninth Circuit Court and Ninth Circuit Court BAP the same or separate? If one wishes to appeal a District Court Bankruptcy Appeal (for writ of mandamus authority), can they appeal to the Ninth Circuit Court instead of the Ninth Circuit Court BAP?",
    "answers": [
        "One appeals a bankruptcy order in the 9th Circuit to either the District Court of the district of the bankruptcy court or the BAP. The election is made when the appeal is filed. The decision of the District Court or BAP to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.\nAs stated by other counsel, appellate practice is highly specialized and you would be wise to hire counsel to represent you in an appeal.",
        "Ninth Circuit Bankruptcy Appellate Panel is separate from Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nIf you want to exercise the right to appeal after losing in the District Court, it would be to the 9th Cir Ct of Appeals. (NOT to the BAP.)\n\nIf you're appealing from District Court, it means someone already elected to bypass the BAP.\n\nBAP is only from Bankruptcy Court if someone appeals a Bankr.

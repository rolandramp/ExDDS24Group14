        "If you applied for and opened an account to buy the computer and the Ipad or used an existing Apple Barclay card account, they may well have a security interest in the products purchased. A somewhat more concerning factor is why you say you have to wait 90 days to file. Did you buy the stuff and incur the debt with no intent to repay the creditor when you bought the stuff? If so, that is fraud. Bankruptcy is based on honest debtors who need help getting the help they need. It is not intended to assist people to rip off their creditors, regardless of why you or your kids desperately need their Apple products.",
        "There is no way for us to know. You need to review all the documents that came with the card. It is not unusual for some credit cards (or credit accounts) to include purchase money security interests in good bought with the card or credit, especially when the account is opened as part of the purchase. Whether anyone will take the computer is a different question.",
        "Most likely unsecured. Most people apply for and open unsecured credit cards when they are rebuilding their credit. An unsecured credit card requires the cardholder to deposit money up front in order to use the card. You deposit $500 and your credit limit is $500 for example. The money will serve as the collateral for the purchase. If you do not pay your payment, they will take from the collateral. If you are having a problem with this, and are filing a chapter 7 bankruptcy, I would advise you to seek out the assistance of a bankruptcy attorney to ensure that it is done correctly."

    "title": "Small estate affidavit with no will: my dad passed away, I am not sole heir but other just want me to close accounts.",
    "question": "Downloaded form and guide from CA courts. It says if I'm not sole successor then all successors need to sign. This is difficult, we're spread out geographically. We're not contentious, my siblings just want it done and I was appointed the task. Money in bank act is less than $5k. There is debt to settle, so we're not expecting much if any at all though we're hoping for leftover to help with funeral expenses. We cant afford to hire a lawyer, so help would be great. Questions: 1. Is it ok to declare I'm sole successor when I'm not but I'm 100% sure my siblings will not contest? 2. My dad has credit card debts, will the bank with his checking account settle all debts even those not with their own bank? 3. If money's not enough, can they make me liable for his debt with this affidavit? Thanks!",

        "No. It is not \"OK\" to state you are sole successor when you are not.\nNo.. Bank will not settle all debts with other banks and creditors. This is responsibility of personal representative.\nNo. You are not responsible for decedent's debts unless you had assets distributed to you by estate that should have been used to pay decedent's debts. You should settle decedents debts before distributing to heirs or beneficiaries.\nSmall Estate Affidavit does not protect against creditors' claims. As part of the declaration you agree to indemnify the person or company turning the property over to you from any claims that might arise.",
        "No you can't claim you are the sole successor when you aren't. That would be perjury and misrepresentation on the affidavit. The bank won't settle his debts. If there isn't enough money in his estate to pay his debts, then his estate is insolvent. If that is the case, then just walk away from it. You won't have any liability on his debts if you do nothing. If you do file an affidavit and you then make false statements, and then take the funds, you could be placed in a position of liability. If the estate is insolvent, then sugget the family get together and pool funds for pay for funeral expenses.",
        "Unfortunately you cannot declare under penalty of perjury that you are the sole heir when you are not. You can complete an affidavit for each heir forward to them for their signatures and they can all send theirs back to you so you can file them all. You are not personally liable for any debt and funeral expenses is a priority debt. Use the money for the funeral first and if there is any left over, pay the creditors that pursue it. Good luck."

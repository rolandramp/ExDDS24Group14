    "title": "Can Bankruptcy Court supersede a Superior Court Divorce decision?",
    "question": "Ex husband collected rental income on property awarded to me. He instructed renters not to pay me. He owes me over $35,000 in rental income and now has filed for Bankruptcy. The money was not categorized as spousal support; therefore it's not protected under Bankruptcy law, but the Superior Court issued instructions that he is to pay me because he illegally collected the rents. Can Bankruptcy law supersede a Superior Court decision?",

        "US Trustee has control over all property of the debtor. You should probably file an adversary action in the bankruptcy court, alleging fraud (secuestration of funds that would otherwise be due to you as spousal support or otherwise). That will get the judge's rapt attention.",
        "Yes. Sometimes they can. They haven’t here. You’re golden, based of facts stated.",
        "In answer to your question: yes - Federal bankruptcy law can supersede State court decisions. You see it every day when a state court judgment is discharged when the debtor files BK. In your case, however, IF the property was awarded to you in the Judgment of Dissolution AND your ex intercepted and retained the rent belonging to you, then that is a criminal act and possibly not dischargeable.",
        "Your question has several \"moving parts\" involving a \"cross-over\" between bankruptcy and family law issues. This site lacks the \"back and forth\" you get from a live consultation with a lawyer. One answered question leads to the next, etc, etc. As said by my colleagues, you need to find/consult/hire a lawyer using the Avvo feature \"Find a Lawyer\". Make a list of 4-5 having many 5 star reviews from satisfied clients. If you don't get a prompt call back from one, go on to the next on your list. Some offer a free consultation by phone or in person.\n\nThat said, your best legal theory would be to have your lawyer file a complaint to determine the dischargeability of the $35K debt using one of the so-called \"bankruptcy crimes\" enumerated at 11 USC §523. Irrespective of the lack of any finding in the Family Law court that the unlawful collection of rent by your ex exists, you would still be able to allege and hopefully prove that his violation of the Family court order constitutes an intentional financial harm to you and therefore fits the \"intentional acts\" listed in 11 USC §523. Good luck to you and to your attorney. This is NOT a DIY project.",
        "The best advice given already is to consult with an experience bankruptcy attorney to discuss the actions of your ex-spouse in diverting the payments to himself. You may have the ability to seek a determination from the bankruptcy court that your claim against the ex-spouse (now a debtor in bankruptcy) is a claim that is not dischargeable in his bankruptcy case. It requires filing an adversary proceeding (lawsuit) in his bankruptcy case and there are procedures and deadlines to be aware of. Consult with a bankruptcy attorney as soon as possible in your area. Good luck.",
        "Based on the few facts presented, you may have to determine if there is an exception to dischargeability of the claim (requiring an \"adversary proceeding\" be filed in the bankruptcy claim - like a lawsuit within the bankruptcy case.) Some grounds to dischargeability would be fraud or misrepresentation. Speak to an attorney to determine if your claim fits these definitions and the process for pursuing.",
        "Contact a bankruptcy attorney to see if the debt is non dischargeable under 11 USC 523(15)",
        "You may be able to file an objection to discharge in bankruptcy court on the basis of fraud. You will need an experienced bankruptcy litigator to help you. Good luck.",
        "You have the decision of the Family Court so the issue is now for the Bankruptcy Court, which does have the ability to discharge certain debts documented in a state court order or judgment unless the debt is of certain kinds that are not dischargeable under Bankruptcy law. That is why I have transferred the question to the AVVO Bankruptcy forum. The finding of illegality in the state court could be important.",
        "The reimbursement of rental income isn’t spousal support. Discuss with a bankruptcy attorney."

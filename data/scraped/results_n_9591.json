    "title": "Are out of state wage garnishment judgments with 14.9% interest valid within California via a scavenger debt collector?",
    "question": "A Colorado wage garnishment order from 2006 is now being enforced by a California employer. The amount due has an interest penalty of 14.9%. I thought before garnishments are processed in California, the employee must be notified and given a chance to contest the garnishment. I thought out-of-state judgements had to be refiled in California so that the employee is protected from incorrect claims and from excessive interest penalties and fees associated with wage garnishment judgements. The California employee did not know anything about the garnishment until his paycheck was suddenly reduced by 25%.",

        "An out-of-state judgment doesn't have to be re-filed in another state, it's a \"sister state\" judgment that can be, and obviously in this case was, honored by another state's court, in this case CA.\n\nYou don't state anything about this debt not being valid or the claim being incorrect, and as for the judgment debtor having some rights to fight enforcement, the judgment debtor had the right to fight the claim before it became a judgment. When a judgment creditor executes on a judgment, they don't have to notify the judgment debtor in advance. If they did, you'd move your money to a different bank so they couldn't attach it, or maybe even change jobs to avoid garnishment.\n\nInterest penalties this high are, under the laws benefitting credit card companies, not usuious and legal, if that's what your credit contract said. The contract also presumably allows them to add their legal fees.\n\nIf you think there's something invalid about the judgment or the way the judgment cerditor is enforcing it, you may want to hire a lawyer so you can disclose everything about your caes and so the lawyer can examine the court papers to see if there's some argument you could make to stop or slow this process.\n\nDisclaimer: Please note that this answer does not constitute legal advice, and should not be relied on, since each state has different laws, each situation is fact specific, and it is impossible to evaluate a legal problem without a comprehensive consultation and review of all the facts and documents at issue. This answer does not create an attorney-client relationship.",
        "If Disney has a presence in Colorado then a Colorado judgment may lead to a Colorado garnishment against any Disney employee, whether they are in California or Cameroon. It's one of the perils of being a debtor and working for a major company (or even a minor one with presence in more than one state).\n\nIf you work for the mom 'n pop business in your state, the judgment from another state must be domesticated under the UEFJA before your wages can be garnished locally (if your state even allows garnishment). If you work for a multinational, even if you live in a state with no garnishment and the original judgment was in a state with no garnishment (same state or different state), it can be domesticated under the UEFJA in any state where the employer has a presence, and BINGO! they can garnish from afar."

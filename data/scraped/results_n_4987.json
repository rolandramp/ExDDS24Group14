    "question": "I received a default judgement from a collection agency but their account and the judgement info are not on the credit report i had recently pulled. are they legitimate? does that happen at all? it is in the correct amount and the collection agency did show me a proof of their dept purchased from the original creditor (bank) I had an account under but i'm wondering why they don't show up on the credit report. (or am I lucky for it not showing up?)",

        "A judgment not being on a credit report has no bearing on the validity of the judgment. If there is a signed order by a judge re the default judgment then the judgment is valid. Perhaps the company has not yet reported it to the credit bureau. Perhaps they reported it to a bureau that you have yet to check. Although the judgment has temporarily not affected your credit, you are still liable for the judgment and subject to levies/garnishments/liens unless you file for bankruptcy or come to sort of post-judgment settlement agreement with them.

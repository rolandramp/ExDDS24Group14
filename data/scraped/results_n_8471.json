    "title": "Do you really need to include your secured debt(i.e car payment) under a chapter13 plan to allow 2nd lien strip? Help!",
    "question": "I was told today by an attorney I had consulted in CA that I will be needing to include my car payment of $750 per mos to my chp13 plan in order for a 2nd lien strip to be possible. My car will be paid off in a year and I don't want to start from scratch and pay it in 5yrs again(even if it is lower). Besides, it is more flexible not to include this in the plan. Also, I worry about implication of car title under bankruptcy plan. Pls help clarify BK attorneys..",

        "Only in a Chapter 13 bankruptcy, and not in a chapter 7 bankruptcy, can a second mortgage be removed from your home. This is what’s commonly referred to as “stripping off” the lien.\n\nIn the past few years, strip offs have become much more common as property values in both Colorado and nationwide have substantially decreased.\n\nHow do you strip off a second mortgage? If the fair market value of your home (as of the date of the bankruptcy filing) is less than the overall mortgage balance for the 1st mortgage only, the second mortgage is deemed to be unsecured, thus allowing for such to be stripped off in a Chapter 13 bankruptcy.\n\nFor instance, if the fair market value of your house as of the date of the bankruptcy filing is $200,000, any second mortgage is considered unsecured if you still owe $220,000 on just your 1st mortgage. For many clients, these two numbers will be very close in which case I recommend that either a realtor conduct a Comparative Market Analysis (CMA) or, for situations where this could be a contested issue in Bankruptcy Court, a formal appraisal.\n\nWhat this entails is that, throughout the Chapter 13 payment plan, the amount owed to the second mortgagee will be added to any other unsecured debt (such as credit card debt or medical bills) and only a small portion of this overall unsecured debt is typically paid back to the unsecured creditors, depending on your particular circumstances. At the same time, unlike with any remaining secured creditors, you will not required to pay back the second mortgagee the amount of its claim, and no interest accrues either since the claim is no longer secured.\n\nPlease be aware that the second mortgage cannot be stripped off if even $1 of debt remains secured. Going back to my previous example involving the $200,000 house, no strip off will occur on a second mortgage if the amount owed on the first mortgage (again, as of the date of the bankruptcy filing) is even just below $200,000.\n\nWhen the chapter 13 plan is successfully completed, the Bankruptcy Court will enter a discharge order which will include the portion of unpaid unsecured debt, including the stripped off second mortgage. Once the bankruptcy discharge order is entered, the second mortgage is deemed permanently extinguished.\n\nWith that said, it is critical for the bankruptcy debtor to successfully make all chapter 13 plan payments to complete the plan. Only after this time will the court enter the final discharge order stripping off the second mortgage. I always advise clients of the disastrous impact of an unsuccessful chapter 13 plan: if the case is dismissed (almost always for failure to make plan payments), all unsecured debts, such as the almost stripped off mortgage and credit card debts are retroactively revived, including accrued interest and penalties."

    "question": "My mom died last year, when she did the executor (one of my siblings) came in and changed the locks on mom's house so none of the other children (5 others) could get in. Her and her husband came in and cleaned out mom's house (they said they threw out junk) without telling the rest of us. I have noticed through the course of looking back on pictures that several items are missing (e.g. a picture she said I could have and pottery that I gave to her) do I have any recourse?",

        "Is probate open? What is value of assets in question? Executor does have duty to secure and protect assets of the estate. If probate open, document grievances and be prepared to present them to court in written pleadings. If not, petition court for appointment as executor. Either way, you can obtain redress for your grievances. Consult probate counsel.",
        "If probate is closed, there is nothing you can do. If probate is still opened, then request of the court that executor be restrained from doing what you believe is in contravention of her duties. Unfortunately, however, it appears that executor may be well within their duties to disperse personal property and get rid of junk.. An executor is not required to be polite or ask forgiveness of siblings, or even ask the siblings what they may want of teh unclaimed or un-willed personal property. As long as the executor is performing their fiduciary duties, paying off debts and taxes, and distributing the property pursuant to the will, they are doing their job. Also, generally, the admininistrator of an intestate estate may be given more latitude in decision making than a testate estate where a valid will discusses distribution in more detail to beneficiaries. Good luck. Check with local lawyer.",
        "As stated, it all depends upon whether probate is still open and whether you have proof of the missing items. If they are gone, they are gone. Generally courts cannot do much about personal property without proof it existed at the date of death. If it is all about the personal property, you may have to make peace with it.",
        "If Probate is closed, there is not much you can do. If Probate is open, the next question is, did your mother have a will? If so, did it address the items you mention? If so, you will be able to address the issue in court via the Petition for Distribution. If not, and there is no proof that your mother intended to leave you those items, unfortunately there is not much you can do. Generally, the executor/administrator will allow the family to claim personal items that were not specifically designated to a person in a will before \"cleaning out the house\". If your sister did not follow this courtesy, unfortunately, there really is no recourse at this point. I am sorry.",
        "Is there an open probate? If so, you could bring it up during the petition for final distribution stage. It may be an uphill battle without proof of missing items of value."

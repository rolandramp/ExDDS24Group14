    "title": "Can a chapter 7 bankruptcy be disqualified if I switch jobs with a higher salary?",
    "question": "I am planning on filing Chapter 7 Bankruptcy. I qualify as of right now. What happens if I switch jobs after filing and before the case is closed and debts are dismissed? Does the case have to be amended to show that I am making more money? Does that disqualify my petition for Chapter 7?",
    "answers": [
        "Assuming that you are eligible at the time of filing your Chapter 7 case, a post-petition change in income will not disqualify you under the Means Test, which looks to the income you received during the 6-month term ending on the last day of the month immediately preceding the month in which you file. However, a motion to dismiss may still be brought by the Office of the United States Trustee or by the Court under Section 707(b)(3) up to the \"bar date\", the date fixed as 60 days after the date first set for the Meeting of Creditors, where it would appear that a change in your income would make it an abuse to proceed in Chapter 7. Such motions are discretionary, and frankly rare. When such a motion is filed, the Court is not bound by the rigid expense standards of the Means Test, and may grant or deny the motion based on an examination of the totality of the circumstances.\n\nBear in mind that the fundamental purpose of the Bankruptcy Code is to give the honest but unfortunate debtor an opportunity to obtain a \"fresh start\". It is only those debtors who seek a \"head start\" by avoiding obligations where they have the ability to make a meaningful effort of repayment who need be concerned about dismissal under Section 707(b)."

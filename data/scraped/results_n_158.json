    "title": "Can I remove my wife from all of my bank accounts and credit cards and can there be legal backlash?",
    "question": "I am the sole provider for our household. All of our financial accounts (bank and credit card) were opened in my name and my wife was later added to them. My wife has decided that she doesnâ€™t want to live with me and I need to go live somewhere else. She convinced me that it was for the good of the marriage, she needed healing, I was emotionally abusive blah blah blah. I foolishly agreed wanting to save the marriage only to find that she really has no desire to change anything. She wants me out of the house on a beans and rice budget while she gets the kids and all my paychecks. If I were to remove her name from every bank account and cancel all her credit cards, and only provide her with the money she needs to live, could I be in legal trouble? Will I face legal backlash?",

        "It seems that if you can't pay your car payment then your financial situation should be bad enough to qualify for bankruptcy. While you may not qualify for some reason for a chapter 7 there is also the chapter 13 option. Sometimes when you think there are no options you can be wrong, I would highly recommend that you consult with an attorney so all of your financial situation can be evaluated. Very rarely do I meet with a client that we can not establish a plan that can help their situation.\n\nTake the time to review my website as there is some helpful information there that will assist you in analyzing your situation.\n\nDisclaimer: Attorney's response is not intended as legal advice and is intended for informational purposes only.

        "Assuming that all goes badly for you, that they are fast at their procedures, and they mail you a properly prepared the notice of intention to sell the vehicle, then they sell the vehicle in a commercially reasonable manner, then they file a lawsuit in court, then they serve the lawsuit on your properly, then you fail to answer within the time provided, then they request a default judgment against you and the court grants it, then they find out where you work and get an Earnings Withholding Order and promptly serve your employer, then perhaps as little as six months.\n\nHowever, take note that each of those steps has the risk that it will not be done quickly or properly and that you will have a defense to the lawsuit and perhaps not owe the debt at all or that it may take them years before they get around to filing a lawsuit and getting a judgment and an order to garnish your wages, which is much more typical for an installment contract. My suggestion is stay on top of this, because they make important mistakes and delays. You can follow up with me privately through my Avvo profile. I have been dealing with these cases since 1997."

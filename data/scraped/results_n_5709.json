        "The answer to this question depends on the Judge assigned to your case and the particular district your case was filed in within California. Typically, the motion to to \"strip\" or \"avoid\" the lien on a piece of real property needs to be filed and actually heard before the court assigned to your case before your chapter 13 case can be confirmed.\n\nA few select judges do not require that the motion to avoid lien be filed prior to confirmation but that is usually not the case.",
        "When I file lien strip or cram down motions it depends on my judge trustee assignement and wheter or not the creditor has filed a proof of claim I can then use as evidnece of the indebtedness. The short answer is no the motion does not have to be filed with the plan, however make sure you note in the miscellanious section of the plan that you intend to file the motion. In most cases the motion must be ruled upon and the order entered before confirmation of the plan can occur. Make sure you file the motion with enough time for service.",
        "The procedure may be different in the same courthouse from Judge to Judge (as it is in Georgia). Another issue is that the Trustee, Judge or creditors may object to the plan if disposable income that would otherwise go to your creditors is instead directed to your business or investment property that you don't need. Of course, these areas basically require a lawyer to get through in 99% of cases.",
        "Anytime prior to plan confirmation.",
        "Some judges in Los Angeles allow you to strip a lien by way of a motion, while others require an adversary proceeding. Some judges will confirm a plan where a motion/adversary proceeding to strip a lien is pending, while others require the lien to be stripped before the plan is confirmed.",

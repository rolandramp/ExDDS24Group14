    "title": "Where do I show money from Pell Grant when filing Chapter 7",
    "question": "I am a full time student in California. I received a Pell Grant as my only source of income. Do I report the amount I received from the Pell Grant on Sch I as monthly income even if I only received it each semester (I did the calculation to break it down as a monthly amount)? Do I also report it on the Statement of Financial Affairs #2?",

        "List it under \"other income\" on Schedule I. Average it out to arrive at a monthly amount and use that on the Means Test. BK is not a DIY project. Click the Avvo tab \"Find a Lawyer\". Many offer a free consultation. Good luck to you.",
        "Schedule I for \"other income\". Pell Grants are direct grants in aid for qualifying students who are underprivileged or suffering economic hardship.\n\nBecause this may be considered income, up to $5500 per year nowadays (I believe), they are income.\n\nYou also report it as other income in Q2 of SOFA and must transfer it over to the means test Form B22A.\n\nIf you have no other source of income, then I would not worry too much as you would pass the means test.\n\nIf you have any of that money in a bank account, be sure to spend it down before filing for bankruptcy and report any balance in Schedule B under bank accounts and note that this is Pell Grant money.\n\nBecause Pell Grant money is a form of dependent government financial assistance, it may be exempt from creditors.\n\nClick on \"Find a Lawyer\" above and see if you can locate a bankruptcy lawyer to review your schedules and related papers before filing just to make sure you're compliant and will sail through seamlessly.",
        "If you do not have to pay it back it is income for the means test. If it is in the last 6 months it goes into the B22 Statement of Current Monthly income. I doubt that you are going to fail the means test over a Pell grant so that should not be an issue. As to the I schedule I would not put it in there as it is not regular income though you could note it in the catchall spot at the bottom about annual changes in income. Yes you should note it on the Statement of Financial Affairs #2.\n\nI would suggest that you check with a competent bankruptcy lawyer to go over your whole situation before you consider doing it on your own. I have seen too many disasters over 37 years of doing this because the debtor did financial brain surgery on themselves with horrible results."

        "How much $$$$ are you talking about? The amount will affect what options you may have. In terms of repairing your credit, not going to realistically happen. A paid off judgment still won't disappear from your credit for many years! Hope this perspective helps!",
        "Plenty of attorneys in debt relief area in your area listed in Avvo. Call them.",
        "First, it is extremely difficult to decipher the facts of your case so perhaps you could re-post your question when you can get to a laptop and properly type. With that said, generally speaking, without really knowing the facts of your case, you can not get a judgment set aside unless you have a significant reason to do so such as you were never properly served. Another reason would be that you were not a proper party to the lawsuit if you were truly only an employee of the business. An employee of a business is not responsible for the debts of the business. However, a lot of time has passed and if you knew of the judgment than you would have been required to raise these defenses in a motion to set aside years ago and by not doing so you waive your right to raise these defenses. Lastly, the creditor has to renew the judgment every 10 years to be able to collect on the judgment and keep the judgment \"active\". You would want to find out if it is active."

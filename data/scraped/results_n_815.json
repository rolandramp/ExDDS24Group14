    "title": "Should I pay my student loans after filing Ch. 7??",
    "question": "I recently filed for Ch. 7 on my own. I have one student loan and I understand it will not be discharged. I had a forbearance on it however that time just ended and I have a payment due in a few weeks. Should I pay it while I'm in the process of bankruptcy or wait until I actually receive a discharge on my other debts and complete the bankruptcy process prior to making any student loan payments?",

    "answers": [
        "Once your bankruptcy case is filed, your student loans automatically go into bankruptcy forbearance. Upon Discharge, they will become due again. One way of addressing student loan debt is to prepare for addressing those student loans upon emerging, while your bankruptcy case is pending. I would suggest you consult with a local San Diego Attorney who specializes in both Student Loan Law and Bankruptcy Law.",
        "I concur with the responses from my esteemed colleagues. Pay now. That said, I strongly urge you to contact a BK specialist who works with student loan issues. I recommend D.J. Rausa of San Diego.",
        "With Student Loans being most often non-dischargeable in Chapter 7, maintaining or beginning your regular monthly payments on the student loan should generally not be a problem even though Chapter 7 has not completed. The answer might be different if you had a large amount of money to pay to the student loan and that amount was not disclosed to the trustee and exceeded your allowed exemptions. As that does not apply in your case, you should be OK. To be sure, it is always wise to contact a lawyer in your area and I would encourage you to do so. Good Luck.",
        "Unless you want your student loan to go into default, which could result in a collection fee of upwards of 30% of the unpaid balance, you should begin paying as soon as you are discharged. A student loan lawyer may be able to get you an enormous deal based on either your income or your type of work which makes paying an expert to advise you on these programs a good investment. Hope this perspective helps!"

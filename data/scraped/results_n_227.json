    "title": "Can I still be deposed if the civil case (personal injury) was discharged in a bankruptcy proceeding?",
    "question": "Three years ago I was involved in a car collision. I did not have insurance at the time. A civil lawsuit was filed against me. Because I did not have any assets, the case was dismissed in bankruptcy court. Now the attorneys are sending me subpoenas to appear at depositions.",

        "Your question is confusing. Did you file chapter 13 or 7? Was the bankruptcy \"dismissed\" or did you get a discharge\" These are critical issues to know in order to understand what your position is with regard to this creditor and the subpoena. Talk with a bankruptcy attorney to get this cleared up.",
        "Did your bankruptcy get dismissed or did you get a discharge? Your question is confusing. The answers you have received are conflicting because some attorneys are reading \"dismissed\" as it is used legally:\nyour case was kicked out. In which case the personal injury case would continue against you and you have to appear at the deposition.\nOther attorneys are assuming that you are confusing \"dismissed\" with \"discharged\" and answering the question that if there are other people involved in the personal injury case, you may be a witness, and can be subpoenaed as a witness.\nTake your paperwork to an attorney so the confusion can be cleared up, and you'll know what to do.",
        "Sounds like you’re still embroiled in the fallout from the collision from three years ago. Sounds frustrating.\n\nI’m sure you don’t mean it to be, but your question is confusing. I’ll explain why in a moment, but I suspect that confusion is leading to correct answers from the other attorneys that might seem hard for you to put together. Maybe not. Here goes anyway.\n\nYou said the case was dismissed “because you didn’t have assets.” For future readers, you should know that not having assets isn’t sufficient grounds for a case to be dismissed (e.g., not getting a discharge) without more evidence why you shouldn't be entitled to a discharge. I'd estimate the vast majority of folks who file do so with very few assets and get a fresh start.\n\nBecause of this, something else must have happened three years ago to prevent you from obtaining a discharge. Getting clear on what happened and being certain whether you did or didn’t get a discharge (and why) will be helpful when you talk to a lawyer. It seems hazy from what you described.\n\nAs Attorney Hayes correctly pointed out, there are exceptions to the discharge, even if you did get one. But it seems you didn’t, so I don’t think we need to go into it beyond noting that there are exceptions.\n\nThe other point that isn’t clear to me from the question is about the nature of the lawsuit. Did they name you as a party or not? If you were just a participant in the accident (not being named in the lawsuit), and they simply want to take your deposition then it wouldn’t matter if you had a discharge or not. You’d still have to appear as Attorney Heston pointed out (and others as well).\n\nAnyway, thought this response might tie together some of the other attorneys’ responses and explain why it’s a little hard to figure out what’s going on based on your question.\n\nGood luck—and absolutely get a lawyer to help you with this one because there may still be some options, but it’s going to take a detailed conversation with a lawyer!!",
        "Sometimes the plaintiffs are trying to get paid from their own Uninsured Motorist Insurance coverage so they still need your sworn statement. If the matter was discharged in BK and was listed in the petition then you are not likely to be liable. However you can still be sanctioned by a state court for contempt if you fail to obey a subpoena. Just respectfully show up on time with your bankruptcy discharge order (bring several copies). Answer the questions honestly and truthfully.",
        "Assuming that you received a discharge in the bankruptcy, including the civil damage claim, you can only be deposed as a witness.\n\nResponding to subpoenas is a civic duty, sort of like serving on a jury. But if you have discharged the claim and therefore are not a party to a lawsuit, you can only be subpoenaed to give testimony in the case against any remaining defendants. If there were no other defendants in the lawsuit, the deposition serves no purpose. If there were other defendants, the plaintiff is entitled to obtain your testimony.\n\nYou are also entitled to be compensated as a non-party witness and you should demand advance payment of the statutory witness fee and reimbursement of your travel expenses. Also, there are limitations on the distance that you can be required to travel and the length of time that the deposition can continue.\n\nYou may want to consult a state law attorney regarding your right to be compensated and the limitations designed to protect you.",

        "You are missing a few facts, like what was the disposition of the BK. If you were discharged, then you will not be liable for pre-BK debts, with some exceptions. But you can still be a witness on someone else's case. Was the civil case dismissed? The bankruptcy case?",
        "Yes. If BK was dismissed without discharge, you may be sued for pre-BK debts.",
        "If your bankruptcy documents listed creditors and potential creditors properly, you completed the bankruptcy, and you obtained a discharge of your debts, you might not be liable. If alcohol was involved, there may be an exception. The subpoenas may relate to other parties involved in the accident, and they have the right to depose you as a witness. You should take the subpoenas, your bankruptcy documents, and your information regarding the accident to an attorney to review the details. This website is not intended to answer specific, current legal questions that involve complicated facts and prior legal proceedings. Details and review are needed to provide a meaningful opinion.

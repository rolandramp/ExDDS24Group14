        "If you are in a chapter 7, the filing fee is $338, the credit report will cast approximately $50, and the lawyer will charge anywhere between $1200 and $3,000 depending on the lawyer. Don't base your decisio9n to higher a lawyer just on price. Most lawyers offer free initial consults. You can find them on AVVO. Talk to two or three and find one with whom you are comfortable. Most will take payment plans."

    "question": "I earned more than expected from my job. Now social security is coming after me for $10k overpayment. Can I discharge this?",
    "answers": [
        "This very situation has come up several times in the past with past clients. The answer to this is more complicated than a simple yes or no. I agree with the other attorney who states that if you are entitled to future benefits Social Security will not pay out benefits until the overpayment is repaid. So if that happens, then the debt is not really discharged, it is offset. In a Chapter 7, monies owed to the government, which Social Security is, cannot be discharged unless over 3 years. While you will not have to actually re pay the overpayment, you just wont' get pay outs until you are caught up.",
        "I agree with the other attorneys. SS debts can be discharged assuming no fraud or misrepresentation. Once you file the automatic stay takes effect SS should stop collections. However after the discharge order is entered SS can deduct your ongoing benefits under \"recoupment\". I highly recommend you talk to a bankruptcy attorney give him all the facts and determine what your best options are.",
        "I concur with colleagues.\nYes. SS overpayment dischargeable in BK.\nYes. SS may offset overpayment against future benefits.",
        "The other two attorneys are both correct, you can discharge social security overpays so long as the overpayments were not obtained through fraud or misrepresentation (which is very rare). Thus you can discharge your debts in these areas without trouble.",
        "I concur with my colleague atty Rausa. BK is not a DIY project. Click the Avvo tab \"Find a Lawyer\". Some of us even offer a free consultation by phone or in person.",
        "The short answer is yes. This is a dischargeable debt. However, if you become entitled to Social Security Benefits in the future, that benefit can be offset by the amount owed. For instance, if you become entitled to a $1,000.00 per month benefit, the Social Security Department can hold back 10 months worth of benefits.\n\nGood Luck"

        "Yes -- accountants are asked to determine different things. The cost will depend on what they are asked to do. For example, tracing of financial transactions is very different from determining the marital standard of living.",

        "Any family law attorney can answer your questions in a short consultation. Attorneys research and retain investigators to produce comprehensive accountings. Although a well directed investigation can result in disclosure without spending a lot of money, often it's not necessary to make one.",
        "Let’s clarify a few things as we go along. Accountants do not do investigations, private investigators do. Private investigators do have different levels of financial investigation, usually divided int geographical areas, but what can be obtained has been severely limited port 9/11. You can also obtain financial information from the other spouse, simply by asking (informally or by using discovery). Once you have enough financial information to hire an accountant, you need to know what the focus is, marital estate valuation, business valuation, income available for support, marital standard of living, etc. The more detailed and precise you want the work of the CPA, the higher the cost. Both private investigators and accountants may be called as expert witnesses, but the accountant’s are typically the only ones called to testify."

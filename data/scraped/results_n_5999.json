        "I agree with my colleagues; you may do both. And as Mr. Lysle stated, if he files a claim of exemption, you may oppose it and set the matter for court hearing. The judge will then decide how much is levied/garnished.\n\nThe Rutter Group's \"Enforcing Judgments and Debts\" is an excellent resource for determng the procedures to collect your judgment. You can find this practice guide in your local public law library.\n\nOf course, you can also consult with a collections attorney who practices in the county in which the judgment was entered.\n\nGood luck.",
        "Yes - you can do both."

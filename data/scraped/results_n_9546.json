    "title": "Can I sue my ex-boyfriend for credit debt even though he was only an authorized user?",
    "question": "I added my ex as an authorized user to my credit card. Currently I have $9000 credit debt (both mine and his). The bank said he is not legally responsible for any of the charges because he was an authorized user and not a co-holder. Can I sue him for his portion?",

        "You can sue him for charges that you can prove were his in small claims court. The problem I predict you'll have is that you authorized him to use the card. You do not say you had any agreement with him that he pay his own charges. But small claims court is cheap and quick and you just might luck out.",
        "Assuming that you have credible evidence as to which debts are his and which are yours, you can bring an action against him in small-claims court - please see the link below.\n\nDisclaimer: This post does not constitute legal advice and does not establish an attorney-client relationship.",
        "The bank is correct that \"authorized users\" are not legally responsible. I am in fact surprised to hear them admit that as they sometimes try to illegally collect such debts.\n\nIt is idifficult to fully answer your question on so few facts. However, if you had an agreement with your ex-boyfriend about his responsibility for his portion of the debt, you may have a claim against him for breach of contract, or if the facts warrant, fraud. But a claim in fraud is difficult to prove. The strength of your case is extremely fact sensitive. A consultation with local ocunsel is likely warranted. Best of luck.\n\nThis information is not, nor is it intended to be, legal advice. This does not constitute the formation of an attorney-client relationship.

        "If they have a judgment, they can enforce it by levying your bank account; garnishing your wages to the extent it exceeds the federal minimum wage rate on a 30 hour work week (see my Avvo legal guide on wage garnishment for more details); record a lien in any and every county in the State; require you to appear for a judgment debtor's examination and bring your tax, banking, and financial records to court with you; ask the judge for an order to seize certain personal property of yours, if not exempt; and subpoena records and testimony to try to locate other assets and sources of income. The fact that you are self employed means that they may tap the income receipts from your sources of income, until the judgment is satisfied.",
        "A levy for starters. If they can locate your bank account (history of writing this creditor checks or letting them debit makes it really easy), creditors can take any money up to the amount owed.

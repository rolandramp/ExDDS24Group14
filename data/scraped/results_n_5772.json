        "Are you looking to transfer your property in order to evade payment of a judgment? That could be a \"fraudulent conveyance\" and result in tripling the amount of the judgment / order, setting aside the transfer and bringing the transferee into your litigation. You can consult with a lawyer now, and pay a modest fee for legal services, or you can wait, try to do the transfer yourself, and incur really huge attorney's fees.\n\nThe time frame for placing a lien is quite short. It takes considerably longer to effect a sale of real property. If the real property is a primary residence, an appraisal must be conducted, a court hearing held, and the creditor must pay, up front, the amount of the homestead exemption.",
        "There would have to be a judgment first. But a judgment can later be amended to include attorney's fees and/or costs.\n\nWith a superior court judgment, there is no stay of enforcement of a judgment (unlike a small claims court judgment which has a 30 day stay). The judgment is immediately enforceable, even with an appeal pending (unless there is a court ordered stay or appeal bond in place).\n\nThe timing is largely going to depend upon the judgment creditor. The judgment creditor can enforce in piecemeal fashion, and does not have to line up all the ducks in a row. In other words, the judgment creditor can immediately record Abstracts of Judgment and/or levy on bank accounts and/or garnish wages, and then apply for a sheriff's sale off either real or personal property.\n\nA judgment creditor does NOT have to try to collect cash first before going after other assets."

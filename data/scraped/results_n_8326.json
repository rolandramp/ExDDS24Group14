        "Mr. Fink's answer is correct: No estate, then no payments to creditors. I would add, however,that it is not to your advantage to give your name, phone number, or address to any of your mother's creditors, because the collection agencies will hound you just as if you were the debtor.",
        "You do not have to write a letter. Just return bills unopened with the word \"deceased\" written on the envelope. Only her estate is responsible for payment of bills.

        "I agree with the prior two answers subject to only one caveat. Assuming the credit cards were not issued in your name and that you did not sign any documents making you liable for her medical bills (such as signing the admission papers to get her into the hospital) then you have no personal liabliity for your mother's debts, and only the assets of her estate are liable for those. So, no assets, no estate, no resources from which to pay the debts.\n\nOne more caution, if your mother transferred her assets to you or other persons with the result that she was insolvent and thus unable to pay her debts and died in that condition, this might constitute a \"fraud in transfer of creditors' thus making the recipients of those assets liable for the debts to the extend of the value of assets received. But unless the amount of debt is significant, collection activity of this sort is unlikely due to its potential cost for the creditor versus the very low likelihood of collecting."

    "question": "Hello. I was wondering; I am a married women, who has been on disability since April 1st right after I lost my job. I am about $100,000 in debt including student loans. I am the co-signer on our second car, but have no rights to the other car. The car I’m a co-signer on is (20,000) in the hole in negative equity. I only have 1 loan. My husband does not want to file bankruptcy and I feel I need too. I can no longer keep up with my bills and the car payment I’m a co-signer on. My question is Can I file bankruptcy separately from him or does it have to be joint? I just need some relief from stress. Thank you for any advice you can provide me.",

        "Yes it is quite possible to file chapter 7 bankruptcy without your spouse filing (he would be a \"non-filing spouse\", and his income still must be considered and included in your case.\n\nAll other answers you have received are quite correct except for one detail: community property law would (also) protect your non-filing spouse from the reach of creditors both during and after your bankruptcy, so long as you remain married. However, any of your non-filing spouse' \"separate property\" (this is a legal question, not merely \"this is his thing and that is my thing\") would be exposed to creditors. It is important to note that your income and your spouse's income has been determined to be a community property asset, as well as any bank account where those funds are deposited regardless of whose name is titled on the account.\n\nBottom line: filing for bankruptcy protection and relief is not a simple task under most scenarios, and it gets even trickier when doing so for one spouse and not the other in a community property state such as California. You would be wise to seek the help and support of an experienced bankruptcy lawyer when evaluating your options with and eligibility for chapter 7 bankruptcy and with preparing to file your case.\n\nBest of luck",
        "Yes, in theory, you can file without your husband.\nBest of luck.",
        "There is a lot involved in answering your question, and you should, of course, meet with a local attorney to get ALL the facts; but, yes, you can file by yourself. Just a few things that need to be considered:\n(1) only YOU will be discharged of your obligations to pay all the dischargeable debts, including auto loans ... anything your husband is responsible for, he will still be responsible for. If he were to file jointly with you, he too could be discharged of the 20,000 negative equity in the car and open up the option of redeeming it for its fair market value..\n(2) his income still needs to be considered when analyzing your finances to determine if you qualify for Chapter 7.\n(3) if the \"other car\" was acquired during your marriage, it is community property (absent a pre-nup) and must be listed as an asset (although it will likely be exempt).\nIn conclusion, it would probably be best to file jointly ... but it's not necessary.",
        "Yes, you can file separately, but the income earned by your husband and the expenses that he will continue to pay must be considered when determining if you qualify for a chapter 7 and how much you must pay in a chapter 13 case. Also, you will be entitled to a discharge of most debt, except for most taxes, child support you owe and most student loans, but you husband will still owe all of the joint debt with you.\n\nAs for the student loans, you may be able to obtain an administrative discharge of your federal student loans because you are now disabled. Check out this website:\nhttps://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/repay-loans/forgiveness-cancellation/disability-discharge\n\nWith respect to discharging student loans in bankruptcy, obtaining a discharge of student loans is very difficult. Because the federal student loans offer people the opportunity to participate in the income based repayment (IBR) plan and there is an opportunity to obtain an administrative discharge under some specific circumstances, discharging federal student loans in a bankruptcy is almost impossible. If a person’s income is low enough, the IBR payment can be reduced to $0.00 per month.\n\nDischarging at least a portion of the outstanding debt owed on private student loans can be done in some cases. First a law suit, called an adversary proceeding must be filed alleging that the student loan debt is dischargeable because payment of the loan will cause an undue hardship on the debtor and his/her dependents. Some courts use a test called the “totality of circumstances” in making the ruling on dischargeability. However, most of the bankruptcy courts around the country follow something called the “Brunner Test” to determine if a student loan can be discharged. The “Brunner Test” must be used in all of the Fifth Circuit states, which is where I practice. If your court follows the Brunner Test, then in layman’s terms you will be require to prove:\n\n1) That you cannot afford to pay the loan payments when your normal monthly income and living expenses are considered.\n\n2) That for the foreseeable future, your financial picture will continue to cause you to be unable to afford the payment for a significant portion of the student loan repayment period.\n\n3) That you have made a good faith effort to repay the loan or loans.\n\nFactors two and three are the issues we have proving so that my clients are entitled to discharge all or part of the student loans. First, the loan needs to be in payment status for a significant period of time and you need to be able to prove that you made payments when you could afford to pay them. I have seen cases in which the judge ruled that the debtor did not show a good faith effort to pay because the Debtor went by Starbucks every morning. The lenders and/or collection agencies will tell you that if you can’t pay the full payment, then do not send anything at all and the lenders’ attorneys will use the fact that you paid nothing against you.\n\nYou need to contact an experienced bankruptcy lawyer in your area that handles a significant amount of litigation in his/her bankruptcy case and ask him to review your situation with what must be proved to discharge a student loan. Many attorneys will give you a free consultation to help you make the decision on what is best for you. You can use the Avvo \"Find a Lawyer\" link above to search for an attorney in your area.",

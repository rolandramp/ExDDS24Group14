    "question": "decsiions before or after the stroke. What we have now is debts and a very sick person who may or may not recover. What is the best way to protect her small assets? We may need it for final expenses...how do we settle her debts? A nursing home may be needed-she has insurance.",

        "In order to qualify for either residential care Medi-Cal or in home supportive services IHSS your mother can only have $2000 in non-exempt assets. For in facility care purposes, this year (2012) California allows transfers of less than $7,092 to be made without causing a penalty period during which a Senior would not be able to receive Medi-Cal (with some exceptions). These gifts can actually be made to the same person each banking day (gift is not completed until it clears). If your mother were to gift $6900 to you and the balance to someone else she could qualify for either program. IHSS does not penalize transfers but it is foolish to qualify for that alone when a higher level of care may eventually be needed.\n\nIf your Mother is competent, explain this to her, perhaps she can be moved to act or sign an enhanced power of attorney that allows you to do this for her. If she is not competent, and has a power of attorney in place, it may be possible to use that power of attorney to make the gifts.If she is incompetent and there is no power of attorney -- the I'm afraid the other responding attorneys are correct and only a court action will allow these transfers.

        "Having a stroke does not necessarily mean that your mother is incapacitated in regards to estate planning. You may want to have her execute a power of attorney to sell the stock. The stock, is probable NOT an exempt asset, so if she fails to sell the stock it would have to be used for her care. If it is determined that your mother is incapacitated and to be able to make decisions on behalf of your mother, if she did not have powers of attorney in place, would be to file for conservatorship. Additionally, you should plan on applying for Medi-Cal to cover her medical costs.",

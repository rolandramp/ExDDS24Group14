    "title": "Quitclaim deed signed in 2015 but not recorded. Can we file now to avoid the home being used to pay medical debts?",
    "question": "My mother in law may only have days to live. Both mother and father in law and my wife signed and notarized a quitclaim deed in 2015. I do not believe it was registered with the country. With her being hospitalized, surgeries, ambulance and helicopter transport, we are assuming the bill to be much larger than we can afford. Could we file the quitclaim deed and avoid my father in laws house being used to pay for a portion of the bills? He has more equity in the home than would be exempt in bankruptcy. And he would not be able to afford paying for that portion. We don't want him to lose his home after loosing his wife.",

        "Do you understand that the county property taxes may be reassessed. There may also be a gift tax payable to the IRS. You should have an attorney review the specifics of your situation. If there is an exemption, get some professional help in completing the exemption forms. As far as medical bills, if Medi-Cal paid them, Medi-Cal can look back 3 years and go after the assets. Check with an elder law attorney. There are ways to avoid the Medi-Cal liens.",
        "You can try, but they may still trace the property to pursue the debt.",
        "Why do you think you will be responsible for your mother-in-law's medical bills? If I understand your question: Your father-in-law lives in a home he quitclaimed to you in 2015. Right? Why did he quitclaim the property to you? To avoid having to show he has any assets? If so, why was it not recorded n 2015? That makes it look suspicious and could be considered a fraudulent conveyance. Did you pay anything to receive the deed? Best advice is for you to set up a consultation with an attorney using the Avvo tab \"Find a Lawyer\". Some offer a free consultation."

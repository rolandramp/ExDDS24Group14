    "question": "i have a earning withholding order for ($1600 ) , i called the attorney which is a debt collector who filed it and talk to him if i can do a monthly plan instead of a wage garnishment, ewo looks so bad on my job. so i would rather have them take out the money from my bank account. is there any way i can do that? and i cant afford them to take out 25% of my pay check. on top of that i dont have 1600 to pay them up front to stop it.",

        "You can file a Claim of Exemption, asking that the amount of the garnishment be reduced in order to allow you enough income to pay for \"necessities of life\" for you and your family. There are two forms to prepare. You file them with the Sheriff. No filing fee.\n\nThe other issue is, How was the judgment entered? Did you go to court? Did you have a trial in front of a judge? Did the plaintiff produce one or more witnesses and competently authenticate the documents? If you did not go to court, why not? If the judgment is not valid, you need to see a lawyer and have the relevant documents reviewed.",
        "The simple answer is, no. File a claim of exemption with the sheriff immediately and see if the Court can help you.\n\nNow is a very bad time to try to work out a settlement. The creditor already has gone through the trouble of obtaining a judgment against you and having a writ of execution issued and served. There is little incentive to settle now unless you can provide something. First, money talks. If you can somehow come up with a credible lump sum, the creditor might listen. You can discount the $1600 somewhat, but keep in mind that all of the hurdles have been overcome and the creditor now has you on the hook. Barring you quitting your job or filing a bankruptcy (neither recommended), there is small incentive for the creditor compromise. The claim of exemption might incentivize the creditor to entertain a reasonable offer. File the claim of exemption and call the creditor shortly afterwards and see what you can work out."

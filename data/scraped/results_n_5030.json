        "i agree with all of the attorneys cogent answers. With that said, I think you should know that after the date of your separation, all property and debts acquired/incurred thereafter are the separate property and obligations of the respective parties. That includes income and retirement contributions. Also, if one party remains in the family residence for their exclusive use, the other party has a credit to the extent of the fair rental value of the property, and if one party post-separation pays down the principal on the mortgage from post-separation earnings, then that party has a claim to the extent of a separate property interest in the community asset.\nYou do not need an interim agreement post-separation to necessarily address these issues pending the resolution of a divorce proceeding.\nNeedless to say, these issues are complicated and this information is for informational purposes only, and is not intended as legal advice upon which you should rely or as a basis for the formation of an attorney-client relationship. Good luck.",
        "You could enter an agreement after marriage and before a divorce proceeding is filed, as you said, a post-nuptial agreement. However, this a developing area of the law, and you and your spouse should proceed carefully to maximize the chances for its enforceability, and should take steps such as, each of you having counsel, making a full disclosure of material information about your assets, debts, and all other claims and rights which are being negotiated, having consideration or an exchange of value if there are any rights or claims waived, and provide each other sufficient time to review the agreement.

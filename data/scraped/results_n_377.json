    "title": "Can I negotiate my property with a bankruptcy trustee?",
    "question": "I have too much equity in my property to file chapter 7 to save my property, even when applying all options including the homestead exemption. It turns out I would have approximately $39,000 of equity left over. My question is, can I negotiate to pay the trustee the $39,000 with a payment plan to save my property to avoid a forced sale? what are the payment terms and interest? and is a trustee required to accept my $39,000 offer before I file? and also, is a trustee normally willing to negotiate a lower amount than $39,000? If so, what percentage of a discount would be reasonable for the trustee to accept? Thank you",

        "You cannot negotiate anything with a Chapter 7 trustee before you file as you do not now which one will be assigned your case. You assume that the trustee will accept your numbers, and he or she may not. You are also assuming that the assigned trustee will give you a break or negotiate with you. I would not make any such assumptions. Remember, a Chapter 7 Trustee has an obligation to your creditors, not to you.\nOn that line of thought, there is no way any attorney can predict what a chapter 7 trustee will do or how he or she will treat your property with the facts that you have stated. Be smart about this as you cannot dismiss a chapter 7 after it has been filed. You can only convert the case to a Chapter 13. So you may want to seriously consider filing a Chapter 13, and I strongly recommend you hire an attorney to ensure your home is not sold from underneath you.",

        "It's much safer to start with a chapter 13 case. There's no reason to wait because the date of filing date freezes the value of the property for the life of the plan. With values going up in Los Angeles area and throughout California, why not lock in today's value and pay it off over five years? If everything crashes in a couple of years and the value comes down, you could consider converting to 7 or deal with it otherwise.

        "In calculating your equity, did you take into account the cost of sale of the property? As a rule of thumb, take 7% off the expected sale price, subtract away the mortgage balance and your exemption to get the expected pay payout to the trustee. Most trustees don't want to sell a debtor's house and will work with you to negotiate a lower amount, but they typically want that amount in three months or less. If that won't work, a chapter 13 might. Please see a bankruptcy attorney to help you with this. In the long un, you will probably get a better deal with a lot less stress.",
        "You can attempt to negotiate a payment plan with the trustee, but typically a Ch 7 trustee will want the negotiated payments to be made over a few months (which may not be feasible for you).

If you do decide to file a bankruptcy case, you really should retain an attorney to assist you since you are dealing with some equity in your home."

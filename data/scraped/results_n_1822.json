        "Yes, an individual plaintiff can certainly sue an individual defendant under Business and Professions Code section 17200 et seq. The individuals do not necessarily need to be a business entity. What is important is whether the defendant engaged in “unlawful,” “unfair,”or “fraudulent” acts. Yes, a 17200 cause of action can be based on fraud or conversion. Business & Professions Code §17200, what is commonly referred to as the Unfair Competition Law (“UCL”) “prohibits any unlawful, unfair or fraudulent business act or practice and unfair, deceptive, untrue or misleading advertising. By proscribing “any unlawful business practice,” §17200 “borrows” violations of other laws and treats them as unlawful practices that the unfair competition law makes independently actionable. To state a claim under §17200, plaintiff must at a minimum properly allege an act or practice, committed pursuant to business activity, that is at the same time forbidden by law or tethered to some express public policy. (Hale v. Sharp Healthcare (2010) 183 Cal.App.4th 1373, 1382-1383. ) Because Section 17200 is written in the disjunctive, it establishes three varieties of unfair competition-acts or practices which are unlawful, or unfair, or fraudulent. In other words, a practice is prohibited as “unfair” or “deceptive” even if not “unlawful” and vice versa.” (Puentes v. Wells Fargo Home Mortg., Inc. (2008) 160 Cal.App.4th 638, 643-644.) Virtually any law (federal, state or local) can serve as a predicate for an action under section 17200. (Hale v. Sharp Healthcare (2010) 183 Cal.App.4th 1373, 1382-1383.)\n\nYes, it is possible for the court to sustain a demurrer to a 17200 cause of action without leave to amend. However, a demurrer tests only the sufficiency of the pleading and whether the cause of action is stated properly. The grounds for a demurrer must appear on the face of the pleading or from judicially noticeable matters. (Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 430.30, subd. (a); Blank v. Kirwan (1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318.). Whether or not a demurrer to your specific 17200 cause of action will require a full review of the entire complaint.",

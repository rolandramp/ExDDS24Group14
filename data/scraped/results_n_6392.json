    "title": "How do I refute a wage garnishment from a judgement against me?",
    "question": "I was just served with papers to garnish my wages for a vehicle I had in 2006. I stopped paying at that time and I'm now being sued. I was told a Substitute Service was mailed in late 2006 however, I never received anything. I'm unable to pay and have no clue how to proceed or fight this.",

        "You need to go to the courthouse where the judgment was entered. Inspect the court's file. Get a copy of the relevant documents, including the Proof of Service. Then, consult an attorney. If the facts warrant, file a motion to vacate the judgment. If the court allows you to respond to the lawsuit, you will be in a good bargaining position and the creditor will have difficulty getting the evidence that it will need to prove its case.",
        "You can file a Claim of Exemption along with a Financial Statement. A Claim of Exemption is a form a debtor files with the levying officer (like the sheriff) explaining why the wages that the creditor wants the debtor’s employer to garnish should be exempt (excluded).\n\nThe forms are:\n\nhttp://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/wg006.pdf\n\nhttp://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/wg007.pdf\n\nTurn in 2 copies of the Claim of Exemption (Form WG-006) and the Financial Statement (Form WG-007) to the levying officer in your case (like the sheriff) within 10 days of receiving the Notice of Levy. Keep one copy of both forms for yourself.\n\nYour employer will hold on to the money garnished until 10 days go by and the creditor hasn’t opposed the claim of exemption, or the judge makes a decision at the hearing on the claim of exemption. If the creditor doesn’t oppose your claim of exemption, your employer will return the wages to you. If the creditor opposes your claim of exemption, you will receive a Notice of Opposition to Claim of Exemption and Notice of Hearing on Claim of Exemption that will set a court date for a judge to make a decision. If the judge agrees with your claim of exemption, you will get the money back. If the judge agrees with the creditor, your employer will send the money to the creditor every month.\n\nFor a list of current exemptions in California, see:\n\nhttp://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/ej155.pdf",
        "You need to file a Claim of Exemption and a Financial Statement. Forms and instructions should have been delivered to you with the notice of garnishment. You should consult and attorney or legal aid if you cannot figure out how to complete the forms yourself.",
        "If you want to fight the judgment itself, you typically need two things, a failure of the plaintiff to serve you (which is possible) and a reason you don't owe the money (you very likely do). So I don't know what success you'd have challenging the judgment.\n\nThe other option is bankruptcy, if that makes sense for you. Otherwise, I am not sure what you could do.",
        "I agree with the prior responses. Another route is to file a Chapter 7 bankruptcy. When you file the bankruptcy the garnishment will stop immediately and you can discharge the entire debt in bankruptcy.\n\nJohn Burt\n949-705-6612\njohn@inhouseattorneys.com"

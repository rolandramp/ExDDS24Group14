        "I agree with Attorney Bayer. Usually this whole situation is avoided by you continuing to make voluntary payments to Nissan (not automatic payments - since they normally stop the automatic payments when a borrower files for BK). Now, yes, they do have the right to repossess the vehicle. A charge off, just means Nissan charged the debt off, however, you still owe the debt, so it being \"charged off\" does not really effect you in any manner.\nYou can usually ask them if you can bring the account current and they will likely accept to avoid the hassle that accompanies repossession.\nYou could offer to buy out the contract, but, yes, your co-signer would need to sign paperwork authorizing you to do that.\nYour deficiency balance would be the difference between the balance on your lease and the amount Nissan is able to sell the vehicle at auction for (which is usually not much) so the balance ends up being larger than one would think.",
        "Nissan did have that right, because the filing of the bankruptcy was a breach of contract between you and them. They bargained for you to have a cosigner, and when your co filed bk, it took that protection away from them.\n\nHowever, everything would probably have been ok provided you continued to make voluntary payments. Nissan and most financial institutions will stop taking automatic payments as soon as someone on the account files bk. However, they will gladly accept voluntary, nonautomatic payments. Why it was that you never noticed that the autopay had stopped is not Nissan's problem.\n\nYou can call and offer them to immediately bring the account current if they will let you resume a normal relationship. I think they will be happy with that. Or, if you want to buy out the contract and own the car, I'm sure they will let you do that. However, you former co will need to sign paperwork with them agreeing to let you have the car solely in your name.\n\nIf you let the car get repoed, you won't know the payoff deficiency until after the car has been sold at auction. Deficiencies are usually quite large because auction sales on repos do not usually bring in much money.\n\nIn a perfect world, your co would have had an experienced bk lawyer who would have told your co to alert you to expect everything that has already happened so you could have prevented it.",
        "A review of the entire lease agreement would be necessary. In a nutshell it depends on whether the terms of the agreement allow it. FYI a charge off is an internal accounting term and has nothing to do with whether you owe the debt."

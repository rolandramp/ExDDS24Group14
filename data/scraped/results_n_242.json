    "question": "My bf was in an accident years ago (DUI) and it killed a man. He was sued by the family and has a judgement of $9,000,000 Would a pre-nup protect me if we were to marry? Is there any way they could \"come after\" my wages or assets in the future?",
    "answers": [
        "A pre-nup would definitely help. Technically, because he acquired this debt before you were married and living together, it is not community property. It also may be what is called a \"non-dischargeable debt,\" or a debt that potentially lasts forever, if he was drunk, or otherwise showed \"moral turpitude\" in causing the accident. Plaintiff has to renew a judgment every 10 years, or it will become unenforceable.\n\nThat said, how would you live if the plaintiff took every last dime your husband earns? You definitely need a prenup to protect your future earnings, and make very clear that this debt is his, and your current and future property belong to you.\n\nGood luck.",
        "1. Definitely, have prenup prepared.\n2. Earnings of married persons, no liable for premarital debts. if earning are paid, those earning remain not liable so long as they are held in a deposit account in nonliable person separate account in which liable spouse has no right to withdrawal, and funds are not commingled with other property of community estate.",
        "A pre-nuptial agreement should be able to protect you. You need to consult with a very experienced family law lawyer. They have the most experience in these matters.",
        "The only way they can \"come after\" your wages or assets is if those wages and/or assets are community property. Assets acquired during the marriage are presumed to be community property (absent a pre-nup) and income based on the time, skill, effort of either spouse is considered community income (absent a pre-nup). A pre-nup would protect your wages and any assets acquired with those wages,",
        "This is not an insurance issue, which is where you posted the question. Unfortunately for your boyfriend he would not be able to discharge the $9 million judgment against him by filing for bankruptcy as the bankruptcy laws specifically deny debtors the right to discharge nearly all civil judgments resulting from a DUI. (However, he should get specific advice on that, and on any and all of his potential alternatives, from a bankruptcy attorney.)\n\nAs you live in California, which is a community property state, your earnings might well be considered community property were you to be married. Even if you had a pre-nup and even if that would operate to legally protect your earnings (and you should consult with a family law attorney on that), the holder of the judgement is likely to keep on poking around looking for assets that could be said to belong to your boyfriend were he to become your spouse, and that would require you to continually be on guard."

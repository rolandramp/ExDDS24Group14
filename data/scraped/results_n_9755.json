        "This is a very simplified version and is not necessarily applicable to your situation, given that I don't know all of the details. So, generally speaking, think of the community as a big bucket. Before you are married, you each have your own buckets. In these buckets are all of your worldly possession and obligations. When you get married, most everything goes into the married bucket (income, property, debts). There are some exceptions: inheritance and gifts being a couple. When the marriage comes to an end, everything in the marriage bucket gets divided; generally it's a 50/50 split. But, of course, there are exceptions, which include co-mingling (where some of the stuff from the pre-marriage buckets got mixed into the marriage bucket). When that happens, it is best to have a financial expert review the information.\n\nYou really should have an attorney take a look at your individual situation so that s/he can best guide you. Fierce battles are fought over these types of issues. But you do have options. If you want to save as much of the assets from both your pre-marriage and marriage buckets, I would recommend that you consider mediation or collaboration. They tend to offer far more satisfying results and keep more money in your pockets than litigation. Feel free to visit my web site for more information at www.wcmediate.com.",

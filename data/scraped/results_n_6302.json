    "title": "WHAT IS THE BEST PROCEDURE TO FIGHT A HOA WHO IMPROPERLY FORECLOSED BASED ON DISCHARGED DEBT?",
    "question": "In California, HOA dues are an unsecured debt until the association records a Notice of Delinquent Assessment. Recording the notice in the land records creates a secured lien in the property. Further, CCP §493.030(b) states: “The filing of a petition commencing a voluntary or involuntary case under Title 11 of the United States Code (Bankruptcy)terminates a lien of a temporary protective order or of attachment if the lien was created within 90 days prior to the filing of the petition.”",
    "answers": [
        "Without specifically addressing CA law - Generally, secured debt remains attached to the property and the property can be repossessed by the creditor after the case is closed without violating the injunction.\n\nI hope this helps.\nRespectfully,\nSteven A. Leahy\nwww.chicagotaxteam.com",
        "I note this question is very similar to another asked today. However, the facts differ in one important respect. In the earlier question, the Asker stated that the lien was filed AFTER the petition was filed but 90 days prior to discharge. This set of facts has the lien being filed within 90 days prior to the filing of the petition.\n\nI hope you can appreciate unwillingness to answer questions here where critical facts are in dispute.\n\nIn my non-legal opinion, the first Asker had a more favorable set of facts. I do not believe the California code section you cited applies – it does not appear to apply by its terms. Perhaps the debtor could have moved in the BK court to avoid the lien. I assume the debtor did not.\n\nI do not see a violation of a discharge injunction as the lien was filed before the petition. Post petition dues and assessments are also due. The discharge only prevents a suit against the debtor, personally, for dues incurred prior to filing. It does not prevent foreclosure of the security interest in the property for non-payment.\n\nSince you are the attorney the decision regarding the proper procedure to follow, under the exact facts, is yours. Good luck.",

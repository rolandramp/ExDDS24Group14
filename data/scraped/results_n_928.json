    "title": "Can the trustee find out I am recently married?",
    "question": "I just filed for bankruptcy and just got married. My debt occurred before I met him so I didn't put him in it. Will the trustee find out I am married even though I filed single on my tax return?",

        "As my colleagues stated, it's all a question of timing. If you got married before you filed, you will have to fix your paperwork and it could affect your filing depending on whether you made purchase together, mingled bank accounts, etc. If you got married after you filed, it's pretty much \"no harm, no foul\".. Talk to your attorney and if you don't have one, get one.",
        "More information is needed to give you useful advice. As stated by my colleagues, if you got married AFTER you filed, probably nothing in your case will be affected. If you got married BEFORE you filed, you will have to amend your paperwork accordingly.",
        "Which did you do first? If you were married before you filed, you should amend your Petition/Statement of Affairs to reflect that. If you got married after you filed, it shouldn't be a big deal. The trustee may ask you at your hearing if you are married. If so, just tell him or her that you got married after filing. Probably no big deal, just don't lie.\n\nRob"

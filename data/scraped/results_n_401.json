        "Since enactment of the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005, individuals with income above the median based upon the size of their household must undergo a \"means test\", in order to establish eligibility to proceed in Chapter 7. Failing the means test, such debtors are left with proposing a plan of reorganization to pay at least a portion of their debts.\n\nSince it appears that you are a creditor, you have a right to obtain copies of the petition and other documents filed by a debtor against whom you have a claim. If it appears that the information provided in the means test is inaccurate and manipulated to pass the means test in order to file a Chapter 7 for which the debtor is ineligible, you can bring any contradictory evidence to the attention of the United States Trustee for that district. If the debtor instead elects to reorganize, typically under Chapter 13, you are entitled to again obtain copies of all of the filed documents and object to confirmation of the Chapter 13 plan if it does not meet the requirements of law.\n\nThe application of the bankruptcy laws to any given situation is complex. It is not something you want to undertake as a learning experience, and I would advise you to seek competent counsel. There are many attorneys whose background and qualifications can be reviewed in AVVO."

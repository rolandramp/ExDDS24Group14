        "The law is unclear on the issue allowance for contributions to a 401k. Mandatory retirement contributions are deductible from gross income under the Means Test when calculating disposable income. Voluntary contributions are not deductible for the purpose of the Means Test. However, when looking at the a debtor's overall financial situation a voluntary deduction for 401k may be allowed as a valid expense on the Debtor's Income and/or expense schedules (I and J).

If you have a limited amount of funds in your retirement account and you plan on retiring in 10 years a contribution of 5% may be deemed reasonable and necessary for your support.

        "That's a great question. The short answer is no. No one is going to force you to reduce or eliminate making voluntary contributions to a qualified retirement account. You don't specify how much you are contributing or wish to contribute. In my experience, trustees will view voluntary contributions to retirement accounts in the range of 3 - 6% as reasonable. Trustees don't view such payroll deductions in a vaccum, however. Trustees and courts also take into considerations such variables as a Debtor's age and the amount of funds already available in existing retirement accounts. Certainly, it can be argued that contributing 5% when your employer will match dollar for dollar is a very reasonable (and prudent) investment choice. A voluntary contribution of 10 - 15% may not seem so reasonable to a chapter 7 or 13 trustee, however. In my opinion, the amount contributed to a retirement account will be a bigger issue in a chapter 13 case as compared to a chapter 7 case. Expenses and payroll deductions tend to be more heavily scrutinized in chapter 13 cases. The good news is that in chapter 13, reasonable voluntary retirement contributions may act to reduce the amount of money you will be obligated to pay your unsecured creditors. Reasonable contributions are not viewed disfavorably by the trustees or courts, especially if you have a proven track record of making such contributions and you aren't merely trying to game the system.",
        "The answer to this question may be different in different parts of the US.

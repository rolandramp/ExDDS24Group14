    "title": "Are wages considered community property? Can I garnish wages to collect on a judgment if defendant's spouse is in bankruptcy?",
    "question": "I recently was awarded a judgment and the defendant will not pay what is due. I plan to have her wages garnished, but her husband has filed chapter 7. She is not listed as a co-debtor and her wages are not claimed on their bankruptcy forms (she is listed as unemployed).",

        "I'd a little unclear here. First, as a general notion, since the wife didn't file bankruptcy, her wages are free-and-clear as far as garnishment is concerned - community property doesn't protect them. But, if she is listed as \"unemployed\" in the husband's bankruptcy petition, why do you think she has wages to garnish? Either you're wrong, and the wife is unemployed, or the husband committed bankruptcy fraud, which should be brought to the attention of the court."

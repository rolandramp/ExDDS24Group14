    "title": "I signed up with a debt relief company and cancelled 2 days later. I got a letter from a creditor they were closing my account.",
    "question": "I decided that I did not want to go this route and emailed my cancellation from to them 2 days after I signed up with them. Now I am afraid after receiving this letter that all of my creditors will do the same and I will not have any credit. What can I do? On the 30th they charged me a 25.00 processing fee to get set up and only returned 16.00. They had my cancellation form long before they charged this fee.",
    "answers": [
        "I doubt that your brief 2 day fling with the settlement company caused the cancellation. The account was probably closed because you were behind on your payments."

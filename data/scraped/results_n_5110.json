        "Was the judgment entered by a court in the State of California? If not, you need to domesticate the judgment. After you have a California judgment, you must record a certified copy of an Abstract of Judgment in each county where the debtor's real property is located. That creates a lien upon all real property in that county.\n\nYou cannot exactly \"force a sale.\" You can foreclose on your judgment lien. If this is the debtor's home, be prepared to pay the amount of the debtor's statutory homestead exemption. $75,000 or more. The Sheriff will handle the sale. The property will still be subject to any prior liens, such as earlier judgments, mortgages, tax liens, etc. The Sheriff will do the sale. The sale expenses get reimbursed first, then you get your money, then the debtor gets anything left over. Also, if the property is the debtor's residence you will need to go to court to get permission to foreclose and you will need an appraisal.",
        "You are putting the cart before the horse. Get the lien first, then investigate how to sell the property. You may need to make yourself aware of the exemptions under California law that will prevent your from taking property protected by state law. I am posting a link to a general description of property that you cannot take from a debtor, but only one of these exemption laws applies if the party does not file bankruptcy. Hope this perspective helps!",
        "The short answer is yes, there are procedures in California in place to force the sale real property to help satisfy a debt. Whether or not it is feasible to do so is entirely another matter. if you are trying to force the sale of the debtor's home, you have to prove there is enough equity in the property to pay off the mortgages, pay the applicable homestead exemption to the judgment debtor and then still have enough value to generate money to pay toward the judgment.\n\nBefore incurring the costs to do this, it might be a good idea to contact a title insurance company to investigate the status of any liens on the property and possible an appraisal. if the property is worth $300,000 and they owe $275,000, you will not be able to sell the home."

    "title": "My husband and I are getting a divorce after 21 years of marriage, and he is asking for spousal support, is it possible?",
    "question": "He doesn't want to work, he had a heart attack, but the Doctor told him that he can go back to work, that was 3 months ago, and is receiving unemployment but just enough to support himself. We have a daughter but she is turning 18 in less than a month. He is asking the court for spousal support. What I make is not enough to maintain him, I support my daughter, I'm in a low income. He has credit card debts and are on his name but he wants me to pay his too. My credit cards are in my name, do I have to pay his? I have to respond in 10 days and I can't afford to pay a lawyer. Could you please help me? Thank you.",

They will be able to help answer many of these questions and get your Response filed in a timely manner.\n\nFor now here are some quick answers to some of your questions:\n- you likely will have to split the credit card debt equally under community property laws\n- if he is cleared to work, he should get a job\n- he should not get any spousal support assuming your incomes or earning capacities are similar\n\nBest regards,",
        "You've presented quite a few questions here, which are not well answered in this forum. However, generally in California, spousal support is available to either a husband OR a wife, based upon earnings, earning capacity and marital standards of living prior to the divorce. In other words, it is possible for him to get support if he presents appropriate circumstances for it. With respect to debt, again as a general rule, any debt inucrred durring marriage (in California) is community debt, regardless of whether it is in one spouse's name alone or not. You should consider seeking some assistence, at least a consultation, so that you understand your rights, responsibilities and legal position. Good luck."

        "I'm not sure what the other answer was talking about by filing an answer.... you haven't been sued from what I can tell in your question. You just got a letter demanding money.\n\nIf you look up FAICollect, they are a company from Washington state that appears to be another type of civil demand company. While I personally haven't had any of my clients get letters from them. their website appears to be a debt collection agency.\n\nThe thing is though.... based on what you wrote, I don't see that you have a debt. A civil demand letter is only as good as the paper it's written on. I could send you a letter asking for a million dollars. Does it mean I could ever collect a million dollars from you?\n\nMe: (Out of the blue) Give me $500.\nYou: No.\nMe: Fine. I'm taking you to collections.\n\nThat doesn't make any legal sense.

        "The first thing you need to do if and when you get sued is file an Answer.

    "question": "I am beneficiary of parent's trust. I have read that a trust is a private document and not probated. Is the trustee required to publish a \"Notice to Creditors\" before distribution of trust assets to beneficiaries? I have read conflicting answers on this topic in California.",
    "answers": [
        "It is not required. Not sure what you read that was conflicting. The procedure is under Probate Section 19100 and is voluntary.",
        "The notice to creditors procedure is optional for trust administrations, but required when an estate goes through probate. There are good reasons to use it, and good reasons not to, depending on whether there are likely to be significant claims against the trust and it would make sense to shorten the time in which creditors may assert claims. It may also depend on how much time has passed since the death, and how much time remains on the one-year statute of limitations for claims against a decedent.",
        "\"Is a trustee in California required to \"publish\" a \"Notice to Creditors\" of deceased?\" -- No. However, a trustee has many duties including the obligation to pay certain medical liens, file tax returns and pay taxes, and pay debts of the decedent as required by the terms of trust. If you eventually become successor trustee it will be important for you to consult a CPA and an attorney to help you fulfill your duties as trustee."

    "title": "My husband is being sued by CACH LLC, original creditor Bank of America. He will go to the court hearing.",
    "question": "Would it be better to accept whatever the court dishes out or better to file bankruptcy? We have 3 other outstanding bills that are now in collection agencies and what if they decide to sue also? We did try bankruptcy a few months ago, but we wanted to do Chapter 7 and the lawyer said we had to do 13 cos he makes too much money. He didn't tell us all of the nasty details about 13, such as we wouldn't have hardly anything to live on, etc., i had to find all of the cons online myself. So we cancelled it before it ever went to court. What kind of a verdict does CACH LLC usually get? What to do?",

        "\"we wouldn't have hardly anything to live on\". Well, you don't pay your creditors off at a penny per year; money has a time value. In order to pay them off, even where you eliminate most of the debt, everything you make over a reasonable about to \"live on\" goes to your creditors for 3-5 years.\n\nIf you let the lawsuits get ahead of you, then the creditors WILL be paid off much sooner, but by taking assets, bank accounts and garnishing wages, BUT there won't be the diminution in the amount owing as will happen with bankruptcy.\n\nIRS and FTB can be even more demanding and troublesome.\n\nPlease remember to designate your question's BEST ANSWER.\n\nPlease remember to designate your question's BEST ANSWER.\n\nCurt Harrington\nCertified Tax Specialist -- State Bar of California Board of Legal Specialization\nElectrical-Chemical-Mechanical Patent (Intellectual Property) Attorney\n(562) 594-9784\nhttp://patentax.com/curt/index.html\nAbout Curt: http://patentax.com/curt/index.html\nVisit the Library: http://patentax.com/library/",

        "You need to prepare your case before you go to court. Propounded discovery requests. Make them show you proof that they now own the debt. Collections agencies usually have great difficulty in getting witnesses and admissible evidence to court when they need to prove the original debt, the computations and the chain of title. You need a lawyer to represent you. Otherwise, you will undoubtedly lose. So you are probably looking at Chapter 13, which you could have avoided by talking with a lawyer back when you were first served with Summons and Complaint."

    "title": "Is it true there is a $100 charge for each individual credit card account being owed to in a chapter 7 bankruptcy?",
    "question": "Hello, I went to a free consultation with an attorney today for a chapter 7 bankruptcy and when going over the charges, they mentioned that aside from the attorney fees, credit report, and court filing fees, there was a $100 charge for each individual credit card account to which I carried a balance. Is this accurate, and if so, is it a fixed rate or depends on individual attorney? Thank you!",

    "title": "Should my grandpa transfer his house to me before filing bankruptcy?",
    "question": "My grandfather is elderly and on a fixed income. He is slowly accumulating more debt than he has income. He has two cars, both in his name, but one is for my brother. He also owns his home free and clear but I believe it is in a trust deed. He doesn't want my brother to lose the car but paying it off and transferring to my brother might bring up issues as part of the look back period. So would he need to \"sell\" it to someone other than family? As far as the house it is already stated to go to us once he passes in his will. Except the deed is in a trust and not his name. We tried to get his lawyer to help us revoke the trust but he said we didn't need to. We want to transfer the house to us to avoid creditors trying to sue or putting a lien on the house, but could that possibly be reversed during the bankruptcy filing as well? My grandfather might not make it past the year and he is slowly unable to comprehend these issues. Should he even file for bankruptcy or just transfer the assets and let everything go?",
    "answers": [
        "I agree with my colleagues, you are suggesting some very dicey things that can get turn into a disaster for your grandfather. Your grandfather should not transfer assets to other individuals before filing for bankruptcy, these are fraudulent transfers. I recommend your grandfather speak with a couple experienced bankruptcy attorneys to determine what is the best course of action for him.",
        "A transfer of the house at this time would be considered fraud. He instead should look at transfer into a irrevocable trust, and/or negotiating directly with his creditors, and/or cutting way back on expenses, such as deeding the car to others who can drive. But to transfer to relatives just before bankruptcy will blow up in your face.\n\nHe should consult with a trust and estates atty to help him in this process. Try to avoid BK.",
        "This situation sounds like a disaster waiting to happen. And I am not referring to the debt your grandfather is slowly incurring.\n\nThe things you suggest are the problem. You are proposing what sounds like the fraudulent transfer of a vehicle to your brother and the fraudulent transfer of your grandfather's house to yourself. Then there is potential bankruptcy fraud. Looked at uncharitably, there may be financial abuse of an elder.\n\nYour grandfather needs his own lawyer to help your grandfather figure out what is best for your grandfather. The phony sale of assets or gifting away of a house free and clear when there are other debts are probably not in your grandfather's best interest."

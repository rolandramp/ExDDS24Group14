        "Generally speaking, the issue is not whether you have standing as a judgment creditor per se.

To pursue that route (and any other) you should consult a local attorney.\n\nYour inquiry also indicates, however, that you have a judgment against the debtor. Did you obtain a judgment lien ?

        "Creditors do not have standing to undo or pursue fraudulent conveyances.\n\nGenerally, as brother counsel has stated, you would raise this in an objection to discharge.

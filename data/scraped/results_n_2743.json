    "title": "If Bank of America breached the trial loan modification agreement, is the permanent loan modification agreement enforceable?",
    "question": "Bank of America ignored the terms of their trial modification agreement, mismanaged my monthly trial modification payments by not deducting principal, interest, and escrow which has caused a negative status in my current escrow account, miscalculated the permanent loan principal balance, posted a pre-trial payment with a trial period escrow payment, reduced principal balance from a pre-trial payment, reported late payments to credit bureau(s). The trial modification agreement states do not make pre-trial loan payments during trial period, all late payments will be waived and monthly trial payments consist of principal, interest and escrow. The online transaction history consists of many reversals, vague postings, and grouped transactions. The first permanent loan payment was on 10/1/2014.",

        "What you experienced is quite common. If you complied with all terms of HAMP, you are entitled to permanent modification. You must prove compliance.\nIf not HAMP, you may have basis for lawsuit for negligence and fraud against BA.\nAlso consider BK C13 or C7 options. Need more information to opine further.\nTime of the essence. Review all facts and discuss all options with BK counsel.",
        "If you made all your trial payments on time, you probably have a strong negligent misrepresentation claim against B of A for not honoring and/or offering a permanent mod. However it is likely you'd have to sue them to enforce these rights. Most likely they will want to offer you a new review, which is not necessarily a bad thing.\nAs far as where and how they applied payments, it is often a difficult and slow process to figure out where and why they applied payments the way they did, this also may require litigation as well. Lenders typically just give you evasive answers when you try to figure it out directly with them unfortunately. If you have any additional questions, please feel free to contact my office.",
        "I agree with my colleague. If you we approved for a HAMP Trial Loan Modification which is under a government program, the lender is obligated to provide you with your permanent loan modification. You will need to show that you made all of your payments until when/and if the lender started rejecting them. Call a foreclosure attorney so they can review your documents and see if you have a breach of contract claim against Bank of America. If you did miss payments then a better option for you may be to file Chapter 13 to catch up on your loan. Either way, call a foreclosure/bankruptcy attorney to discuss your situation. Hope this helps!",
        "BoA is notorious for screwing up the loan modification process. That said, a trial loan modification by its definition is not permanent. The bank is not bound to grant a permanent loan modification unless and until you have it in writing. If you do, the bank can be held to perform that agreement. If you don't have it in writing, your remedies are limited. A proper Chapter 13 can bring arrearages under the protection of the BK court. If you have a 2nd TD and are \"under water\" it is possible to strip the 2nd TD and discharge it in BK. Find/consult/hire a BK lawyer. BK is not a DIY project. Click the Avvo tab, \"Find a Lawyer\". Many of us offer free consultations."

The 703 section you would want to read THOROUGHLY and confirm with your retirement paperwork is CCCP Section 703.140(b)(10)(E). If you are trying to protect a substantial amount of money, and you have any other assets that need protection, you definitely want to hire an attorney to prepare and file your paperwork for you.",

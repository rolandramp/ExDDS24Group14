        "I think the attorneys above and beyond have covered this question. The only outstanding issue that I could see is what is your role in this? Without knowing your role or your interests, it is difficult to help guide you to where you want to go. You should consider confidentially meeting with an attorney.",
        "This question appears to be related to the last that I answered for you. This is offered as a reiteration of the response that you received above. The general partnership (an additional fact not included in your first question) can do business as such (under its own name, without a FBN) provided that it meets the statutory requirements for doing business in that fashion. A general partnership's name should include the last name of each general partner in the partnership and should not suggest the existence of other partners. If it does not, the general partnership should in fact file and publish its FBN in compliance with applicable law.\n\nGoing back to the other response, the fact that the \"partnership\" is in fact a general partnership with a GP-1 on file with the Secretary of State is a significant fact. A general partnership is not a separately taxed entity. Rather, it's a conduit for profit or loss to flow to partnership members. Each partner shares equal rights and responsibilities in managing the general partnership. Protection from liability is NOT a benefit of a general partnership. Each general partner assumes full personal liability for the debts and obligations of the partnership. That means that the partnership is not a shield from liability, but merely a device to protect the identity of the trust. That said, there may be other reasons that the trusts have chosen to do business via the partnership. You really don't know, and no lawyer here can guess one way or another. Hire an attorney.",
        "Yes, a partnership filing with the Secretary of State has nothing to do with a fictitious business name filed with the County Recorder.\n\nSee a lawyer to unravel this complicated business structure.",

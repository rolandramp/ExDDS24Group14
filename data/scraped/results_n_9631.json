    "question": "The parents are immigrants from Thailand and will be returning there in the next few years. The child is 13 now and been in the US for 7 years. I'd like to keep her in the US to finish out high school and college. Is this possible? I can't find an international adoption lawyer in all of Los Angeles County. All the adoption lawyers I've spoken with say this is not possible.",

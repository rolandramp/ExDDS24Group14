        "As stated by my colleagues, the Means Test requires you to accurately report your income/expenses. You put quotes around \"rent\". Why? As to the size of your family, the purpose is to compare your family size against the numbers for the same sized family expenses. It looks like you are trying to avoid having a BK lawyer help you. Big mistake. Find/consult/hire a lawyer in your area using the Avvo feature \"Find a Lawyer\". Make a list of 4-5 having many 5 star reviews from satisfied clients. If you don't get a prompt call back from one, go on to the next on your list. Some offer a free consultation by phone or in person. Take us up on it.",
        "Your mother's income would not be included in the means test calculation. Consult with an attorney in your area. Most bankruptcy attorneys give free consultations and some will consult with you over the phone.",
        "You only include your income and any other income that is contributed to you directly. So, if you mother gives you money, then include it. If she does not, then it is not part of the means test.\nI think the best thing to do is to seek the advice of counsel so you get this done right."

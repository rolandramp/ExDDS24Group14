        "Was the call from a debt collector? You cannot be arrested for not paying a debt. It is very illegal for a debt collector to imply that he/she is calling from any sort of prosecutorial agency or that you can be arrested.\nIf there is some kind of criminal warrant issued against you, get the case number and the location of the court. Then go to the Public Defender. If it is some sort of criminal matter, the PD can tell you what is going on.\nIf the person calling is a debt collector, he/she will say that if you pay the alleged debt today, you will not be arrested, that otherwise the file will go to \"the attorney\", that the Sheriff will come to your place of work and serve you with a Court Summons. If the conversation goes in this direction, just get all of the identifying information about the caller, i.e., name of the individual, name of the collection agency, address, phone and fax numbers, and ask that they mail a demand letter to you. Then, talk to a lawyer about suing this abusive debt collector. In addition to damages for your distress, you can recover up to $1,000, per violation, in statutory damages, plus attorney's fees. If you have a good case, an attorney might take your case without your paying a retainer up front.",
        "Yes, you could have a warrant without knowing about it. But the Court does not call people about warrants. Sounds to me like it was a collection agency trying to scare up some money out of you, or a scammer.",
        "Are you sure that the call was from the Court? Some collection agencies threaten to have people arrested in order to convince them to pay debts - particularly payday loan debts. Such tactics are highly illegal, but they are effective. If that turns out to be the case, you should sit down with an attorney who handles fair debt collection cases.\n\nThe other possibility is that the call was from a police officer and if they have evidence that you have committed a crime they can have a warrant issued. Police officers do not have to give you advance notice before having a warrant issued and it is usually a bad idea to talk to a police officer who is intent on investigating you. If that is the case then you definititely need an attorney."

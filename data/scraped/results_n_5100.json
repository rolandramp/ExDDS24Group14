    "title": "Collection Matter: Time Barred Debt: California I was served on 5/17/13 from an in house attorney at a collection agency.",
    "question": "I found a collection letter from a different agency dated 3/19/09 trying to collect on the same account. I stopped paying due to severe losses in the economy. I was going to include a copy of this letter to the collection atty & explain that they were suing on a time barred debt & if she would stipulate to a dismissal of the suit & save us both time. Is this worth a try or should I just file my affirmative defense answers. My ex wife has all the files in storage so I cant reference the CC file to see when last payment was made. My ex wife is in Europe for the next 4 weeks & I'm pressed for time. I assumed maybe the atty would figure that an account does not go to collection unless it is past due 60 days or more & realize that the debt is more than likely time barred. Please advise. Thank",

        "The end date on the Statute of Limitations is the date when the lawsuit was filed, not the date when you receive a copy of the lawsuit (Summons and Complaint). I suggest that within 30 days of service, you file an Answer and that you alleged, as one of your defenses, that the SOL has elapsed. After that, you can propound discovery requests asking the plaintiff to produce specified, relevant documents which would show the account history and all assignments of the account. You should sit down with an attorney right away for a consultation. The price for a 1/2 hour or 1 hour consultation will be well worth the cost.",

    "title": "How long does a creditor have to produce and collect on a bill after someone is deceased in the sate of California?",
    "question": "My mother died over a year ago. I was executor of her estate (about$300,000) via a living trust. I paid all bills as they came in, sold her home and filed her final tax return through a CPA. After waiting over 6 months for any additional bills I disbursed the remaining funds to the heirs (my siblings and myself). Today, over one year after her death, I received a letter from the care facility she was in stating that we have an overdue bill of $4,800.00. As I recall we paid the care facility in full shortly after her death. We have not received any bills before this one indicating any amount still due. Should I even acknowledge this bill by contesting it. It was sent to her so should I just mark it \"deceased\" and send it back, or ignore it all together?",

        "It depends upon whether thee was a probate estate or a trust administration. In a probate estate (you say that you were \"executor\" of the estate), a Notice to Creditors is sent to all known creditors and is published. After publication the state is administered and then distributed. Such a probate distribution is free and clear of creditor claims. If there was no probate court proceeding, the distribution of the trust should have been done under the supervision of the attorney for the trust.\n\nIn a probate estate after the assets are distributed, and proper receipts filed, the court will enter an order ending the responsibilities of the executor.

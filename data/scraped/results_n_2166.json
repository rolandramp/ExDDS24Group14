    "title": "Does a fraud judgment survive Chapter 7 bankruptcy?",
    "question": "An individual failed to pay me the entire amount due for certain civil engineering services I provided. I sued for fraud, fraud in the inducement, and several other causes of action. Last week, I obtained a $42,000 judgment against him. However, after the judgment was awarded, the person sent me an offer to settle the debt for $5,000. He said that he would file Chapter 7 bankruptcy if I didn't accept his offer.",

I recently had my mentor assist me with a similar case because as they say, \"any attorney that represents himself has a fool for a client...\" I highly recommend him: Harold Thompson of Thompson Wedeking in downtown San Diego. He offers a free consultation.",
        "It would only survive if you file an adversary proceeding within his bankruptcy. Essentially, you would have to sue him within the bankruptcy. Because you already have a judgment for fraud against him, that definitely fares in your favor. Consulting a bankruptcy expert would be best if you don't settle and he does in fact end up filing for bankruptcy.",
        "I concur with Cindy Hill. Contact your attorney right away to determine exactly the basis for your judgement.\n\nYou may need to keep an eye to see whether or not they file bankruptcy (the debt should be listed, and you notified. But don't count on that happening) If the judgment is for fraud, you would then need to file an adversary proceeding (lawsuit in bankruptcy court) and argue that the debt is fraudulent, so not dischargeable.\n\nBest of luck!",
        "Look under 11 USC section 523 to find the exceptions to discharge. You will need to file an adversary action (the bankruptcy term for law suits) in the judgment debtor's bankruptcy. Depending upon the findings in the judgment and how the judgment was obtained (by trial or by default) you may be able to have the judgment declared non-dischargable by summary judgment or you may be required to try the lawsuit.\nI suggest you talk to the attorney who tried the state court suit to verify the judgment is for fraud, and not on one of the other (non fraud) counts.\nIf you chose to move forward with an adversary action I strongly encourage you to hire bankruptcy counsel to help you through the process.",
        "You will need to file an objection to discharge & you will need to do this pretty quickly in a chapter 7. The requirements in bankruptcy to be successful in preventing a discharge are contained in 11 USC sec 523. Hope this perspective helps!",
        "It depends on the wording of the judgment. You say you sued under fraud and also several other causes of action. The Court's judgment may have been based on only 1 cause of action, or several. It's possible the Court didn't find fraud but awarded the judgment on another cause of action. Just because you alleged fraud in your complaint, doesn't mean the Court necessarily agreed and found fraud as a basis for the Judgment. Even if fraud is identified as the basis of the judgment, it may or may not rise to the level of fraud necessary for the debt to be non-dischargeable in a bankruptcy setting. I would recommend arranging for a consultation with a local bankruptcy attorney to review your civil complaint and the precise wording of the judgment. If lacking as-is (for BK purposes), it might be possible to request the Court to amend the judgment to clarify/specify the findings of fact, to the extent fraud may have been found. Or, as suggested in a previous answer, you may need to re-litigate the fraud allegations in an Adversary Complaint in the Bankruptcy Court.",
        "A state court judgment for fraud may very well survive a chapter 7 discharge. However, it is not automatic. The judgment from the state court has to be reviewed to ascertain how the judgment was arrived at, and what the jury/judge found, specifically. Secondly, after the bankruptcy is filed, a discussion with the debtor and his/her attorney may be productive enough to obviate the need to litigate the claim again in the bankruptcy court. Far better to have your situation reviewed by local counsel to put together a game plan.",
        "Fraud defined in bankruptcy law is not the same as fraud as defined in a civil lawsuit. In bankruptcy law there must have been no intention to perform from the beginning versus intentional misrepresentations of fact. You would need to re litigate your fraud claim as an adversary proceeding before the bankruptcy court."

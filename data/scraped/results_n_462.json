    "title": "How will my poor credit, debt problems effect the person I marry?",
    "question": "I live in Los Angeles and own a house. My credit got ruined during the Great Recession of 2008. I got sued (for credit card debt), now I have 2 judgments which created 2 WRITs and 2 liens on my house that were issued in October 2015, for a total of about 30K I owe. Currently I am in good standing on my 150K mortgage, and I have about 25K in credit card debt. My credit score is in the low 500's. If I get married, how will this debt, judgments, liens effect the person I marry who has excellent credit? Will my financial problems become my new spouse problems or can we keep our debt separated somehow? Though I’m still unable to pay the 30K on the 2 judgements currently or in the near future, but I don’t want to sell my house or file for bankruptcy. Since October 2015, the bank (which sued me on the 2 credit cards), will not provide me with a reasonable payback plan to settle the 2 judgments.",

        "Your debt is your debt. It will not become your spouses debt when you get married",
        "The biggest problem that I see is that you have judgments ($30k). If the judgments are not paid, the judgment creditors can garnish your wages and/or levy your bank account. While judgment creditors cannot levy your future spouse's separate property, aggressive creditors can seek a court order to allow them to garnish the wages of the non-debtor spouse, based on the rule that half the non-debtor spouse's income is community property. So you should definitely talk to a bankruptcy attorney about whether you can discharge the $30k in judgments and the $25k in other unsecured debt.",

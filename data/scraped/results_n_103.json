    "question": "I filed bankruptcy in 2010 and got a discharge in 2011. Recently a old creditor took all the money out of my bank account. I was told it was garnished by a creditor using a judgement which had been discharged in my bankruptcy. What can I do about this?",

        "You need to first make sure that this debt was actually discharged in your bankruptcy case. That may depend on the type of debt, whether that creditor successfully objected to the discharge of the debt, whether there were any assets administered in your case and, if so, whether the creditor received proper notice of the bankruptcy filing.\n\nIf in fact the debt was discharged, then your remedy is to seek contempt of court sanctions against them for violating the post-discharge injunction of 11 USC 524. You will need an attorney to litigate that action for you. Of course, the best first step would be to notify the creditor and remind them of the discharge and demand return of your funds.",

This will reveal the type of debt (student loan debt perhaps), all relevant factors regarding the debt and all relevant factors involving your Discharge.\n\nSometimes a discharge is not issued, or the debt is a non dischargeable debt, as indicated.",
        "I agree with Attorney Markus and always simply start with a demand of creditor to return and give them the proof and demand by a date certain and your current mailing address and information., Keep proof of that communication. I find normally that ends it when you receive back the $. If that works you skipped all the other time etc. Good luck.",
        "Talk to your attorney about what to do. If you didn't have an attorney or if your attorney is retired, talk to a new attorney about demanding the funds back, and if necessary filing a motion for contempt and violation of the discharge stay.\nReview your paperwork and make sure the creditor was listed. You attorney or you can send the creditor a copy of your bankruptcy schedule that listed him and a copy of your discharge and demand your funds back.

        "Your discharge was entered in a federal bankruptcy court, and will need to be enforced there as well.\n\nAs a preliminary step, you should make demand upon the creditor to return the garnished funds and provide a copy of the notice of entry of discharge as well as the creditor list from the bankruptcy file that shows the creditor was given notice.\n\nFailing to return your money, the next step would be to enforce the discharge in the bankruptcy court. This will require filing a motion for issuance of an order to show cause re contempt.

Since that can be accomplished quite easily, it would be wise to seek such an order.\n\nIf the court grants the motion and issues the OSC re contempt, it would then be served upon the offending creditor. At that juncture, the creditor may very well throw in the towel and agree to not only return the monies wrongfully garnished, but to pay you your legal expenses.\n\nIf not, and the creditor denies having violated the discharge, the court will set for hearing.

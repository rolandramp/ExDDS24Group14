        "You might want to consider actually statutorily converting your LLC to a Corp under CA law. Under conversion, all of the LLC's debts and assets would, by operation of law, transfer to the new Corp. If you were to simply liquidate and then incorporate, you and/or the other LLC member would first take assets in your name personally before they would be held in Corporate form, which is generally not wise (in addition, in order to actually dissolve an entity, it has to pay off all of its debts).\n\nThus, by converting to the Corp, whatever debts the LLC owed to you would still be owed to you by the Corp. As part of the conversion, all the llC members would get stock in return for their LLC interests. As a stockholder in Corp you could then sell your stock to the other shareholder or have the entity redeem your shares (you could finance the sale of the stock and likely take installment sale treatment of any gains, if there were any).\n\nDisclaimer: This does not create an attorney client relationship but simply serves as a general response to a general inquiry.

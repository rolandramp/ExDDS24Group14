    "question": "I have been separated (not legally) from my husband for over 5 years. We filed tax returns together during 4 of those years. Last year I filed for Divorce and filed taxes separately. The divorce is not final and my husband has become terminally ill. He has applied and received Medicaid for a 6 month period but no more after that and he may live longer than the six month period, incurring medical bills. Since he is dying, he asked that I not continue with the divorce (better pension benefits for me that will allow me to provide more for my adult children) so I filed a Dismissal of my case. It just came to me this morning that I might be responsible for his debts. Since we have not lived together for 5 years, am I responsible under the Doctrine of Necessaries?",

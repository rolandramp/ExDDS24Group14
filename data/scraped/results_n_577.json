    "title": "As a co signer am I liable if the car was repossessed?",
    "question": "My ex husband co signed on a car for our daughter. The car was respossessed. He is 80 years old, lives in New Mexico & owns his home there. Our daughter lives in California. The lender is going after him for $18,000. He is on Social Security and does not have the money to pay this. What are his options?",
    "answers": [
        "When you co-sign on a loan, you open yourself to the legal concept of \"joint and several liability\", which means that the creditor can go after either co-signer. for the entire amount owed. Your ex-husband should review his options with a bankruptcy attorney in New Mexico.",
        "Yes, you are liable as a co-signer. If the $18,000 is not satisfied then the lender could come after you.\nHe can call a New Mexico bankruptcy attorney and see if bankruptcy is a good option for him. He would qualify for a chapter 7 based on his income, he would just want to make sure the equity in his home can be protected. He could also do a chapter 13 to pay off the debt over time if his home cannot be protected in a chapter 7. If he files bankruptcy and obtains a discharge, however, the lender could still come after you for the balance owed, so you may want to consider your options as well. Hope this helps.",
        "He should contact a bankruptcy attorney in New Mexico to find out if bankruptcy is an option, based on his income and the amount of equity in his home. If bankruptcy is not an option then he would try to dispute and/or litigate the alleged debt in order to reduce the number and settle with the creditor. If that's not an option he may wind up getting sued, having a judgment entered against him and having that become a lien on the home."

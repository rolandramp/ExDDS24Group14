    "title": "Is it legal for a mediation firm to contact people you know to tell them you are being sued?",
    "question": "I was contacted by a mediation firm to negotiate an outstanding debt this morning. The firm told me this was the only way to stop further legal proceedings. This same firm also contacted my mother (I'm an adult) to tell her they were trying to reach me regarding a lawsuit that I am involved in, they said they needed to \"serve\" me. We do not live in the same residence, nor do I know how they got her number (it's not listed and she just recently moved to this home). Is this legal? If not, what can be done to stop such collection tactics?",

        "No mediation firm works in this way. A mediator only works after he/she is contacted by both sides. What this \"mediation firm\" is doing is using misleading tactics to try to collect a debt on behalf of a creditor. Also, contacting a relative and telling the relative that you are a debtor is also an unlawful debt collection practice. From what you said, you have grounds for a lawsuit against the mediator/debt collector. If you have a valid suit, and if you can prove the necessary facts, you can recover \"actual damages\" for your aggravation and distress, plus \"statutory damages\" of between $100 and $1,000, per violation, plus attorney's fees. I suggest that you consult an attorney who has litigation experience in FDCPA cases. As far as \"service\" of a lawsuit, you can check the court's index to see whether your name appears on the court's records. If you live in LA County, you can go to any civil courthouse and, in the clerk's office, run your name on their computer. If your name comes up, there will be a case number. If not, they have not filed a lawsuit. The threat to file a lawsuit, unless made by an attorney licensed to practice in California, is also a violation of the FDCPA.",

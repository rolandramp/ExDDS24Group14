        "My understanding (and bear in mind that I am not licensed in California, and you need to get legal advice from someone who is to rely upon it!) is that a grant deed which contains (only) two guarantees:\n• the property has not been sold to anybody else and\n• the property is not burdened by any encumbrances apart from those the seller has already disclosed to the buyer.\n\nA Quit Claim deed merely conveys any interest that the grantor might possess in the property without any guarantees.\n\nThere are other forms of deed and the use of any can convey the property, but with varying results and consequences to the parties.\n\nI urge you to consult with a local licensed attorney, (yes, not a real estate agent or title company, but an actual attorney who is licensed in California and can give you advice based on your specific situation!) to be sure you are using the proper form of conveyance. This is 'cheap insurance' to make sure this won't cause you problems later!",
        "Exceptions to reassessment apply (e.g. Parent Child Exemption), make sure to file a Preliminary Change of Ownership Report and CFRE with the deed.",
        "The question assumes the trust now presently owns the property. It cannot be determined if the original settlor/trustor is still alive and wishes to transfer the property now to the beneficiary, or it is the successor trustee who intends to transfer according to the terms of the trust to the named beneficiary. If the latter, then it would ordinarily be the duty of the successor trustee to do so immediately after all other requirements of the trust are completed (usually payment of debts and expenses). There is a \"Trust Transfer Deed\" which is commonly used and generally acceptable. This has no effect on the encumbrance and it is up to the lender whether or not there will be an assumption and on what terms."

    "title": "How does Chapter 7 work for a car with 2 liens?",
    "question": "I have a car with two liens--one is a bank loan in the first position, the other a title loan in the second. I have a co-signer on the loan that is in the first position, the bank loan. I'm assessing my options at this point. I would like to either file Chapter 7 and reaffirm the bank loan only or sell it and pay-off the bank loan and discharge the title loan. I assume any amount I sold it for over the $3800 I would have to send to the title company. The car is worth $5500. The first position bank loan is for $3800 and I'm current on it. The title loan is for $4000 and I'm behind payments on it. I'm not sure that the title company actually put a lien on the title. I checked on the NMVTIS report and didn't see either as having recorded a lien so I'm not sure where to look.",

        "I've never seen a car with two liens either. Your personal obligation to repay gets discharged, the creditor's property right in the vehicle as collateral, assuming there is one, survives the BK, reaff or no reaff. Reaff means you agree to be personally liable by entering into a new agreement post BK. If you stop paying on the loan with co-signer, that person's credit will be effected and they can be persued by creditor unless that co-signer also files or already filed BK.",
        "The first issue is really the actual FMV of the car\n\nSecond is do you car about cosignor.\n\nThird is has cosignor also filed or expected to file a bankruptcy.\n\nFourth is whether there is any equity in the car. I have NEVER seen 2 liens on a vehicle.but dont know or seen everything..just wonder how they would have name on title when first lender holds title. You should obtain legal advice from an attorney in the State governing the car loan and contract to ascertain whether any other loan is secured.\n\nFifth, I have reaffirmed maybe 5 cars in 31 years and over 8,400 persons I have helped file. Thus, if a car is wanted to be kept, most (99%) clients just pay as due..but if they change they mind later, they let it go..the debt is discharged (to the debtor, not co-signor).\n\n\nDont assume the \"value \" of car as is that retail? tradein? private party? etc. You file to get rid of debt and keep that in mind.\n\n\nOther issues can affect your case so I will point those out next for you..on this Saturday! You need and want to enjoy your fresh start also. But the most important thing is to meet with an attorney as you asking this question means you have not. You care about 2 goals: keeping everything you have equity in and discharging all your debts. If you don't have any of the exceptions to discharge you will obtain that goal; most exceptions are set forth in 11 USC. 523 (Google it) like child support, some income taxes, traffic (in a ch 7) and criminal fines , and presumption of student loans. But some debts are dischargeable in a ch 13 but NOT in a ch 7 so you want to make sure and your attorney will discuss any such types with you also!\n\nYour exemptions depend on what state you have lived in in the last 2 years and thus if in your state, then your states exemptions will apply. Most persons filing keep everything they own but your attorney will confirm that with you when they learn everything you own and the equity thereof!\n\nSome secured debts like homes, vehicles, other secured debts an attorney will discuss your options on also as you must list any debts; but that does not mean you will lose them unless you have too much equity or are in default on paying for them! Discuss those options if they apply with your attorney too.\n\nBut other issues can arise that can greatly harm your case. Just one example: If you paid back a relative $3,000 11 months ago and now file bankruptcy next week, the trustee can SUE that relative to retrieve that $3,000 (under what is called a preference) for the benefit of the bankruptcy estate. As a result, most attorneys don't charge to meet with them the first meeting so meet with one no matter what.\n\nMany great attorneys can be found right here on AVVO in your state so look, call, and meet one as soon as you can.\n\nYou should also want to know when to file: is there an advantage of waiting versus filing now and who should you pay between now and then! Good luck and enjoy your later fresh start.",
        "I doubt very much there is a 2nd lien against your vehicle. Most likely the \"2nd lien\" is simply an unsecured debt.\nBest of luck."

    "title": "I let someone use my credit card with the understanding they would pay it off including interest. How is interest calculated?",
    "question": "I allowed a friend to use two of my credit cards to pay expenses and misc associated costs (approx $7500) for her family member's funeral, with the understanding that she would make the card payments, and then pay them off in full when the estate was settled (within 3-6 mos.) It took 3 years for probate to settle. Over the course of the three years, I was paid $1500 towards the loan. I have continued paying the monthly credit card bills and interest; I've transferred the balances to 0% cards, the 0% intro offers ran out, and so the interest rate went up again, etc. I realize I have complicated the situation, but I was trying to minimize the amount of interest that would have to be paid. I am going to have to sue or place a lien on the house she inherited (?) for the remaining $6000 + interest, but don't know how to calculate the interest since over the course of time the rate has fluctuated.",

        "Unless you want to hire an attorney to review everything the only general analysis I could give you would be for you to sue her for any interest you paid on cards, balance transfer fees if it was less than the interest, etc.\nThat is assuming she knew you were putting all of this on a credit card that would cost you interest. If she did not the court will likely only award you statutory interest at most.\nYou are not going to be able to place a lien on the house until you get a court judgment. If you had done the loan properly from the beginning, however, you could’ve had a lien placed voluntarily which would’ve also given you the authority to foreclose on the house if she didn’t pay you.",
        "The core of your question is a math problem, not a legal problem. This forum is not a math form. However, you do have some legal hurdles.\n\nCandidly, it isn't clear you are entitled to any interest. I don't think a small claims court is going to try to unpack that issue. You didn't mention if you had a written agreement (most people would mention that), so I will assume you didn't. I think a court would say that you loaned the defendant $7,500. The fact that you did so on a credit card is your problem, not the borrowers.\n\nThat isn't to say you have no argument that you should be entitled to something extra, but you will have to specifically prove the interest charged on that balance. If you can't do that, the court isn't going to figure it out for you. If you comingled other charges on that card, you would likely lose that argument (again, the court will take the path of least resistance).\n\nIn order to place a lien, you will have to sue and obtain a judgment.",
        "I believe the reason you have not seen any answers, as attorneys have answered Bankruptcy and Debt area questions in hundred comments since you posted, is that you are trying to obtain a legal specific answer and this is a General Forum. Go see an attorney in your state and bring in all those facts. Sure, you will pay, but then you have legal advice you can rely on . Also, rules and local rules can affect advice. Also, other rules of defenses to a lawsuit must be looked at too including Statute of Limitations, laws re oral agreements, etc. Thus, call one next week so you can obtain an accurate, full, complete answer. Good luck."

    "title": "Can a unsecured creditor avoid a fraudulent transfer committed by a Debtor who filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy?",
    "question": "Debtor owes me thousands of dollars pursuant to a dissolution settlement agreement. Debtor has never paid and recently filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 13. Debtor classified the debt owed to me as unsecured. I have missed my deadline to file an adverse proceeding related to debt resulting from divorce. As a creditor, I would like to set aside the fraudulent transfer of a substantial amount of money Debtor gave to a close relative instead of paying me as court ordered. The trustee has not filed the adversary proceeding. As a creditor can I file instead?",

        "Attorneys Riddle and Adams have give you accurate advice. Do the following things in this order: (1) get an experienced BK lawyer who specializes in Creditor Rights; After listening to that advice, (2) Contact the Chapter 13 trustee with your information as to the fraudulent conveyance; (3) file your claim in the Chapter 13 case. Sometimes well drafted marital settlement agreements can survive a BK. I don't know whether yours was. Good luck.",
        "Creditors can avoid transfers. Chapter 13 generally do not file Adversary Complaints to bring money into the estate. However the trustee can and should bring an action to vacate the confirmation if the dividend could be increased by the calculation of the fraudulent transfer. Also, under certain circumstances the convert could convert the case to a Chapter where a Chapter 7 could bring an action to recover a fraudulent conveyance to be used for the benefit of the estate and not one particular creditor.",
        "Hopefully some CA lawyers will pitch in to answer how Judges have ruled there, as creditor standing to pursue avoidance actions is sometimes allowed and sometimes not allowed. If there is a chance, you might first file a motion with the Court to allow you to pursue the claim. Get the Chapter 13 Trustee's consent in advance if possible. However, economics come into play. How much are you willing to spend on legal fees for what could be an expensive case, to get assets for the Bankruptcy estate? You might consider bringing this matter to the attention of the US Trustee, objecting to the plan, or seeking dismissal or conversion. What happens if you spend a lot of money and the case is dismissed? Finally, it is not necessary in all cases to file an adversary for a domestic support obligation. A bigger problem may be missing the deadline to object to the plan. You need a lawyer."

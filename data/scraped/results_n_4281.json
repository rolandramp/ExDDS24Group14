    "question": "I have two companies with the same name accept one is an llc and one is an inc. they both have different tax id numbers. this may get a bit convoluted so bare with me. I had an account with the dwp, under the name of the Inc but the fin of the llc (the dwp made that mistake) I was recently robbed for almost everything I had and now I have a 100k power bill. I tried to work out a payment plan but they wont help at all. I have another company under the same name with the dwp as well. My question is if I dissolve the llc and open an account with the inc, will they be able to file a judgement against me or the Inc?",

        "DWP can and will sue anyone responsible for the debt. If you signed a personal guaranty, you will be named in the lawsuit in addition to your companies. Don't waste time or money dissolving the corp or LLC, instead, file a personal bankruptcy if you signed a guaranty for the DWP debt. Contact me or any AVVO bankruptcy lawyer offering a free consultation if further information is needed. Good luck.",

    "title": "How long after filing a Chapter 13 BK (in California) do I have to wait to get married?",
    "question": "I am planning to file a Chapter 13 BK on May 1, 2013 -- when some of my IRS debt will be eligible for discharge. I understand that I will begin making payments on June 25th. I am now engaged and would like to get married in early July 2013. Will this be a problem? How long after I file should I wait to marry? If it matters, my future spouse filed a Chapter 7 BK during his divorce that was filed in 11/2010 and discharged around 4/2011.",

        "This is a tricky scenario. The short answer is, you don't have to wait to get married, but getting married could definitely affect your plan payment. Since all income you earn/receive during your Chapter 13 case is property of the bankruptcy estate, if you get married during your case, then your community property interest in your spouse's income will become property of the bankruptcy estate. What this means specifically for your case depends on the facts, such as whether you are already proposing to pay unsecured creditors 100%, or less.. If you're paying less, then there's always the possibility that the Chapter 13 Trustee or creditors will seek to increase your plan payment after you get married (assuming your spouse has any income).\n\nThere are other factors involved here as well, so you really need to have an experienced bankruptcy attorney analyze your entire situation and advise you on the best way to proceed.\n\nMark Markus has been practicing exclusively bankruptcy law in California since 1991.

        "AND, each of the calls to the relatives that were not a legitimate attempt to \"find you\" are violations of federal and state law and actionable and come with a nice little penalty if proven.\n\nAND, each threat to use the criminal justice system against you comes with similar penalties.\n\nThere are any number of good attorney in and around LA who are qualified to take a lot of this worry off of your hands. Bob Brennan in La Crescenta comes to mind. Other possibilities for someone who handles FDCPA issues can be found at http://www.naca.net",
        "Tell your father in law not to worry, this is a sleazy collection agency, not a credit union, and they're violating federal and state debt collection laws. Not only can they not file criminal charges (only a DA can do that, but they can't even report this to the police, since this is a civil not criminal matter), but you can sue them for their blatant violations.\n\nThey can't threaten tp do something they can't actually do, like file criminal charges. They can't call your relatives repeatedly.\n\nArm your father in law with this information if they call him again, and have him write down the full name and company and title and phone number and address of who he speaks with and the day/time before he counter-threatens them. They'll stop calling him.\n\nWhether filing for bankruptcy is a good idea depends on your entire financial situation, so see a bankruptcy lawyer to discuss it."

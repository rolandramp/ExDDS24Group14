    "question": "Filed for chapter 7 in 09 when my husband passed away. Filed chapter 13 in 2013 but cancelled it because I wanted to give back my car as I owed more on it than it was worth. I refilled in 1/14 and cancelled that because I couldn't keep the payments up and my attorney fell short with getting back to me on my questions.",

        "You can file again. I agree with the other attorney's comment about reimposing the automatic stay. Also, beware that in certain jurisdictions the courts are now giving the trustee a report about previous filings. Courts and trustees do not like repetitive filers and will look for reasons not to cut you any slack. I would strongly encourage you to hire an attorney with a good reputation in bankruptcy court. This will go a long way in showing the trustee and the judges that you are serious about this third trip into bk court.",
        "Yes, you can file again. The more important question is can you afford a monthly plan payment to address the priority portion of your tax debt? You need the advice of a good lawyer who can determine this for you.",
        "As most of the attorneys have indicated in the answers to this question: you need to hire an attorney. You certainly CAN file a Chapter 13 on your own - nothing in the bankruptcy code prevents you from representing yourself. However, hiring an experienced attorney can help you get through the process more efficiently and help design a plan for you that you can manage financially.\n\nYou mention that a prior attorney \"fell short with getting back to me on my questions\" - if you don't feel like the attorney you meet with will work well with you then find one who is. Ask questions: \"How will you communicate with me?\" \"How often will I receive an update on my case?\" and so on. Make sure the attorney you hire is a good fit for you.",
        "You appear to be aware that you can't file a chapter 7 for a few more years, but it is likely you would be able to file a chapter 13. The median income test in a chapter 13 determines if you can file a plan which pays for fewer than 60 months. If you are below the median, you can file a plan with payments over 36 months or more (up to 60 depending upon how much you need to pay)\nAs indicated by other counsel, the filing and dismissal of prior cases could cause issues on a new chapter 13. You should contact experienced bankruptcy counsel, of which there are many in your area.",
        "You need to speak with an experienced bankruptcy attorney near you. There is a great deal of additional information required before anyone can give you a realistic answer to your question. The fact you have two prior Ch13s in the last year and 2/3 is concerning and will likely require a motion to impose or extend the stay which will be difficult for a lay person to handle without assistance. Fortunately many bankruptcy attorneys offer free initial consultations.",
        "It sounds like you have attempted Chapter 13 yourself without success-- twice. Without the capable assistance of experienced bankruptcy counsel, why would your third try be any more successful? Be aware that the Bankruptcy Code handicaps repetitive filings with special restrictions. If you are finally serious about completing a Chapter 13 Plan, retain counsel.\n\nBest wishes for an outcome you can accept, and please remember to designate a best asnwer.",
        "You are never required to hire an attorney in order to file bankruptcy, but I recommend it 100% of the time. Given the circumstances you have related in your question, you absolutely need an attorney. I do not know how the court views multiple filings in your district but where I practice, it is scrutinized. Under the bankruptcy code, your past case filings, even though they were ultimately dismissed, will effect your future filing.\nIt sounds like you may have had a bad experience in the past with representation, so make sure to do your due diligence in finding representation this time around before you choose an attorney. However, I would in no way recommend filing your case pro se. Best of luck to you."

    "title": "What can a debt collector ask legally in CA?",
    "question": "I called a debt collector to say I am unemployed. She asked if my spouse's income is only income in home. I am single. Can she legally even in roundabout way, ask my marital status? I said the only other income in household is not related to me and has nothing to do with me. Should I have said anything?",

        "Don't call them anymore, you have nothing to gain by it. As my colleagues noted, they can ask ALMOST whatever they want, but what they can't do includes:\n\nasking you to pay more than you owe\n\nmisrepresenting the amount you owe. [15 USC 1692e] § 807(2)(a)\n\nasking you to pay interest, fees, or expenses that aren't allowed by law and that aren't included in your original credit/loan agreement [15 USC 1692f] § 808(1)\n\ncalling repeatedly or continuously - the federal debt collection law, the FDCPA considers repeat calls as harassment. [15 USC 1692d] § 806(5)\n\nusing obscene, profane, or abusive language, which is considered harassment. [15 USC 1692d] § 806(2)\n\ncalling before 8:00 am or after 9:00 pm - calls during these times are considered harassment. [15 USC 1692c] § 805(a)(1)\n\ncalling at times they knew or should know are inconvenient - this is considered harassment. [15 USC 1692c] § 805(a)(1)\n\nusing or threatening to use violence if you don't pay the debt - [15 USC 1692d] § 806(1)\n\nthreatening action they can't or won't take, like threaten to sue or file charges against you, garnish wages, take property, cause job loss, or ruin your credit when they can't or don't intend to take the action. [15 USC 1692e] § 807(5)\n\ninform a third party about your alleged debt, unless you have expressly given permission. This doesn't include your lawyer, the creditor, and the creditor's lawyer, a credit reporting agency, your spouse, and your parent (if you're a minor) [15 USC 1692c] § 805(b)\n\nrepeatedly calling a third party to get your location information, whcih they can only do once unless it has reason to believe the information previously provided is false. [15 USC 1692b] § 804(1).\n\nThese cites are from the federal law, and CA's version of the law is even more protective of consumers/debtors, and it includes the creditor as well as collection agencies.\n\nIf they call you and you want them to stop, you have to demand that in writing, and they have to stop, and you can sue THEM if they don't. Send your letter by certified mail to prove receipt.

        "I know of no principle of law that restricts what questions the debt collector can ask you. including your marital status. The debt collector is not interviewing you for a job.

        "As the prior write indicated, this is a common problem. If you don't want the car you might think about physically returning it to the bank.",
        "The First Circuit decided In Re Pratt. In that case, the debtor, through counsel, filed a complaint for violation of the discharge and demanded that the title either be released OR the creditor take the car. The alternative is a Motion to Redeem for $1.\n\nThe debtor cannot get rid of the car without the title and will be stuck with it forever without doing something. Either of these actions will get the lender's attention.",
        "This is a common problem. Your liability is wiped out but the car lender still retains it's lien on the vehicle. The company is not obligated to release that lien since Chapter 7 only eliminates \"unsecured\" debt. However, the vehicle is not worth recovering in the eyes of the company. So you have a vehicle that they do not want. Assuming it is working... enjoy it payment free. However, if it is not working there is a problem. You can not sell it without the title being released. You can make a nominal offer to the car lender in exchange for releasing title. Barring that working, even a salvage yard won't take it without proper title. You'll have to get creative if you are attempting to dispose of it. Good Luck.",
        "It is legal because your personal liability on the loan is discharged but the lien as a security interest remains. I have prior success with clients who sought a declaratory judgment to quiet title in a local court. That may be an option for you."

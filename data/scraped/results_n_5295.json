    "title": "After partial satisfaction of judgment, do I need to get a new writ of execution to levy outstanding amount?",
    "question": "I won a large small claims judgment that I have been working on collecting for months. The sheriff's department levied the judgment debtor's bank account and recovered roughly 50% of the judgment. I now want the sheriff's dept. to perform a second levy on another account to collect the outstanding amount. Do I need to get a new writ of execution from the clerk that reflects the partial satisfaction of judgment and the current amount owed? Or will the original writ, with instructions to the sheriff to collect only the unsatisfied amount suffice?",

        "You would need to get a new writ of execution that reflects the credits (i.e., the amount you have been able to collect so far)."

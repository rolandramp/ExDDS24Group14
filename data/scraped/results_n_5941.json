    "title": "Am I responsible for a student loan that my husband co-signed for his and ex-wife's daughter?",
    "question": "My husband through divorce agreement with his ex-wife that he would be 100% responsible for their daughter's college loan. I have an excellent credit. If my husband, due to unforeseen circumstances, default on his daughter's college loan, can the creditors come after me since he is now my husband? Since we live in California, I am afraid that all his liabilities will become my responsibility since we're married. Or am I safe, since I didn't co-sign for any education loan?",

        "Accord with Mr. Williams' response. Whereas obligations incurred by either spouse during a marriage would normally be characterized as community debts, you should be safe from claims from the lender under those circumstances.",
        "The loan would be his separate property debt. That is not to say creditors wont try to play games to trick you into something, but once all would be said and done, they are his separate property debts and cant legally affect your credit."

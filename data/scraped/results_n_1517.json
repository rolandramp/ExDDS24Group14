    "question": "I am asking my husband for a divorce and would like to know the pros and con's of a divorce? We've been married 23 yrs. and he is the bread winner. I work part-time. I plan on moving back to Hawaii. We have 2 grown sons.. The youngest is in his last year of college.",

        "Unlike a divorce, with a legal separation - you remain married and can enjoy the legal benefits of that status (joint filing of tax returns, remaining insured under a spouse's health insurance policy, remaining as husband and wife on real property title, social status, conformity with some religious tenets, etc.) The downside is that you can't remarry. Note that many of your rights will be determined by the legal separation agreement.",
        "You're asking a great question. A divorce and legal separation are virtually identical in terms of the orders you can obtain in each: custody/visitation orders, spousal and child support orders, property and debt division orders. However, with a legal separation, you are still married, which means neither of you can marry someone else. Also, if you were to file paperwork for a legal separation, and your husband files a response requesting a divorce, your case automatically becomes a divorce case. It only takes one person to want a divorce--the other does not have to agree. There are several reasons that people will commonly seek a legal separation instead of divorce such as their religion prevents divorce; they need to carry the other other (or be carried by the other) on a health insurance plan, they do not meet the jurisdictional requirements for a divorce, or they hope to reconcile but need orders in a legal separation in the meantime to protect their children, assets, debts, or finances. If you file for legal separation and obtain a judgment of legal separation in your case, you must open a whole new case to file for dissolution when you are ready to end the marriage. Hope this helps!",

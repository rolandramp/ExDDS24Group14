        "Consider fighting back. Were you aware that Midland got a judgment against you in the first place? Many attorneys will give you a free consultation - take it!",
        "Several options:\n-pay the judgment;\n-attack the judgment if not valid for substantive or procedural reasons;\n-negotiate with creditor;\n-consider BK options to avoid avoid enforcement of the judgment\nTime of the essence. Consult BK counsel.",
        "If you have enough income to make them an offer, they might agree not to garnish. Many creditors will accept an offer just to see if you can make the payments. Then if you fall behind, they have a stronger case for garnishing right away. If you can't realistically pay this debt in 5 years, you should consider filing bankruptcy. It does involve all of your debts and assets, but a garnishment can turn your life upside down.",
        "Unless the judgment is substantial, or unless you have other debts that add up to about half your annual income, bankruptcy may not be the right choice. Under that circumstance, contact the creditor's attorney to make payment arrangements to settle. If you can come up with a lump sum of cash, you can get the best deal, but if you need to make payments, at least your money won't be going towards law enforcement fees. Hope this perspective helps!",
        "Usually bankruptcy is one of the few ways you are able to stop a garnishment. You should should see a lawyer in your area about the possibility of bankruptcy, especially if you have a lot of other debt. If you have limited other debt, then you can still find a lawyer to help you review the judgement and discuss whether there are any other options available to you under state law.\n\nYou can find an attorney in your area by using Avvo's Find a Lawyer tool. Bankruptcy consultations are usually free and the attorney will be able to review your entire debt situation, determine what chapter bankruptcy you qualify for, and go over any pros and cons to filings bankruptcy.",
        "Going backward, you should have contacted an attorney at the time you were served with the lawsuit.\nThese Midland lawsuits are normally easily defended by a consumer attorney.\nGoing forward, filing for bankruptcy may give you a fresh start and stop the garnishment.\nYou can find an attorney in your area on AVVO or use the link below to find one."

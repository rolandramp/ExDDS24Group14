        "Disclaimer: Any information provided is general in nature and NOT considered legal advice for your specific situation. You should consult with an estate attorney to get advice specific to your situation.\n\n\nFirst of all, there are legal requirements in California regarding trust administration which include a \"Notification by Trustee\" pursuant to Probate Code Section 16061.7. You can find the probate code online if you wish to attempt the administration on your own. I would advise using an estate attorney familiar with trust administration to keep you out of trouble.\n\nYou need to get valuations on all assets held in the trust on the date of death, pay all outstanding bills (if they are legitimate) and if there are a lot of bills, you may opt to go through the court's creditor claim process for trusts. Also, you should know that creditors have up to one year to collect from an estate. So, if you distribute all funds from the estate immediately, there is the possibility that a creditor could come after you and/or the beneficiaries for payment of any outstanding debts of your father for up to one year from his death.\n\nYou will be responsible for a full accounting to all beneficiaries which will include the date of death values, plus any income received (including any refunds or interest and dividends) less any expenses of the trust (payment of bills, taxes, payments to trustee, attorney and accountant) and the remaining assets ready to be distributed. Needless to say, this is an abbreviated version of what needs to be done and does not include all tasks required of a trustee.\n\nKeep in mind a trustee is a fiduciary and has an obligation to be neutral to all beneficiaries. You must remain neutral during the administration and keep very good records of all assets of the estate and all money spent for any expenses during the administration until the trust is completely distributed.\n\nIf your father passed in 2009 and his estate is anywhere close to $3.5 million, an estate tax return may be required. You should consult with his accountant regarding his final personal tax return (which is still due on April 15), as well as any tax return for the trust. Since your father's social security number is no longer valid, you will need a tax ID number for the trust. Most banks will ask you for this when you try to close out accounts.\n\nAlso, if any accounts or real property are not currently titled in the name of the trust, you may have to probate those assets. Hopefully, all accounts and real property are in the trust; if an account names a beneficiary, that will bypass the trust entirety and be distributed directly to the beneficiary.\n\nI strongly urge you to consult with an estate attorney in your area to assist you or to give you some guidance.",
        "When you say \"covered by the trust,\" wat do you mean?\n\nIn order to avoid probate, all assets have to have been transferred to his name as trustee of the trust, or be what we call nonprobate assets (e.g., a jointly owned financial account, joint tenancy with right of survivorship property, an IRA, 401(k), life insurance, annuity, etc. with a benficiary designation of the trust or someone other than the estate). That is your first task - find out whether the assets were properly \"funded\" or coordinated with the trst and the plan.\n\nIf not, you may have to probate assets under the pour-over will I assume accompanies the trust.\n\nIf everything is coordinated, there is nothing to file with the court. You will have to notify certain payors like social security and pension, file a final income tax return (and, perhaps one for the trust post-mortem), perhaps file an estate tax return, determine the date of death value of capital assets to calculate the stepped up basis, etc. There may be a nonprobate creditor claims procedure in CA you might choose to avail the estate of.\n\nGood luck. Buy an hour of a local attorney's time who is competent in post-mortem trust administration and probate.",
        "I am not a CA attorney, so my comments are general in nature. Usually, a funded trust continues to operate without interruption on the death of the grantor of the trust. If your dad was the trustee while alive, then the successor trustee assumes that office at that time. Some authorities who have trust assets may want a death certificate to allow the successor trustee to commence operations as such.\nBe careful here if there are probate assets found, since his will would need to be probated. Hopefully, in this case, the will had a \"pourover\" provision that transfers the probate assets to the trust.\nTo be safe, you should retain an experience CA estates lawyer to confirm the general comments above and to assist you in this administration.\n\nHope this helps.

        "Just because you believe the repossession was conducted illegally does not make it so. There are two ways to approach this — 1) Do nothing and wait for the collection agency to file suit. You can then raise the illegal repossession as an affirmative defense. The risk here is if you lose the extra interest that is added on will make the amount due that much more; or 2) start asserting the illegal repossession, and documenting your efforts with certified return receipt letters, with proof. Send copies of the prior letters, gather declarations of witnesses. Send a demand for validation of the debt. Establish that you are aware of your rights. In some circumstances the debt collectors will back off when you start asserting your rights — as long as you back it up with documentation and legal authority. In others they will send the debt back to the original creditor and it will be reassigned to another recollection agency for you to start all over again. These even happens when attorneys write the letters."

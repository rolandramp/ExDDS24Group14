    "title": "Can a paid off motorcycle be repossessed in a chapter 7 bankruptcy in CA?",
    "question": "My husband and I are filing for Chapter 7 in Calif. He owns a motorcycle outright. I'm not using an attorney because we can't afford it, so free advice is appreciated. Can his bike be taken? We are not making payments. Thank you",
    "answers": [
        "Any property not exempt can be taken by the trustee for distribution to your creditors. Therefore, if you cannot exempt the motorcycle it might be taken by the trustee and sold. The trustee gets a commission, pays the expense of the sale, the trustee's lawyer's fee (yes, the trustee has a lawyer and usually one of the best around) and the creditors get the balance. Obviously, the trustee might not be interested in a cheap bike. Filing bankruptcy without a lawyer is a leap of faith so make you know what you are doing because once you file a Chapter 7 you cannot dismiss the case without court approval and if there is unexempt property the trustee will oppose dismissal. At the very least you should first read a book like the one on Chapter 7 by Nolo Press cover to cover. You can then decide if you need a lawyer or not. You can do the case without a lawyer, you can replace all the pipes in your house, you can give your husband a hair cut and you can set your own broken arm so long as you learn how to do it.",
        "If it is paid for, there's no creditor who can take it. But the question concerns exemptions, which is what you're allowed to keep from the reach of the trustee's ability to sell. I don't practice in CA so I don't know what the exemptions there are, and it depends on how much you own in total.\n\nIncidentally, I never suggest one file bankruptcy without an attorney. While the fee may seem high, debtors are discharging thousands of dollars in debt and an attorney can save you trouble and money.",
        "I know you said that you cannot afford an attorney, but I am recommending that you seek the advice of a bankruptcy attorney in your area before you file for bankruptcy. Usually, attorneys will give a free initial consultation.\n\nWhen you file for Chapter 7 Bankruptcy, it is kind of like pushing the \"reset\" button. Your unsecured debts (e.g., credit cards, medical bills) are discharged, which means that you don't pay them assuming that fraud does not exist.\n\nWhen you push that \"reset\" button, the Chapter 7 Trustee will look to see what assets you have that they can take from you to sell and distribute to creditors. For example, if you have a Ferrari sitting in your garage that is paid in full and worth $100,000.00, then the Chapter 7 Trustee will want it to sell at auction and distribute the monies that are not protected to the creditors.\n\nIn California, CCP 703.140(b)(5), which is also known as the \"wild card\" exemption, allows you to protect assets up to $23,250.00 of equity in any assets that you and your husband own. This includes the equity that your husband has in his motorcycle. Mind you that this is one of many exemptions. There is also an exemption for vehicles that is $3,525.00, which can be applied only to one vehicle.\n\nSo to answer your question about whether your husband's motorcycle will be protected, I can't answer the question because I don't know how much the motorcycle is worth and I don't know the value to all of your other assets (e.g., money in the bank, furnishings, clothing, etc.). You should go to www.KBB.com to see how much the motorcycle is worth. However, if all of the assets combined (including the motorcycle) between your husband and yourself are equal to or less than the \"wild card\" exemption of $23,250.00, then I think it is fair to say that your assets are protected.\n\nBest of luck to you!\n\nJonathan Panossian, Esq.\nLaw Office of Jonathan Panossian, A PC\n\nwww.JRP-LAW.com\n\nAttorney Advertisement\nDisclaimer: The information contained on this website pertains to the law and legal procedures in general.

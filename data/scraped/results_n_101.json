        "The simple answer is that such benefits belong to your daughter, and should not be affected by your bankruptcy. Moreover, Social Security benefits are entirely protected and not included in property when filing a bankruptcy case.\nIn the recent case of In re Buenviaje, No. 2:16-BK-15191-VZ, 2016 WL 8467650, at *3 (B.A.P. 9th Cir. Mar. 10, 2016), the Ninth Circuit Bankruptcy Appellate Panel held that \"We hold that 42 U.S.C. § 407 “operates as a complete bar to the forced inclusion of past and future social security proceeds in the bankruptcy estate.” Carpenter v. Ries (In re Carpenter) (“Carpenter III”), 614 F.3d 930, 936 (8th Cir. 2010)\".\n\nYou should feel safe and filing and not be concerned that your daughter's Social Security survivor benefits would be jeopardized in any way.",

        "The question is not clear; who is filing for bankruptcy, and who is receiving the benefits? If the benefits go to someone other than the bankruptcy debtor, then they would not appear to be part of the bankruptcy estate. Additionally, Social Security benefits are generally exempt from seizure by the Trustee, but an inheritance may not be. So, it will depend on the facts.",

        "As you can see by a prior answer and Court cases cited in general it is not part of the estate. But how it is treated in Schedules in my view depends. If daughter 's social security is used to pay you $300 rent for example, I myself include the $300 rent on Schedule J but also she is listed as a dependent as she has a roof over her head, utilities etc. But you asking that question implies you have not in fact employed a bankruptcy attorney and that would be a mistake. You have GREAT attorneys on AVVO I have seen many many times their answers in CA and you have one already answering your question. Most work is done on emails and on phone, and not in person and even Court is on telephone. Thus, call one now. Other issues and facts can affect your case so I will point out some now to make you realize there are many other parts to filing bankruptcy and why persons w/o an attorney have huge problems often.\n\nYou need and want to enjoy your fresh start also. But the most important thing is to meet with an attorney as you asking this question means you have not. You care about 2 goals: keeping everything you have equity in and discharging all your debts. If you don't have any of the exceptions to discharge you will obtain that goal; most exceptions are set forth in 11 USC. 523 (Google it) like child support, some income taxes, traffic (in a ch 7) and criminal fines , and presumption of student loans. But some debts are dischargeable in a ch 13 but NOT in a ch 7 so you want to make sure and your attorney will discuss any such types with you also!\n\nYour exemptions depend on what state you have lived in in the last 2 years and thus if in your state, then your states exemptions will apply. Most persons filing keep everything they own but your attorney will confirm that with you when they learn everything you own and the equity thereof!\n\nSome secured debts like homes, vehicles, other secured debts an attorney will discuss your options on also as you must list any debts; but that does not mean you will lose them unless you have too much equity or are in default on paying for them! Discuss those options if they apply with your attorney too.\n\nBut other issues can arise that can greatly harm your case. Just one example: If you paid back a relative $3,000 11 months ago and now file bankruptcy next week, the trustee can SUE that relative to retrieve that $3,000 (under what is called a preference) for the benefit of the bankruptcy estate. As a result, most attorneys don't charge to meet with them the first meeting so meet with one no matter what.\n\nMany great attorneys can be found right here on AVVO in your state so look, call, and meet one as soon as you can.\n\nYou should also want to know when to file: is there an advantage of waiting versus filing now and who should you pay between now and then! Good luck and enjoy your later fresh start.",

    "title": "Do I need to pay the account that's 'closed at credit grantor's request'?",
    "question": "i've now settled all my debts except for a smaller debt (under 1k) that's noted as 'account closed at credit grantor's request'. This is more than 5-6yr old debt, and is time-barred debt. Should I ignore it, or is it better to search and find out who to pay at this point, and make sure to pay since i've settled the other ones also?",

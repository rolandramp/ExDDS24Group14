    "title": "My attorney does not have my best interest in mind, can I change attorneys in the middle of my bankruptcy?",
    "question": "It is clear to me now that I am 5 months into my Chapter 7 Bankruptcy, that my attorney either made a huge mistake or he we negligent in telling me some very important information about my situation. If I choose to change my attorney now, can I do it? I have already paid my current attorney all of his fees, yet, now that he has my money, it seems as though he could care less what happens to myself and my family. What are the laws affecting me? Do I have any recourse when it comes to getting some money back for services NOT rendered?",

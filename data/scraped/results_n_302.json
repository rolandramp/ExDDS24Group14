    "title": ". Can I discharge this lawyer in bankruptcy",
    "question": "I am a beneficiary of a trust through quiet title settlement. When my mom passed then I get half of house. My lawyers put in the trust settlement that they will recover fees from my half when she passes. Can I discharge this attorneys fees if I don't sign a promissory note?",

    "answers": [
        "I agree with the above that bankruptcy is a bad plan.\n\nWhen you say \"trust settlement\" do you mean it is something your mother signed as the settlor? Or is it something you agreed to in a settlement agreement?\n\nIt sounds like you didn't have money to pay an attorney up front and these lawyers got involved with the understanding that they would be paid out of the property being passed to you.\n\nIs it because you feel the amount charged is unfair or unreasonable? (Do you yet know the amount being charged, or is it fluid because it is ongoing?)\n\nIf you have a dispute over the reasonableness of the amount claimed, you could always initiate a fee arbitration with the State Bar.",
        "Changing this to BK. This is a BK question not a probate question.",
        "Not likely. You agreed to pay an attorney, the attorney did their job and got you a settlement, and now you want to file BK to stiff the attorney. Don't see a bankruptcy court allowing that.",
        "Let me see if I understand you. You’re trying to ask a bunch of lawyers if you can stuff the lawyer he did a good job for you. Do I have that right? I think I’ll leave my answer that before I say something I’ll regret."

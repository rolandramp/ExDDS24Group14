    "title": "In a chapter 7 Schedule J - for the tax portion - how much priority tax payment do I need to put?",
    "question": "I owe back taxes and I was wondering for the chapter 7 schedule J, do I need to put a certain payment amount?",
    "answers": [
        "You can only list payment of a tax debt on Schedule J if you are actually making the payment. Going to pay in the future will not cut it with the Bankruptcy court, and if you make this mistake, I suspect you will make a bunch more, which will result in your pro se bankruptcy filing a nightmare. There are lots of unwritten practices in bankruptcy, so proceed at your own risk. The results of making a bad guess can be pretty high. Hope this perspective helps!",
        "Your question seems to ask about 3 different things.\nRegarding the priority of tax debts owed, it would be listed on Schedule E. You would list the taxing authority it is owed to, the balance amount and identify it as a tax obligation.\n\nSchedule J are for monthly household expenses. If you have a repayment obligation with the governing tax entity, of a non-dischargeable amount you intend will be a continuing obligation, you can put in that monthly obligation for monthly tax payments.\n\nAs for qualifications, as another pointed out, that is based on income-expenses on the means test. Based on tax obligation, there isn't a section for you to be picking and choosing how you want to divide and represent the tax obligation. I believe whatever you are reading may be meaning something else or for something else; not how you're trying to represent the tax obligation. As similar to the schedule J response I provided above, there is a section on the Means Test (Form 122A) to provide additional expenses that should be considered a part of your monthly expenses with an explanation. If you have a continuing tax obligation that cannot be discharged, then that would be a good section to put the actual monthly obligation that you owe (if you have an agreement in place for monthly installment) or how much you predict you'll owe monthly (to get an agreement in place for monthly installment).",
        "The Means Test, not schedule J, determines initial qualification for chapter 7 and length of chapter 13. The Means Test has its own formula for payment of priority debts, such as most taxes. Please contact an experienced bankruptcy attorney to discuss your situation to determine your best options and their relative risks and benefits, as it sounds like you are trying to go this alone without understanding the process.\nFor instance: not all taxes are priority, and some taxes can be discharged. you need to know what to include in your Means Test calculations before you decide what to do.\nSchedule J provides projections for future expenses. Obviously, the dischargeability of any tax liablities will go into that calculation also, but schedule J is substantially different in usage than the Means Test.\nLook for experienced bankruptcy attorneys on AVVO in your area, and set up appointments with them to discuss what you need to do. Many give free consultations, so you can get an idea of what to expect before you need to pay anyone anything.",
        "I highly recommend you hire a lawyer to represent you. Certain deductions on the means test are set by law, including the amount of priority tax liability you can take as a deduction. Schedule J doesn’t determine Chapter 7 eligibility, although it may be looked at in determining whether your case should be dismissed based on the totality of the circumstances and your ability to pay creditors. The bottom line is you’re going to need to hire a lawyer to get the type of advice and guidance you’re looking for."

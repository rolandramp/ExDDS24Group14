    "title": "Is it net income for means test for chapter 7 bankruptcy?",
    "question": "I was wondering if someone can explain how the means test for chapter 7 bankruptcy works. Is it monthly net income that is looked at to pass the means test? I have a family of 6 so I think in California it is $9000 monthly income to automatically qualify. If my net income is $11,000, does the means test look at the total expenses totaling $11,000? Or does the means test look at gross income? Thank you for your advice.",

        "The median income portion of the test relies only on the Gross income.

        "The first thing you look at is gross income, then you look at the IRS allowed expenses for a family of your size with adjustments for extraordinary expenses. There are programs on the internet that can help walk you through it, but nothing beats a meeting with an experienced bankruptcy lawyer. I have gotten many an over means test income client under the threshold by careful analysis of the expenses. Many of my colleagues on this forum can as well.",
        "The median income is regularly updated. As of today, the median income reported by the US Trustee for bankruptcy cases filed on or after May 1, 2018, for a household size of six is $108,149. This equates to roughly $9,000 per month as you mentioned. The mean's test considers gross income. Without really considering anything, because no information was provided, you're likely going to have a difficult time if your net income is $11,000 per month. You may still qualify for a chapter 13 bankruptcy. I recommend meeting with an attorney and paying for a means test evaluation. They will evaluate all available information to better calculate the means test. If you don't pass the means test, they can tell you roughly how much your monthly payment will be for a chapter 13 bankruptcy. Good luck."

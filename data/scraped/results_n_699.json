    "title": "Can I convert my current chapter 13 bankruptcy into a chapter 7 and still keep my home if I continue to pay my mortgage ?",
    "question": "My wife and I filed chapter 13 around a year ago. We currently own our house with about $50k in equity. We are current in our plan payments but my wife took on a new job last year and she’s not making as much $. Our attorney mentioned earlier last year that we can always convert to a chapter 7. My main concern is keeping my home. If we convert to a chapter 7 would we still be able to keep our home if we continue making mortgage payments? I called my home loan company today (chase) they told me they were considered “pay & retain” and that we “should” be able to keep our home. I’m just concerned because I would not want to do that if it’s not a sure thing. Any advice would be great!",

        "There is another thing to consider. That is whether you have any assets other than the home that are NOT EXEMPT. A good example of this would be if you had cars with more than $3,050 total equity. The Chapter 7 trustee could take and sell them to get to the unprotected portion of the equity in the car. Other items could be cash in savings or checking accounts or insurance beyond what could be exempted that existed before you filed your bankruptcy. Other potential issues could be wndfalls or inheritances. I suggest you go over all these issues carefully and completely with your attorney before you convert your case. It could be just fine or it could be a disaster.",
        "Assuming you did not file to bring mortgage arrears current, it is likely your would be able to keep your house by maintaining payments, but you really need to talk to your own attorney, as there are several variables that would affect the answer.",
        "You should speak with your attorney about your situation and your desire to convert to a ch7. Assuming you are current on your mortgage and the account of equity in your home fits within allowed exemptions in your state, you can keep your home as long as the payments are made.",
        "If you have an attorney, I would urge you contact them. You can convert a 13 to a 7, but you will have to meet a change of circumstance (sounds like you do), and qualify under the Means Test. The issue with your home would be whether or not there were arrears. Only a Chapter 13 can resolve arrears on a mortgage, not a Chapter 7."

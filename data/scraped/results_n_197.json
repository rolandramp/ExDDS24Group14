    "title": "I have firsthand knowledge of my cousin declaring false bankruptcy.",
    "question": "This is in the \"east county\" area of San Diego County, CA. My cousin, who is 75 years old & receives both Soc Sec & a pension, is bragging about how she is deliberately racking up bills & then is declaring bankruptcy so she doesn't have to pay for anything, and \"they can't touch me.\"",

        "Call the Office of the US Trustee in San Diego - 619-557-5013. Let them know you want to speak to someone at their office about abuse of the bankruptcy system with what is know as a \"credit card bust out.\" They will ask for the case number and the name of the debtor. If you don't have the case number, you can give them the name of the debtor. If the case was just recently filed, they will follow up on it. If the case is months old, it might be too late for the US Trustee to do anything. These sort of cases give the system a bad name.",
        "The bankruptcy system has all the necessary checks and balances in place. If you are not a creditor your cousin, it may be best to just stay out of it if you want to protect yourself.",
        "Your cousin may be in for a rude awakening regardless of what you do. Depending on exactly what she is doing, her plan may not work out as well as she thinks.\n\nFirst and foremost, she can't keep the car in a bankruptcy without paying for it so it's unclear that she is going to get much benefit from that. I suppose she might be able to drive it for a couple months before it is repossessed, but then she will lose it even if she files for bankruptcy protection. Further, she will be facing very high interest rates and very aggressive debt collection in the future if she wants to buy a replacement vehicle. I'm not clear how that is a \"win\" for her. Bankruptcy will NOT provide her with a free car.\n\nAs for racking up the credit cards, she can get away with some of that. However, if she makes really excessive charges on one card for non-essential items leading up to the bankruptcy filing she is likely to be faced with an adversary complaint wherein the creditor challenges the discharge of that debt and those charges survive the bankruptcy filing.\n\nThere is a saying in bankruptcy that 'pigs get fat and hogs get slaughtered'. The system is such that a debtor can get away with discharging spending that is a little bit excessive, but if they get out of control they can face challenges from creditors to certain expenses or even a denial of discharge due to a lack of good faith.\n\nIf you are really concerned about your cousin 'getting away with something' then once she has filed her bankruptcy case you can contact the U.S. Trustee's office and tell them everything you know about her nefarious plans. They will investigate and if they believe the abuse is serious they can file to have the case dismissed and discharge denied due to a lack of good faith.",
        "It's possible to legally file for bankruptcy protection ~ every 8 years, and it's required to disclose prior bankruptcy filings, so serial parasites like your cousin do have to follow certain rules to take advantage of the laws.\n\nTrump ran casino businesses into the ground and declared bankruptcy 4 times, and still found lenders will to lend him money for further speculation.\n\nWhy anyone trusts your cousin with credit is unknown, but it's their loss, as well as the taxpayers.

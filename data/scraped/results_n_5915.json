        "Here is the form that your employer likely received informing him that he needed to withhold money from your checks. Take a look at #1 on page one, and then go back to your employer with confidence that he needs to provide you with the information you requested:\n\nhttp://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/wg002.pdf\n\nIt may also be the case that you are being garnished if you owe back taxes or child/spousal support. The form would be different, but the employer would still need to tell you.",
        "No only is your employer allows to tell you, the are REQUIRED to tell you. When the Sheriff's department served the garnishment order on your employer, there was an instruction telling them to give you certainly paperwork related to the garnishment.\n\nI agree with the suggestion of scheduling a meeting with the HR department to see if you can get copies of the applicable documents.

If you cannot acquire or find any of those documents, you can consult with an attorney and outline your debt obligations, and that will provide a good foundation for the attorney to conduct and investigation and find out who is garnishing your wages and why."

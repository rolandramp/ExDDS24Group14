        "There are STARK differences in general credit repair like Lexington Law (which is a glorified version of what you can do for yourself through AnnualCreditReport.com) and the WJA program leveraging the federal consumer protection laws.

Only when an account is removed will Lexington Law typically add a new account to dispute. That is why their Yelp complaints include gripes about up front deletions and then stagnation.

        "I have published a 10 part series about the things you can do to rebuild & repair your credit & the entire list of my legal guides is at the link below so you can scroll though & find this information. Lexington Law's expertise is in removing negative information from a credit report & I think they do a good job with this. But in my opinion, repairing credit requires both elimination of bad info & creation of good info, and creating good info isn't something credit repair can do. IMHO, most people won't take the steps to repair their credit themselves, so hiring Lexington may be better than doing nothing. But this isn't going to give you a miraculous result. Hope this perspective helps!",

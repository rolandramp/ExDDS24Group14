    "question": "I start a LLC as a single member. I want to trademark my LLC name.",
    "answers": [
        "Yes, you can still be personally liable. If the registered owner is the LLC, that will protect you personally from most Trademark claims.",
        "The LLC will not protect you from Trademark infringement liability. Trademark infringement is a personal wrong (tort) and extend to whoever directed the infringing activity. You can register the trademark in your name or the company's name, it does not make a difference as far as liability concerns.\nFor more information, I suggest that you contact an experienced Trademark/ IP attorney who can advise you in confidence about your options and potential costs. Many IP firms offer an initial free conference by telephone, video conference or in person if you are available locally and would be happy to speak with you. Call and speak with an experienced Trademark attorney who can assist you.",
        "You are free to hold the trademark in your own name or in most cases it will filed under the entity as a asset of that company.\n\nThe LLC will not protect you from intellectual property infringement claims because those are considered personal tort actions. That is, people commit those violations they are not something arising out of the ordinary course of business operations like contract liability for example. If it were any other way, nothing would stop us from making a business model out of infringement then allow the LLC to take the fall when caught only to set up another and start all over again right?\n\nThat said, know that merely registering your business name with a state or county agency or acquiring a domain does not convey any right to use that name in commerce as a source identifier or trademark. For example, I can presumably register my new tech start up \"Boogle\" with the CA secretary of state because there is no other business already doing business there under that name, but this does not mean that I would not be infringing on the Google trademark, which I would be. The onus is on you to ensure the name you choose is not a problem.\n\nIf you have never actually properly cleared your trademark, this would be your best next step because for all you know there could be someone located elsewhere but doing business in your area or who has a federal registration and prior rights. Your trademark will be one of if not the most important and valuable business assets you will have and you will ultimately spend more money in support if it than you will anywhere else (advertising, marketing, PR, branding, packaging, etc.). So you owe it to your business and yourself to make sure you handle this properly upfront and the first order of business always starts with a proper and comprehensive clearance.\n\nWhenever you endeavor into investing in a trademark it is very important that you conduct the proper clearance due diligence upfront and before you start spending any money in support of it or submit an application to the USPTO. In the US, this means searching under both federal (USPTO) as well as common law because trademark rights stem from use in this country NOT registration.

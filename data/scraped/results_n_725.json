    "question": "I am in the process of doing the chapter 7 documents myself (I cannot afford an attorney).I have read about your bank accounts being frozen from a judgement.Do I get to appear in court before the judgement is rendered to show that if my account is frozen with my paychecks that are direct deposited I would not be able to pay my rent or even buy food.? I have one company saying they are going to take legal action if I don't disagree with the debt amount(which I can't dispute) within 30 days . I cannot finish the forms needed for the bankruptcy and file them before the 30 days they said and I don't know how long it takes for them to get a judgement to freeze my bank account",

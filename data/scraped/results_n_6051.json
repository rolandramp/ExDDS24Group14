    "title": ":bankruptcy: Do SSI and SSA benefits need to be listed on my chapter 7 means test?",
    "question": "just wondering",
    "answers": [
        "Is it your benefits or someone elses benefits? Because if you have a roommate that is paying you money from social security benefits, the money you receive is no longer considered as social security benefits, but rent or some other type of income.\n\nHope this perspective helps!",
        "As have been previously stated all benefits received must be reported on schedule I. If you are attempting to pass the means test in order to qualify for a Chapter 7 you do not include them on the means test.",
        "Any benefits received under the Social Security Act are excluded from \"current monthly income\" to be included on the means test. I'm not sure what the difference between SSI and SSA benefits are, but I guess they are both administered under the Social Security Act and would be excluded.\n\nHowever, they DO need to be included (if regularly received) on Schedule \"I\" and might affect your eligibility in that regard, although that is going to be dependent on the Trustee and Judge in your case, as well as the quality of your attorney in arguing for the proper result.\n\nMark Markus has been practicing exclusively bankruptcy law in California since 1991.

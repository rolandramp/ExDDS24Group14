    "title": "If the debt was omitted knowingly and intentionally with concrete proof, does it make the debt nondischargeable with no excuse?",
    "question": "I am the creditor of a Ch 7 no assets case. At the time of filing, the debtor knowingly and intentionally omitted the loan on her bankruptcy schedule. 17 months later she reopened her case and tried to add me on the list. After the case has been reopened her attorney put this sentence in the document \"The debt has been discharged despite having not been scheduled and despite debtor agreeing to no discharge.\" This is equivalent to admit that the debt was knowingly and intentionally omitted at the time of the bankruptcy filing. Does \"despite\" make a good reason?What exactly is the correct legal ground for knowingly and intentionally omit the debt (so many precedents can be cited). In this case, is the debt nondischargeable with no further excuses?",

        "The real question for you is whether you were aware that the bankruptcy was filed in time to object to the discharge. If, by any means whatsoever, you were aware that the the bankruptcy was filed, in time to file an objection, then you are likely to be discharged. If this debt is large enough, consult a bankruptcy attorney and review the facts in close detail. Remember, it's your knowledge that's the most important factor here.

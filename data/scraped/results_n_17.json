    "title": "Can a credit union offset a direct deposit that comes in AFTER you declare bankruptcy?",
    "question": "I have moved the funds from my credit union to a new bank, and my SSDI check already goes to the new account. I’m going to have to declare bankruptcy. My long term disability insurance company suspended my benefits arbitrarily (one reason I can’t pay my bills) and I’m appealing. I’ve given them my new routing and account numbers, but if they resume payments and accidentally send my direct deposit to my old CU, can the CU use it to offset my credit card balance, even after I’ve declared bankruptcy? I sent a certified letter directing the CU to close my account, but they haven’t. Thanks!",

        "No. And I do not agree its an offset as the deposit was made post petition. Stop future deposits if needed with them to avoid this in the future. Good luck.",
        "May I suggest you get in your car and go down to your local branch of the Credit Union and close the account in person. That way you do not have to worry about it. Further, I depart from my colleagues as this may NOT be a violation of the automatic stay as you, in theory, are giving the credit union money and they are not taking any actions to collect, and just an offset. Consult with an attorney.",

        "there are some special rule for credit unions but what you are describing would still be a breach of the the automatic stay.",
        "No. That would violate the automatic stay if they did.",
        "Credit Unions have special rules. If you have a line of credit or other debt owed to the same credit union that you have your checking or savings with then the credit union could take the money from that deposit account even after bankruptcy is filed. Whether they should have or not is a different issue, however, credit unions have done these things before to other people inside a bankruptcy. There are actions you can take prior to filing bankruptcy to prevent this or avoid this from happening.\n\nI strongly suggest you consult with a bankruptcy attorney to explore your options prior to filing bankruptcy."

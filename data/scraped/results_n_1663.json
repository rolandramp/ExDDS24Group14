    "title": "Can a small credit union freeze my account because of an unpaid loan from 2009?",
    "question": "I had a loan from a small credit union that I modified and got a second on. After awhile I wasn't able to pay on both the 1st and 2nd. So in 2009 I couldn't make payments on the 2nd and the credit union did a charge-off in the amount of 118,000 and handed the unpaid case to a debt collecting agency who took over. I continued paying on the first loan and have a savings account with them for the last 6 years. Fast forward to last week and I needed a letter from them explaining the charge-off occurred. The Vice President of credit union wrote a letter saying that I still owe the money AND she locked my savings account w/o warning. I am in desperate need for my money and I'd like to know 1) do I owe them if it's already been handled by collection? 2) can the VP legally lock my acct?",

        "Every credit union has the right to do this under a provision of federal law that allows for the creation of credit unions.

        "Yes, you still do owe the debt. A \"charge-off\" by the creditor is not forgiveness of the debt or any portion of the debt, and the debt still exists. The charge-off is an accounting action by the creditor, so that it can write off a delinquent debt as a loss. Unless the credit union sold the debt to a debt buyer, you still owe the debt to the credit union.\n\nThe \"locking\" (aka \"freezing\") of your account is another issue, that may be authorized by the promissory note, contract or loan agreement that you signed. Generally, when credit unions make loans, the loan agreements contain language that states that the credit union has the right to \"offset\" delinquent loans with the funds held in the debtor's other accounts. This is a common occurrence with credit unions, when the customer has another account (i.e. a checking or savings account) and continues to deposit money in the account. However, certain procedures must be followed in order for the offset to comply with federal law, specifically the Truth In Lending Act, 15 U.S.C. ยง 1666h(a) and 12 CFR 226.12(d).\n\nIf you want to try and protect the funds that are being held, discuss your situation with a local bankruptcy attorney.",
        "It's not uncommon for a credit union to setoff funds in an account for a defaulted debt. Even if the debt has been charged off does not mean that you still don't owe the credit union. A charge off is merely term used for tax purposes that means the debt is no longer being carried on their books as good debt. You still owe it, and the credit union may utilize a collection agency to collect on it. The collection agency may not own the debt but may be collecting on the credit union's behalf. Therefore, the debt may still be with the credit union. Also, in the documents you signed when you joined the credit union, usually gives them the right to setoff debts against any funds in the account. Now you may have certain rights against the setoff if the funds you have in the account are exempt from such action.

        "Your credit union agreement probably gave the credit union the \"banker's right to set off.\" In other words, the credit union is permitted to raid your savings to apply the money to the defaulted loan. As the other attorneys explained the debt in collection does not preclude the credit union from still attempting to make itself whole.",

You might benefit if an attorney reviews all of the relevant documents and facts.",

        "A legal separation really serves no purpose other than if you are trying to extend medical benefits or for religious concerns. In my thirty-year plus career every legal separation I have accomplished for clients, they have then come back and paid me once again to do the dissolution. You really want to carefully think about this.",
        "The process is identical to a divorce. The outcome is the same, except that you will remain married and, therefore, eligible to be named beneficiaries of each other's health insurance. (And ineligible to remarry.)\n\nHere is a good starting point to learning about the process: http://www.scscourt.org/self_help/family/process.shtml\n\nPlease consider consulting with an experienced local family law attorney for any further guidance. You may not need to retain counsel, but it would be a good idea to have someone that you could bounce ideas off of and get feedback and guidance from.",
        "You can file the petition for legal separation and then immediately ask the court to grant a judgment on the separation of the assets and debts of the estate."

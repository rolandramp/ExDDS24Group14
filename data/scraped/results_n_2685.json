    "title": "I have uncollectable money judgment by debtor/husband. In state of California, can I put a lien on his wife's property?",
    "question": "The debtor is the spouse. The San Francisco primary residence is deeded on wife's name and daughter now .According to public records, he quit claim on title in 2003 but he lives there. Will common property rule still applies in this situation? Will the Assessor-Recorder Office accept the abstract judgment to put a lien on the family's real estate property? Parcel information on public records show history of lien notices and release of liens in the previous years. The debtor is a contractor.",

        "I concur with my colleague's comments. To elaborate however, by recording an Abstract of Judgment, that places a blanket (general ) lien on any real property being held in the name of the debtor (alone or jointly with others) in the county where that Abstract is recorded. But that will probably not attach to the wife's property as title is not being held in the debtor's name.\n\nHowever, that may not be the end of the road. When was the debt incurred? Under what circumstance? Is there room to argue that the debt is a community property debt? Can the judgment therefore be extended to the wife? These and other questions are best asked of an experienced attorney who can guide you. It is possible that the husband and wife are playing games including divestment of the husband's assets to throw off creditors. This would need to be investigated and there are tools available to creditors to do so. It may be a longer road then you anticipated taking, but it may ultimately be worthwhile. Good luck.",
        "You need an attorney to do what you want to do. You cannot just record a piece of paper. The court may issue an Abstract of Judgment, and you can record it, but that will not affect the new wife's title to her home. Merely living in the property does not give your ex any ownership interest.\n\nIf there were community efforts or community funds which were used to pay for or maintain the property, one-half would be community, and it might be possible to reach those assets. Providing, of course, that there was not a prior renuptial agreement affecting title to the property."

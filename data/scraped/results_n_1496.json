        "Absent a very strong case of fraud, or your holding enforceable lien rights/security interests in the defaulting company's AR or inventory, unfortunately you will need to obtain a judgment against the business owner entity before you can execute against any remaining assets, or otherwise try to trace assets to other companies and property held by the business owner. A competent business litigation attorney should be able to direct you in this matter. But remember that litigation is a very expensive proposition and recovery of your litigation fees and costs is going to be problematic.",

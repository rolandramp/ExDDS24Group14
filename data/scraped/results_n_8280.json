        "Yes, it is legally possible to toll the statute of limitations on a civil case based upon the same facts being litigated in a criminal case. The parties would have to enter into a tolling agreement that is well written and not vulnerable to attack in 16 years.\n\nThe real question, however, is whether the parties would be willing to wait so long. The practical consideration is that the evidence (particularly witness testimony) becomes less reliable over time.\n\nIf the parties are not willing to enter into a tolling agreement, a civil lawsuit could still be filed to preserve the statute of limitations, with a stipulation filed to stay the civil case pending resolution of the criminal case. A judge would have to agree to such stipulation and make it an order though.",
        "It's possible, but it's very unlikely that with the speedy trial requirement of a criminal case, one would be litigated for 16 years.\n\nYou need a lawyer to review the case documents at issue, and you need to do this quickly if you're in danger of letting your civil statute of limitations expire. Realize that a tolling of a statute is a response to a defense, and just something else to litigate.\n\nDisclaimer: Please note that this answer does not constitute legal advice, and should not be relied on, since each state has different laws, each situation is fact specific, and it is impossible to evaluate a legal problem without a comprehensive consultation and review of all the facts and documents at issue.

        "There are many things that can be done to toll a statute of limitations period. For instance, one tolling statute permits leaving the state to toll the period, until the person returns. Regarding debts, making a payment or a written promise to pay, has an effect of tolling the period. Filing and maintaining a civil lawsuit, can also do this, but if the case is dismissed, then the tolling ends, unless you have a written agreement to toll the period."

    "title": "I live in CA and make around $100K but invested $60K into company with personal credit and FTC shut them down. Bankruptcy?",
    "question": "I now have over $60,000 in personal credit cards due to my investing in a company that I would be making commissions and the FTC just shut them down. So after all my bills are paid, I have $62 left without food. So I'm in the red. I do make almost $100K, but with this new debt, I cannot see how I can last too long without getting behind. I have a car i purchased in July of 2016. What can I do? Do I try to file bankruptcy? I don't even have any money to do that at this point. All my credit cards are about maxed out. I am very worried.",

        "Whether you would automatically qualify for Chapter 7 depends upon a number of factors: can you prove that the credit card debt was incurred for the business, how much of it was incurred for the business, what are the types and amounts of your other debts, do you have dependents living with you, do you pay child or spousal support. You should sit down with an experienced bankruptcy attorney to go other these and many other issues to get a better understanding of your options.",
        "You may not qualify for a chapter 7 under the means test, but that isn't a certain thing, depending upon your secured debt and other necessary expenses. If you don't, you will more than likely be able to file a chapter 13 and deal with the debt that way.",

    "title": "As the executor of an estate, how will unpaid tax liens and foreclosure of the decedents home effect me?",
    "question": "I am the executor of my late mother's estate and just discovered unpaid income taxes, which has resulted in a lien on the estate. I was in the process of selling her home, but have learned that due to the lien, I will now owe money in order to close the sale. There is no money left in the estate to pay the lien, cover closing costs or to continue paying mortgage bills, and I am afraid that the home may go into foreclosure. At this point, I am tempted to walk away from the home and the lien, since what I have inherited is a lot of debt and headache. As the executor of the estate, how will the unpaid lien and potential foreclosure effect my credit, if at all?",

        "You do not owe any money. Your mother's estate owes money.\n\nIt sounds like you can either walk away, or if you want to do the most honorable thing possible, work with the lender on a short sale. If you don't want to put in the time for a short sale, the lender may be willing to have you deed the property to them.\n\nYou don't say if your mother had a trust or will. If trust, deeding the property to the lender will be straightforward. If a will, you should get court approval.\n\nGood luck!\n\nwww.michielawfirm.com\nI guess I wouldn’t feel lawyerly unless I wrote a disclaimer to this answer – after all, that’s what we lawyers are trained to do. So here it is. Disclaimer: Trying to provide a complete answer to a brief question without meeting the questioner and without getting all the facts is much like internet dating. Despite what you have been told by the person you’ve met online (and don’t they always put everything in the best light for themselves), once you meet them face to face you realize how much has been left out. People tend to bend the facts and there is always the other side to the story. So, this answer is about as valuable as the price that was paid for it. It should not be considered legal advice. It is meant as a general overview of how the law could apply to a very broad set of facts that may not have any applicability to the actual circumstances of the person making the question. It is hoped to provide some understanding of the broad field of law that could come into play. No attorney-client relationship has been formed with the questioner and no attorney client relationship was ever anticipated by my response to this question. I would also like to remind you that I am only licensed in the State of California, and the answer provided is based upon my knowledge of California law.",

        "As the executor, you have a duty t maximize the value fot he estate for the beneficiaries, if the estate is \"upside down\" dues to these liens and debts, there may be nothing you can do to preserve the estate's value. Your best options may be to negotiate a short sale with your buyer and the lender for an amount that covers the debts, or offer a Deed in Lieu to the lender if the amount of the sale you were contracting for and that the lender approved doesn't cover the debts.\n\nNo, if the lender forecloses on the mortgage it won't affect your personal credit, which has nothing to do with your acts in your capacity as executor of this estate.\n\nDisclaimer: Please note that this answer does not constitute legal advice, and should not be relied on, since each state has different laws, each situation is fact specific, and it is impossible to evaluate a legal problem without a comprehensive consultation and review of all the facts and documents at issue.

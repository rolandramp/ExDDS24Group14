    "title": "Mother's debt will exceed her assets. How does sole heir handle the bills? Should I even proceed with obtaining her assets?",
    "question": "My mother died as a result of her injuries sustained in a house fire. Her estate consisted of $6000 in her bank account and an insured value of $5000 for her car, also lost in the fire. She was unemployed, unmarried, did not own a home and did not have medical insurance. She had $800 in credit card debt. She had no will. I am her only child and the point of contact for the hospitals and ambulance services that treated her. I have learned through legal counsel that I will not be responsible for any of her debt beyond the value of her estate. What do I do when the bills come in?",

        "I agree with Mr. Tigerman. You will need to proceed with Summary Administration under Probate Code section 13100, since your mother's estate is valued less than $100,000. You can find the proper forms on your local Superior Court's website, or at the following link under \"Probate - Decedents Estates\":\n\nhttp://www.courtinfo.ca.gov/forms/\n\nThis answer, and any other answer on this website, does not constitute legal advice and does not establish an attorney-client relationship. You should consult a local attorney for any questions or concerns regarding your specific situation.",
        "I assume you have not yet taken control of the bank account or obtained the insurance proceeds. If you have, stop reading here. You can prepare a declaration under Probate Code section 13100 which you can present to the bank and insurance company. You then can reimburse yourself your out of pocket for expenses of the last illness and funeral and pay the balance if any. If the credit card debt is the only remaining debt you can pay what ever balance you have on hand.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The response herein is not legal advice and does not create an attorney/client relationship or any right of confidentiality between you and the responding attorney.

This answer is not a substitute for competent legal advice from a licensed attorney that practices in the subject area in your jurisdiction and who is familiar with your specific facts and all of the circumstances",
        "I am so sorry about your mother, what a tragedy. When the bills come in, make a list of all of them. Include medical bills, funeral expenses, credit cards and other debts, legal bills, everything. Each state typically has a list of priorities for creditors. Typically expenses related to the administration get a high priority (hiring a lawyer to deal with the estate, etc.), final medical expenses are near the top of the priority list, and credit cards and other bills come after that. Once you know what you're dealing with, you can pay off the bills for the highest priority creditors first (including you, if you paid for burial and funeral) and call or write the others to let them know that your mother passed away and she has no money left in her estate.\n\nAll the best to you,\n\n~Catherine\n\nI hope this helps.

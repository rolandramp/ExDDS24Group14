        "No. If the reason you are seeking to set aside the default and vacate default judgment is because you were never served with the summons, then the basis for your motion is Code of Civil Procedure section 473.5, not section 473(b).\n\nIn California, a defendant who has been defaulted by failure to respond to a summons and complaint might have an opportunity to set aside the default based upon Code of Civil Procedure § 473.5.\n\n“When service of a summons has not resulted in actual notice to a party in time to defend the action and a default or default judgment has been entered against him or her in the action, he or she may serve and file a notice of motion to set aside the default or default judgment and for leave to defend the action.” (California Code of Civil Procedure § 473.5(a). )\n\nThe motion must be served within the earlier of two years after entry of a default judgment against him or her; or 180 days after service on him or her of a written notice that the default or default judgment has been entered.\n\nThe moving party should submit a sworn declaration as to when he or she first learned of this action, whether he or she was ever served with the summons or complaint in the action, and whether he or she ever received notice of entry of default.\n\n“A notice of motion to set aside a default or default judgment and for leave to defend the action shall designate as the time for making the motion a date prescribed by subdivision (b) of Section 1005, and it shall be accompanied by an affidavit showing under oath that the party's lack of actual notice in time to defend the action was not caused by his or her avoidance of service or inexcusable neglect. The party shall serve and file with the notice a copy of the answer, motion, or other pleading proposed to be filed in the action.” (California Code of Civil Procedure § 473.5(b).)",
        "The beginning you have set forth seems reasonably okay. But keep in mind you will need (1) notice of motion and motion, and (2) declaration(s) in support of your motion, as well as the memorandum of points and authorities. You will not prevail under CCP 473(b) unless your declaration contains explicit facts demonstrating mistake, inadvertence or excusable neglect. In addition, your memorandum of points and authorities should cite and discuss case law which supports your proposition that the facts you recite in the declaration constitute mistake, inadvertence or excusable neglect. There are California cases which separately discuss each of these three factors."

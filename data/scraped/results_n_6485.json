        "Unfortunately the \"undue hardship\" requirement to get student loans discharge is extremely difficult to meet unless you have some serious issues like (being involved in a car accident that left you with permanent brain injuries, being a senior with only social security as your income) and even in those situations expect to have a trial. For people drowning in student loan debt, particuarly private student loans (federal has some repayment options like \"Income Based Repayment\" and \"Income Contingent Repayment) there are very limited options other than pay or pray that the statute of limitation expires and the creditor fails to file a lawsuit before that happens. As far as bankruptcy goes, at current time, we only have the option to file for chapter 13, which would force a certain repayment schedule on your creditors (the amount of your chapter 13 payment would be dictated by bankrutpcy rules) not voluntary arrangement with loan creditors. Don't know if this would help. You'd have to meet with a bankrutpcy attorney to discuss details. There are several bills that have been proposed to deal with the growing student loan crisis, but have very little traction in Congress other than support of some Democrats. It would be nice if you attempted to contact your representative and ask them to support these bills so that you along with millions of others in default can get some relief. In my personal opinion, we're not likely to see much of an economic recovery in this country if several generations are losing a large percentage of their wages in making student loan payments. But, I'm digressing. This issue is dear and near my heart and I sympathise as no doubt many attorneys who attended school in the last two decades are also struggling with massive student loans. The only positive thing I can say about private loans is that wage garnishments are capped in California so if/when the creditor sues they will only be able to take a precentage of your wages. Please see H.R. 2028 & H.R. 4170 for more information and groups like www.forgivestudentloandebt.com.",

        "Your question is difficult to understand. You appear to be asking if a final property settlement for $27000 plus 1/2 of your ex's retirement can be discharged in his bankruptcy and if not how to enforce the settlement.\nSpousal/Family support is not dischargeable. Property divisions payments may be. Much depends upon the wording of the property settlement and type of bankruptcy, You should take your final property settlement agreement to an experienced bankruptcy attorney and discuss the issues with the attorney.\nThis forum is not set up for such intricate questions, and you need to discuss it with someone asap.",
        "Your misuse of legal terminology you clearly don't understand is your first problem. You are a creditor in the bankruptcy, and creditor's issues do not involve issues of anything known as being \"exempt.\" A better use of the Avvo site is to explain your concern in ordinary English.\nWhile your ex-spouse cannot eliminate debts owed to you in a Chapter 7, divorce debts relating to division of property rights (or obligation to pay debts) can absolutely be eliminated in Chapter 13. You ought to be meeting with a creditor's rights attorney as soon as you receive a notice that a bankruptcy has been filed. Expect to pay plenty for this representation. The exact wording of the divorce paperwork will likely be the controlling factor as to whether you lose everything given to you in the divorce. Too late to change that now.\nHope this perspective helps!",

        "What you are describing is a fairly common occurrence. Debt buyers file lawsuits and file proofs of service which reflect that the defendant was \"served\" with the summons and complaint by personal or substitute service, but from my experience, the proofs of service are often not accurate (i.e., the process server may have passed by your house, or maybe your former house, and dropped a copy of the summons and complaint on the doorstep).\n\nNot knowing about the suit, the defendant does not answer or take any action. Then the plaintiff proceeds to get a default judgment. From there, the creditor can take your assets including funds held in bank accounts.\n\nThe primary method for \"fighting back\" in this situation is to file a motion to set aside the judgment. You may have to hire an attorney to handle this. The attorney gets information from you, and usually a declaration of some kind, and submits the motion.

        "My colleagues are correct, this happens, and it happens a lot. Most often it is not the collection attorney but a dishonest process server.\n\nThe question is, what can you do about it?

If you feel you want to dispute the debt, then pull up the file (often in another state) and take a look at the proof of service.

        "I see this happen to many people with too much regularity.

    "title": "How do I respond to a Collections Rule 3.740 Limited (09) subpoena for my parents who both suffer from dementia?",
    "question": "My sisters and I have recently taken over financial control for our parents who both suffer from dementia and are in failing health. They are being sued by AMEX and have just been served. Their only income is Social Security and their only asset is their home, and they cannot afford a lawyer. How should we respond?",
    "answers": [
        "You may want to start by contacting an elder law attorney, to ask about filing a case to ask that a court appoint a conservator, someone who can handle their affairs, if they are no longer mentally or physically capable. However, its possible that one of both of them are competent to appoint a representative. In that case a Power of Attorney can be used to appoint one person to handle their financial and legal matters. With a Power of Attorney the representative might be able file an answer to the complaint and then negotiate a settlement. (Contact a debt collection defense attorney if that's your objective.) If there's no money available to resolve the debt, you'd need to look at other options, such as bankruptcy.",
        "I agree with Mr. Bayer, and would only suggest that you could also contact the creditors to negotiate a payment plan of some sort.\n\nOn a related matter, when you say that you've taken control of your parents' finances, do you mean that you have file a Conservatorship? Because if you haven't, then you may be setting yourself up for legal trouble worse than this AmEx bill.",
        "I get the fact that funds are limited and they don't have money to pay a lawyer. They don't have money to pay the debt, and they don't have money to pay a lawyer to help them. So how are supposed to fix this for you?\n\nYou should go see a bankruptcy lawyer, or two and discuss their financial situation. Not necessarily because they should file bankruptcy, but because BK lawyers are trained to know what if any are the options for your parents. And, most BK lawyers do not charge for a consultation. The cost of inaction can be far more expensive that the cost of a lawyer."

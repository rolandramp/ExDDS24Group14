        "All creditors can appear and ask questions regarding the nature and location of assets, the petition, schedules, and the statement of financial affairs. Creditors can be limited as to time, but the meeting can be continued if necessary. A pending civil lawsuit has no impact on the 341a meeting, however, this is not a place to conduct discovery into that particular claim.",
        "They CAN object if the questions are lingering and it would be better for an extended exam. The meeting of creditors is available for creditors to ask questions of the debtor(s). The questions would center on whether the debtor has been truthful in their schedules. The issues the creditor would want to address is if there are assets missing from the schedules or income missing. If you just dont like that you are being discharged be specific about why it should not be discharged. Did the debtor commit some kind of fraud? To be specific, fraud does not mean they agreed to pay the debt and did not pay it. Fraud means they gave you false financial information such as their income was wildly exaggerated.",
        "Short answer: sure, your lawyer can object. Just as anyone can sue anyone for anything at any time. The real question is will the objection be successful? The answer to that is no. The 341 meeting is called \"meeting of creditors\" and it is specifically held so that creditors and the trustee can ask questions. Usually the trustee asks most, if not all, of the questions, but creditors can attend and can ask questions regardless of whether the debtor does not want to answer their questions.",
        "To your question, \"can he attorney for the debt at the trustee meeting of creditors object to one creditor being there and asking questions?\" The answer is Yes, the attorney can object, but there is no one at the meeting of creditors to rule on the objection because there is no judge there. If there was, the objection would likely be overruled. As others have stated, the purpose of the meeting of creditors is to allow creditors to ask questions.\n\nIf the creditor is taking too long or if the questions to not deal with the in formation in the schedules or SOFA, the debtor's attorney can suggest that the questions have strayed outside the scope of the ยง 341 hearing. The trustee will agree if that is the case and advise the attorney for the creditor that a 2004 examination can be scheduled.",
        "The 341 meeting only allows a limited amount of time for creditor to participate, as the trustee's calendar is usually quite full. A creditor's objective ought to be to obtain information under oath from debtors, not to engage in abusive demands in violation of the automatic stay. If more information is needed, a creditor can schedule a 2004 examination. Hope this perspective helps.",
        "The purpose of a meeting of creditors is to ask questions of the debtor and to confirm the correctness of any information. Many creditors ask questions at a hearing and file a motion after the hearing, but there is nothing wrong with the creditor appearing and asking questions at the hearing if he has already filed a motion.",
        "The purpose of the meeting, in part, is to allow creditors to ask questions. What is the logic in believing a creditor can't appear and ask questions because they are taking actions a creditor might take?"

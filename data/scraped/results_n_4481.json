        "You don't appear to know who has sued you, or for what, and in what amount. DO NOT let the creditor obtain a default judgment against you! Get down to the court and take a look at the file there. Then take copies of the file documents, as well as a copy of the \"docket\" from the court, to a local attorney ASAP. Good luck.",
        "You need to actually go to the courthouse and look at the court's file. If there is a Proof of Service, stating that you were served, get a copy. Also, a copy of the Complaint. Then, consult an attorney who is experienced in defending debt collection cases.\n\nYou cannot wait until 2016 to take care of this. If the collector obtains a default judgment against you, which they may do at any time, the judgment will be entered and final, and future dates will go off calenar.",

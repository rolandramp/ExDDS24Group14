    "title": "Does cease and desist letter to 3 credit bureaus clear debt records? would my credit score be repaired again? what about LOC?",
    "question": "If my debt is 4 1/2 yrs old (which is over the CA statue of limitations), and I send the cease and desist letter to the 3 credit reporting bureaus, would my debt records be cleared? and would I be free of debts? My credit score is ruined right now, but once this is taken care of, would my credit score be repaired again as long as I make my current payments on time or do I need to do something to restore my credit score?",
    "answers": [
        "The rules that the credit bureaus must follow are set under federal law. They report your credit history without indicating whether or not a debt is collectable or not. California state law is irrelevant to your credit report.\n\nSo your plan to repair your credit by sending the credit bureaus a \"cease & desist\" letter is not going to be an effective tool to help you. Whoever thought up this scheme was either trying to sell you a \"pig in a poke\" or came up with this plan after a late night in a bar.\n\nHope this perspective helps!",
        "There is no such thing as a cease and desist letter to a Credit Reporting Agency (that is not recognized under the Fair Credit Reporting Act and they can ignore the letter.) bad credit history entries generally last 7 years on the credit report. The passing of the statute of limitations does not extinguish the debt, which can continue to be reported. make sure you do not do something that starts the clock running again for the SOL.",
        "Many people confuse the statute of limitations (SOL), which is the time a creditor or debt collector has to file a lawsuit in court for an unpaid debt, with the period of obsolescence for credit reporting purposes, which can be 7.5 years for a collection account. Thus, the fact that your debt may be unenforceable in court at the present time does not mean that the creditor or debt collector cannot report it on your credit reports for a few more years, depending on date of default. The rules to compute the SOL (which is based on state law) with the credit reporting obsolescence date (which is based on federal law, the Fair Credit Reporting Act) are different. Court judgments can be reported even longer, if unpaid.\n\nPlease see my web site, which has free letters (letter 3.1 to 3.3) that you can use to dispute errors on your credit report, including a letter to dispute debts that are obsolete for credit reporting purposes.

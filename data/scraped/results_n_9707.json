        "When you file for bankruptcy you are required to list ALL of your debts and obligations. That does not mean ALL of them will be discharged. For example, student loans will not be discharged. That also does not mean that after the bankruptcy is complete you cannot choose to pay one or more of your debtors back, like a doctor.\n\nJudgments are dischargeable in Bankruptcy, unless for fraud in which it may or may not be dischargeable.\n\nAs stated by the prior attorney, you do not want the judgment to become a lien on real property.\n\nI strongly suggest you meet with a local bankruptcy attorney to assist you in filing for bankruptcy.\n\nDisclaimer. The information posted above is for general information, does not constitute professional legal advice, and does not create an attorney client relationship",
        "First of all, you do not pick and choose which debts you include in your bankruptcy. They are all included. You have to list them all. But if you want, you can still pay a debt even though it was discharged in bankruptcy.\n\nNow the answer to your question: Yes judgements are discharged in bankrutpcy.\n\nBut a judgement may become a lien on your property. This is called a Judicial Lien. In this case you need to take the additional step of Avoiding the Lien."

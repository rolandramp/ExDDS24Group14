        "The best approach is to lay low and wait. Do not contact the collection agency or the provider. Do not send them any money, or ask for any type of repayment plan. If a lawsuit is filed, you will then need to contact a local San Diego Attorney to discuss options.",

        "An SOL defense is only asserted WHEN YOU ARE SUED. The SOL defense does not stop the creditor from reporting to the CRAs and does not prevent the creditor from taking other reasonable attempts to get you to pay. Not sure what you are looking to hear other than how to deal with litigation. Hope this perspective helps!"

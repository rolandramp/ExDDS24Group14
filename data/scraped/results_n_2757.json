    "title": "Debts for traffic tickets in Collection Agency \"AllianceOne\". To whom i should pay?",
    "question": "In 2007 i received 3 citations. I had a temporary drivers license at that time. Those citations were received for riding on a pedicab in a restricted zone. I never paid the fines. I started to search the information about how to pay the fines. I was able to know that the fines went to the collection agency \"AllianceOne\". Some people told me that i can pay fines directly to the court of San Diego. But some other people telling that the collection agency BOUGHT my debts and now it is between me and the collection agency.",

        "I read your comment to Mr. Concidine's very helpful and good answer. It seems like there is nothing for you to pay or do. Why are these dismissed citations an issue now? It appears there is no obligation to pay anything.",
        "If you went to court and plead guilty and didn't pay the fines, the only way to resolve the citations is pay them through Alliance One. The phone number for Alliance One is (877)541-8420 or website www.payaoi.com. The court refers old unpaid citations to Alliance One....if you never went to court on the underlying charges you can still contest those charges to try to get the fines reduced prior to paying.",
        "Why not just contact Alliance One and ask?",
        "P.S. You probably don't have a driver's license either. Very good chance your license is suspended as well."

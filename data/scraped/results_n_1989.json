    "title": "Re moral character determination in CA, it appears I may be invited to an informal hearing. Do I need to hire a CA lawyer now?",
    "question": "I submitted an application for determination of moral character in CA. I knew the only red flag in my file was poor credit and outstanding debt that was in some cases 5+ years old and charged off (including two civil judgments from creditors). My analyst corresponded with me asking for additional information regarding my outstanding debts and how I planned to address them. I was able to secure funds from a friend to resolve all outstanding debt and judgments. I disclosed the source of the funds and the promissory note to my State Bar analyst.",

        "I recommend that you engage skilled and experienced counsel for advice and strategic analysis well before you are faced with an appearance before the Committee. There is no such thing as too informed or too prepared in this very critical event, and objective experienced guidance can change your course or affirm your plans. Either way you have benefit. It is seldom necessary or wise to be \"lawyered up\" for the appearance unless there is a determinative and overarching complex legal issue -- that does not seem the case here. I am fairly optimistic for you. Meet with a good lawyer and move forward with this matter in the mind set that you are making progress.",
        "Congratulations on passing the bar exam. This is and of itself demonstrates discipline and ability to handle your own affairs. Your debts indicate a different pattern or history however, and the State Bar is concerned that money troubles you had or continue to have would jeopardize your ability to for example, hold money in trust on behalf of a client. You will possibly be invited to hearing, where you may be allowed to move forward, or be held back - it is CRUCIAL you obtain counsel to advise you on how to handle yourself should you be invited to a Subcommittee hearing because you will be scrutinized VERY closely.",
        "Yes you do. I've been there done that. We can't solicit on this site. But use Avvo to find the attorney you need, click on attorney's profiles . To help you get admitted to practice. Best of luck.",
        "While Ms McCall is an excellent I'm not sure that she handles state bar matter. It is quite a specialty and there is only a handful of attorneys with significant experience with state bar matter. Here is a link you can follow.\n\nhttp://www.disciplinedefensecounsel.org/\n\nI would strongly recommend Ephraim Margolin from the list.\n\nGood luck and I hope you find this helpful.",
        "I think you know the answer. Are you hoping to one day be admitted to the Bar? YES, YES, YES, you need an attorney and you needed one yesterday! I'll edit the practice area to administrative law to attack the attention of one of the best, Ms. Christine McCall. Good luck to you. Retain counsel at once!"

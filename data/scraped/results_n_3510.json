    "title": "Can 120-day wait/challenge period on receiving inheritance from irrevocable trust be legally waived? If so, how?",
    "question": "I'm beneficiary under an irrevocable trust. I am to sign documents that, as I understand the language, waive all rights to anything other than receiving the amount stated in the trust. I am fine with that. I could use the inheritance now, but was told I must still wait 120 days after signing, when I thought I had already waived rights to pursue any legal action against the trust. Is there any instrument that, if signed and notarized, would waive the 120 days challenge period so I could get my money sooner than the 120 days minimum?",

        "It would be imprudent for the trustee to make the distribution if he or she has not gathered all assets, determined all debts that need to be paid, including taxes, and paid those debts and taxes. Remember if you distribute before everything is paid the trust estate creditors will look to the trustee. Were I to represent the trustee I would tell him to move quickly to gather assets and determine tax liability and just debts, but stand firm against beneficiaries who all of a sudden cannot wait for assets they wouldn't be recieving had the Trustor not died. and since no one can say with precision when a Trustor will die they really do not have a ligitimate expectation of being paid early.",
        "I agree with Mr. Broiles. However, if there is more than one beneficiary and depending on the terms of trust., it may be prudent for the trustee to wait until ALL beneficiaries sign a waiver. You cannot speed up the process and you should be prepared to wait longer if you are not the sole beneficiary.",
        "In our office, we typically advise trustee clients that they are safe to distribute early if every beneficiary has waived the 120 day challenge period. The 120 days runs from the date you're provided with a copy of the trust, not the date that you sign.\n\nSee California Probate Code 16060 and following for more about this."

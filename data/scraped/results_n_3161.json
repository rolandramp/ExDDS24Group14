        "You need to dispute the debt by sending a written dispute to each of the credit reporting agencies which is reporting the debt. Each reporting credit reporting agency will ask the \"furnisher\" of the information to investigate the account. If the furnisher does not respond, the account will be removed from your credit. However, a dismissal without prejudice does not mean that you do not owe the debt and that they cannot continue to attempt to collect it.",
        "Even the dismissal will stay on your credit report for 7 years. Look closely, if it was dismissed and still shows \"balance due\" you should contact credit reporting company in writing to have removed or changed to 0 balance due. Send order of dismissal. This is important because your debt to income ratio is what is primarily reviewed by future credit applications.",
        "No it is true that the case was filed, but then dismissed. Plus I am guessing that the dismissal was \"without prejudice,\" meaning that they could refile later on. The dismissal entry will tell the story. But I do not see this as inaccurate information."

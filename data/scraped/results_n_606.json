        "Atty Hill is correct. We are missing some important facts. Missing your first meeting does not result in your case being dismissed unless you have failed in other parts of your case, like missing payments, etc. That said, refiling your case should not cost you double because all the creditor information and other schedules won't be changing that much. You will have to pay another filing fee of $310. If you are a multiple filer, your lawyer may need to file additional documents to reinstate the automatic stay.",
        "In the EDCA you have to do more (or maybe less) than just miss the initially scheduled 341 meeting to have your case dismissed.\nIf your case is dismissed once within the year, it's possible you need a motion to extend the automatic stay, as the stay only lasts 30 days in the second by. I'd dismissed 2x or more, you have to file a motion to have a stay instituted on the creditors. All of that would explain the extra cost, and you don't have that motion.\nIn addition you need to update your schedules and means test.\nSo, yes you can represent yourself, but it's not recommended."

    "title": "Do I need to hire forensic accountant/actuary in an uncontested divorce?",
    "question": "In an uncontested divorce in California, lets say if we agreed on everything, including all property divisions. It will be an unequal division. Wife will get the house, and I will keep my 401Ks and IRAs and she will keep her IRAs. Does the law requires that we have to disclose in detail which portion of each property (house, 401K, etc.) is separate and which is community (which would necessitate hiring forensic accountant)? or is it enough just to list all the properties with their values in the disclosure?",

        "You will only require a forensic accountant if you both cannot agree on the division of assets and debts. Forensic accountants can be helpful in contested proceedings in which tracing of sources of separate property commingled with community property is essential to resolve reimbursement issues between spouses.",
        "Forensics, such as forensic accountants, are hired when there is a disagreement about facts, or the facts are an open question. If the parties have fully disclosed everything and they agree as to the values of their assets and debts, then there is no need for a forensic accountant to answer the questions that no one has.",
        "No, you don't need to do that. You may value your own assets. Good job on keeping this out of court.",
        "No need to hire an accountant or actuary based upon the details you provided. Parties are free to agree on any division they choose, and as long as you are both in agreement on the values you provide and the final division, you do not need to disclose which portion of each asset is separate/community.",
        "If everything is amicable then no need to hire the auditor. Just an attorney who can review the agreement and assist in filing it..."

    "title": "Can a charged-off account purchased by junk debt buyer be sold back to initial creditor to file lawsuit & collect?",
    "question": "If a junk debt buyer is unable to collect on a charged-off account they purchased from a creditor, can that account then be sold or transferred back to the initial creditor they bought it from, and have the initial creditor sue and collect the money? Can a collection agency that was assigned by the initial creditor to collect, do this? Or is it not legal in the case of a charge off. Trying to get a better understanding of the process. Thanks in advance for any help",

    "title": "How do I stop my ex-husband's debt collectors from calling me for payment?",
    "question": "In 2005, my husband molested my daughter and I wanted to be divorced immediately. I had to wait for his juvenile and criminal cases to be settled before I could get my divorce. My ex omitted his credit card debt from the settlement so I didn't know about it. A year after he went into prison, cc collections started calling me for payment (more than $18K). I can't get them to stop. They say my name is also on the card. I hate credit cards and stopped using them altogether after he left my house. He is narcissistic and angry, vindictive, etc. He left me and the kids destitute... this isn't the only financial abuse he has committed towards me. Please help!!!",

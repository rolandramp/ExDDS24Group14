        "We would need a lot more facts to give you a precise answer. The fact that you say you own your home makes me think that chapter 7 is not an option unless you actually mean you have a home that's really the bank's because you still have a mortgage.\n\nGo see a good bankruptcy attorney to discuss your options or lack thereof with respect to bankruptcy.\n\nIn the alternative, your lender may be willing to negotiate the debt you'll still owe after voluntarily returning the motor home. Some creditors are willing to accept less than the amount you owe, but many factors are involved, and you should get good legal counsel on the benefits, consequences, and risks associated with going that route.\n\nThis is a very serious situation, but you may have several options.",

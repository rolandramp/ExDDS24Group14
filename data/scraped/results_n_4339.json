    "title": "Can I keep my house if I file bankruptcy? I am current in my payments.",
    "question": "I am swimming in debt and need to file bankruptcy but want and need to keep my house, I have a family of 5 and am only earner. I am considering Chapter 13 ( I feel awful) and would like to pay back something, but literally have no disposable income. I may have no choice but to file chapter 7. I have about $60,000(?) in equity in my house but the bank will only allow me to borrow up to 80% of my house value. Because I owe so much it would equate to less than $5000. (I owe $230,000 house worth about $290,000). I don't want to lose my house. My mortgage is fairly reasonable and I cant rent a house for less than what I am paying in mortgage. Can I exempt my house? Or will they take it away? I live in CA.",

        "California has two types of homestead exemption. One is the \"declared\" homestead exemption and one is the \"automatic\" homestead exemption. I second all attorneys who advise retaining counsel and note that, while my memory is not perfect, I think I have heard radio advertisements that say things like \"keep your house, stop garnishment, etc.\" Some of these advertisements may be misleading. Creditors can object to claimed exemptions, to the dischargeability of debts, and to allowing a debtor to obtain a general discharge. Because the California homestead exemptions are so favorable to debtors, creditors may give greater scrutiny to these claims than to other exemptions.",
        "If you qualify for CA exemptions, there's an available homestead exemption for a family, which is presently set at $100,000; the amount is subject to change. Salient factors to consider in the context of a homestead exemption are 1) costs of hypothetical sale (which diminish the actual equity); 2) a present escalating real estate bubble in CA, which is inflating equity; post-petition appreciation must be considered as part of the equity that must be protected; and 3) other assets that must be exempted. Application of the homestead exemption is nuanced.",
        "If you have lived in California for more than two years, you have a choice of two exemption laws available to you to protect your home. Like most California laws, these laws are complicated and you will want to have representation from an experienced bankruptcy attorney. Frankly, the method of valuing your house may be a lot more important in protecting your house than the exemption laws themselves. Hope this perspective helps!",
        "Homeowners who have equity in their homes generally use the CCP 704 exemptions. (You have to have lived in California for 2 years.) A homestead exemption is to exempt your home only -- you have to live in the home at the time of the bankruptcy. The exemption amounts are as follows:\n\n$75,000 if you are single with no dependents living with you\n$100,000 if you are married and your spouse lives with you, or at least one child or other family member that you support\n$175,000 if you or your spouse is age 65 or over; or if you are disabled\n\nSo under this set of exemptions, if have $60,000 in equity, all your equity will be exempt. That means that the trustee cannot take and sell your home to pay creditors. However, you may want to get an appraisal before going forward, just to make sure that the value is not more than your estimate of $290,000.\n\nThere are many good bankruptcy attorneys in the Bay Area and most of them provide free consultations,l so that you can get more information about the process and the cost to file.\n\nGood luck.",
        "Based on what you have stated in your question it seems likely that you can keep your house and file a Chapter 7 bankruptcy.

It is imperative that all the values on your assets are correct and that the right exemptions are taken in your bankruptcy. Get a good attorney and good luck.",
        "You have many \"moving parts\" in your situation. A simple \"Yes, you can keep your house\" or \"No, you can't\" is not possible here. As the prior answer said, you need to consult with a qualified bankruptcy attorney in your area to discuss your entire financial situation. That way would be able to determine what actions would results in what probable results.",
        "Chapter 7 is the most common type of bankruptcy and it sounds like that's what you need. The exemption laws govern what a person is allowed to retain when they file a chapter 7. The exemption laws include the homestead exemption which protects equity in your home but has monetary limits. For a family, the homestead is $100,000 but can be more under certain circumstances. To be sure you can file chapter 7 and retain everything you have requires that I ask you many questions. Here's a link to a blog post on exemptions that has more detail. Hope this helps.",
        "Whether you can exempt your assets, including the equity in your home, depends on your exact circumstances. However, if you take the most liberal exemption for homeowners you should be fine. However, I urge you to consult and retain a bankruptcy attorney. This is not a project you should attempt on your own. Whether you can file a 7, as opposed to a 13, will depend on facts you have not posted. Consult a local BK attorney. You will be glad you did. Good luck. -- Michael"

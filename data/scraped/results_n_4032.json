        "At this point you may just be in a waiting game. Do as the previous attorneys recommended and send letters to the original company explaining your willingness to pay off the account. This company may have sold this debt, maybe even a portfolio of debts, to a debt collector and that debt collector is legally obligated to contact you. However, the debt may not have been transferred to anyone and you may be in the clear (so to speak).",
        "I agree with the other attorney responding. Make one affirmative act to notify them of your willingness to pay and nothing more unless they contact you. If you personally guaranteed this debt, you may want to check your credit to ensure they are not reporting you for non-payment. If not, you may be able to wait this out and owe nothing once the statute of limitations for suit to be filed runs out.",
        "Send a letter to the business that you stand ready, willing and able to pay, as soon as its successor can provide you with evidence of its right to collect on the debt. If the letter comes back hold on to it. Then you just wait until you are contacted for repayment. If no one contacts you before the statute of limitations runs, then you are no longer obligated.",
        "Although the company is no longer doing business, it may still be an existing entity. If you were making payments, the business owner(s) should have provided you with a new address to send payments. If not, You can stop making payments and wait to see if you are contacted. If you hear nothing for afew months, you can likely assume no further payment is expected. At that time it would be a good idea to check your credit record to see if the debt has been reported. If so, you can find out the new address for payment and make contact. If the debt has not been reported, you have no need to continue trying to pay this off."

    "title": "How can I remove my name off of a car title as the legal registered owner?",
    "question": "I recently file for chapter 7 bankruptcy and it was discharged almost three months ago. My car loan was discharged. The car lender/ car lot has not made any efforts to retain procession of the vehicle. I have no interest in keeping the vehicle or remaining responsible for the vehicle. How do I legally relinquish all interest of the vehicle? I went to the DMV website but the only form that I see The lender has to fill it out. I am still the legal owner on record and I do not think that it is right that I should remain responsible and continue to insure, renew registration for a car that I do not want and was suppose to be picked up in January 2015.",

        "You cannot force a creditor to repossess an auto.\n\nWhen this happens to my clients, I advise them to keep the auto if it provides reliable transportation, but keep it insured and do not leave anything valuable in it, because at any time as the lender may finally decide to repossess the vehicle. Some of my clients have continued to use the vehicle for multiple years.\n\nIf my client's auto is not running. I advise them to send a certified letter, retaining a copy, to the the lender letting the lender know that the vehicle must be repossessed within 30 days and that if the vehicle is not repossessed in 30 days, the vehicle will be towed to a junkyard. The local junkyard will tow the vehicle but will not pay my client if he/she cannot produce a clear title, but this allows them to have the vehicle removed from their property."

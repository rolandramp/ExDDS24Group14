    "title": "I'm being sued for property damage from a car accident that happened in 2009?",
    "question": "I was in a car accident back in 2009. The other driver was drunk when he hit us but I was faulted for the accident because I was driving my friend's car that didn't have insurance. She was in the passenger seat because she was intoxicated and I didn't want her to drive. The guy see me for property damage in 2009 and the judge awarded him the amount he was suing for. At the time I wasn't working and I was on welfare so I wasn't able to pay him. Fast forward to March 2019. I was mailed a notice of renewal of judgement which they are now seeking twice the amount. I lost my job in the beginning of March and I'm currently looking for work. I'm scared, literally! I've never been so stressed in my life and I can't afford a lawyer. I've seeked programs to help pay my rent, asked family for help paying bills until I secure a job. What can I do?",

        "If they have a judgment against you, you can pay it, try to settle for the amount owed (They usually won't do more than waive some of the interest) or file bankruptcy. Bankruptcy is probably the best course. Find the money somehow.",
        "The time to defend against the lawsuit has long since passed. You can pay the balance, try to settle with them for less, or talk to a bankruptcy attorney. It seems given your situation the latter would be the best choice."

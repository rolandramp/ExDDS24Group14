        "To my colleague's answer, I would only add that this is not something that the police would likely pursue. Hopefully, you have closed this account and opened one in your name only. The best advice I can give you is do not ever, ever, ever, open a joint account with someone to whom you are not married, and even then don't do it if they have significant debts, no matter how old - any money in a joint account could potentially be taken to pay the other person's debt, and the other person has the ability to wipe out the account at any time.",
        "Glad it didn't happen. It's illegal to attempt to take money that doesn't belong to you, or to try to circumvent banking operations for unlawful gain. However, the fact pattern you provide does not describe an actionable claim, or even one that would exceed small claims filing fees were there facts to support a claim."

    "title": "I dissolved a corporation ten years ago in California. It had no debts. Is it possible to reopen it?",
    "question": "I would like to reopen my old corporation unless there are problems with that. I closed it 10 years ago. Does it keep the original incorporation date or is it a new one. Are there a lot of taxes and fees to pay to update it or does it start from now.",
    "answers": [
        "You have to file a new Articles of Incorporation with Secretary of State of California. It will have new incorporation date and new tax ID.",
        "You may reactivate your old corporation but you would have to pay the taxes for all the years it was inactive, at least $800.00 per year.\n\nYou may form a new corporation with the same name. It can look the same, do the same things, and have the same name, but it will be a different corporation with a different Secretary of State corporation number. It's not names but numbers that identify corporations, like a social security numbers for persons with the same name.",
        "You may be better off starting off from scratch. The old corpse would not add years to the new and if this was your reason, you may be in hot waters for touting the age of your revived company",
        "You also need to immediately see if you can secure the name of your former corp. as it may be taken by another corp."

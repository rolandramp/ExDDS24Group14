        "Stop the calls by asking them IN WRITING to stop. Send a cease and desist letter demanding that they communicate with you only in writing from now on. Then they can write you that either 1) further efforts to collect the debt are terminated, 2) certain actions may be taken by the debt collector, or 3) the debt collector is definitely going to take certain actions.\n\nSend your letter via certified mail, return receipt requested so you can prove receipt. Include your account number and the certified mail receipt number, and say you're writing the letter pursuant to federal and state credit collection law requesting that they stop telephoning you and that they communciate with you only in writing. Say that they've been violating the federal Fair Debt Collections Practices Act and the California Debt Collection Practices Act by violating your privacy and harrassing you, including calling X times per days at your work and home and by making misleading threats to contact 3rd parties about your debts. Say that the letter is not meant in any way to be an acknowledgment that you owe them money, and that you'll take care of this matter when you can.\n\nIf the debt collector communicates with you beyond the single instance allowed by law, you can seek punitive action against the debt collector for violating debt collection practices. In CA, the original creditor is bound by similar rules.\n\nif you've already told them that your workplace prohibits these call, they can't call you at work - that's a FDRCP violation, too, and they can be found liable for $1,000 for each violation plus your lawyer's fees. They can't call your references or any other 3rd parties.\n\nGet a consumer lawyer to pursue this is the letter doesn't fix things.\n\nDisclaimer: Please note that this answer does not constitute legal advice, and should not be relied on, since each state has different laws, each situation is fact specific, and it is impossible to evaluate a legal problem without a comprehensive consultation and review of all the facts and documents at issue.

        "Yes, you can file for bankruptcy before or after a creditor has sued you. While you may not currently have wages that can be garnished, a creditor can possible levy a bank account in your name after obtaining a judgment or place a lien against any real property you may own. A judgment is good for 10 years and can be renewed for another 10 years. Bankruptcy is one method for wiping out debts even after debts have been reduced to judgments.",
        "Yes you can file for bankruptcy after you have been sued. I do this for my clients quite often. Filing for bankruptcy creates a \"stay\" which stops the lawsuit against you.

        "File the bankruptcy before they get a judgment against you and they will not be able to file.\n\nWhen you file Bankruptcy you create a financial estate.

It does not matter if a person files a Chapter 7 or a Chapter 13 Bankruptcy. These exemptions apply to all cases:\nHomestead exemption: This is where the homeowner who is on the Deed and living in the property gets to protect $50,000.00 (in New York…other States Vary!!!)each (up to two) of equity in the property. So, if one person is on the Deed and they live in the house and the home is worth $50,000.00 and is paid off, they get to keep the home and no one can try and take it if they file Bankruptcy. If two people are on the Deed and reside in the home the house can be paid off and worth $100,000.00 and nothing will happen to it if they file a Bankruptcy.\nPersonal property: The vast majority of people do not have to worry about losing property when they file Bankruptcy. However, it is your obligation to report all property. Most people’s furniture, bedroom sets, dining room sets, clothes, etc. are normal consumer items that we list, but since the PERSONAL PROPERTY EXEMPTION IN NEW YORK IS $10,000.00 DOLLARS (In New York…check your State) we have found that it is not worth the trouble by the Trustee appointed to oversee your Bankruptcy to take and sell the property.\nDON’T:\nTake out a second mortgage to pay credit cards;\nTransfer property to family members or friends to “protect it”;\nTake money out of your retirement account to pay credit cards.\nREQUEST: Please give this answer a \"thumbs up\"(below) if you find it valuable.\nDisclaimer: This answer does not constitute legal advice.

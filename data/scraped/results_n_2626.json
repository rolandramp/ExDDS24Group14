        "In this situation you are likely going to have to just play the odds. There is no certain answer as to whether the HELOC lender will foreclose once your loan matures in August. However in the current climate you may be able to just keep making the payments and the lender will accept them. I'm assuming that on your HELOC you are just making interest payments. I would not recommend that you make payments that reduce the principal on the loan unless you get an extension of the maturity date. You should be alert that some lenders are very reluctant to work with you post discharge, however, if you are the only one that owes the debt (or did owe it prior to obtaining your discharge) they will likely be easier to work with. Hope this helps some.",
        "I agree with others that once the balloon payment is not made, you are in default of the loan and the 2nd mortgage can legally foreclose. Whether they foreclose or not may depend on how much equity is in the property above the first mortgage.\n\nIf there is equity, you might consider selling the property. Alternatively, you can approach the 2nd mortgage about a loan modification. Also, under certain circumstances, the full amount of the balloon may be paid off in a chapter 13 bankruptcy over 5 years. Unfortunately, depending on the amount of the balloon, those payments could be prohibitively high.",
        "A payment, balloon or otherwise, is a payment. If you don't pay it you are in default on your mortgage (second mortgage is still a mortgage) and BOTH your mortgages may foreclose. (the first to protect its own interest when you don't pay the second, the second because you are in default).",
        "Life is a gamble. Although few 2nd mortgage lenders foreclose unless there is a huge equity position in the property, some will. Others are willing to accept a settlement of as little as 10% of the balance if the property is underwater. Your odds are going to depend on details you haven't provided. Hope this perspective helps!",
        "The lender will retain the right to foreclose after BK as long as you own the house. I suggest that you seek a mortgage modification with the goal to reach an agreement to extend the balloon payment due date.",
        "If the balloon payment is not made, then the lender has the legal right to foreclose on your property. They may or may not depending on what equity there is above the first, and is it worth their efforts.\n\nYou may be able to sell the property, negotiate the balloon payment, and walk away with some money. The bankruptcy court has no ability to alter the terms of the balloon payment. From your statements, there is equity above the balance of the first, therefore, the second is not subject to a lien strip."

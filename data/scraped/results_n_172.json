        "There are limits in bankruptcy as to how much land value can be protected. There are two sets of bankruptcy protection laws in California and depending on your circumstances one set may be more favorable than the other. 703 vs 704 was discussed previously. You really need to have an experienced bankruptcy lawyer on your side to help you navigate the bankruptcy laws and process.",
        "No land, vacant or otherwise, is just \"exempt\". California has different statutory exemptions for amounts of equity in various types of property. Depending on which you choose (under the guidance of an experienced attorney), as well as what the value of the vacant land is, you may or may not be able to exempt it in whole or in part.\n\nThe other responses here have given you an overview of the California exemption schemes that can be used. What works best for you can only be determined after a comprehensive consult with an experienced bankruptcy attorney.",
        "I agree with my colleagues that vacant land alone cannot constitute a homestead. You must make it your domicile. That could be accomplished by moving a mobile home or even recreational vehicle onto the property in a manner that is consistent with making it your place of residence. Preferably, there would be some form of utilities. But even if electric power comes from a generator and heating is by propane, if you reside within a structure of sorts, you could claim it is your residence. People have successfully claimed homesteads in live-aboard boats, floating homes tethered to piers, and RVs and fifth wheels maintained in residential RV parks. It is always advisable to have your voter registration, driver's license and other forms of evidence of your intended residence reflect the address of the property you are seeking to protect with the homestead exemption.\n\nAlso bear in mind that the homestead laws have been overhauled in California effective January 1, 2021. The new homestead is a minimum of $300,000 and a maximum of $600,000, depending on which county the residence is maintained, and is based upon the median price of a home sale and the prior year. With 58 counties in California, you would need to look to the new statute for your county.",
        "There are different types of exemptions available in California. For example, you have a wildcard exemption under the 703 exemptions, but that is approximately only ~$30k for use on any property. A homestead exemption, can range between $75k to $175k depending on age (and will be increasing substantially this Jan 1., 2021.). However, the homestead exemption requires it to be your primary residence. A future plan, is not a current primary residence to use the homestead exemption under 704.",
        "Vacant land is not exempt unless and until you live on it. Perhaps you can put a mobile home on the lot and connect it to the electric and water lines. If you change your address to that location, you might be able to show you are living there permanently. If so, the property can be exempted up to a certain amount.\n\nRemember, BK is more than checking boxes on forms you find online.

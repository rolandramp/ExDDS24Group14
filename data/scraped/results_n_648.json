        "I wish every person could hear this message. If someone is considering Debt Settlement, whether it be called Debt Relief or if they say, \"You qualify for this program if you owe $10,000 or more to pay 1/2 of the debt you owe,\" you are listening to an advertisement for a scam. The fact is, the vast majority of people can obtain debt relief primarily two ways: Through a properly managed Debt Management Program (DMP), or through filing Bankruptcy. The only DMPs that will work are those provided by well-recognized and accredited, truly non-profit (not one who says that they are non-profit) organization like Money Management International. Creditors trust that true, accredited non-profits will pay them fairly, so they willingly lower the interest rate that is required on credit cards (not medical bills or personal loans) so that the payments become smaller. Then you would make one payment to the DMP company, and they would pay your creditors for you. This process usually takes at least 5-8 years to complete, and you have to pay 100% of the principle balances on your cards; they do not lower the balance of your debt until you pay it down. Very few people are able to maintain this kind of plan until it is finished.\n\nThe reason these other scams do not work, and that includes National Debt..., is because they take your money, pay themselves first based on the amount of debt that you owe (not based upon their performance), and then after they are paid all or nearly all the fees they charge you, they start saving your payments until they have enough to settle the first debt for 50% or so. The problem, thou gh, is that they settle the smallest debt first, to give you the impression that they are doing something. While they start saving your money in their account, and paying your smaller debts, they are not speaking with your other creditors. As time goes by, your debt to the other companies grow, so even if they got around to paying larger debts, the larger debt is greater than when you started, so settling for 50% of a larger debt is not really a savings of 50% of the debt you started with, which was their promise to you in the first place. The very worst fact of the matter is that these companies are paid to pay off all of your debt, but when you have to quit their program, they will not refund your money to you.\n\nThis is why you will have to quit their program, and you now know this to be true: Sooner, rather then later, creditors feel as though they are being stiffed. They are not impressed that you are trying to settle your debts in this fashion, so they sue you. They have no obligation to \"wait their turn\" before they get paid. By suing you, they jump to the front of the line, win the lawsuit, then garnish your wages or levy your bank account. Once your wages are garnished, you can no longer afford your consolidation payment, so you quit the consolidation effort and end up in one of our offices to file Bankruptcy.\n\nWhy wait any longer? Go see a Bankruptcy attorney immediately for a free consultation and you will be led to a much safer place. Do not send any more money to the company you were dealing with. It obviously does not work, and you will need that money to hire a Bankruptcy Attorney. Finally, get your money out of the bank as soon as possible. Once the one who sues you gets a judgment, they will ask the court for a levy on your bank accounts. They can completely drain your bank accounts. They are not limited to 25% as a wage garnishment is. You have very little time to act, so find a well-reviewed and experienced local attorney here on AVVO (\"Find a Layer tab\"), and get protected!",

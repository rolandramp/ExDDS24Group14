        "Much depends on the time frame you are working with. Chapter 7 may be the best option if you qualify income and asset wise. It will often be over within 4-5 months, and a discharge of debt can be obtained. At that point, you will no longer owe any money to the creditors. The mere filing of Bankruptcy should not prevent you from obtaining work, even though some companies may ask if you have filed in the past. As always, your individual situation may be different, so please consult an experienced bankruptcy attorney before making any decisions.",
        "Whether to file bankruptcy or set up a payment plan is really going to depend on your financial situation. Is your income enough where you can afford a payment plan? Or do you not have a lot of income right now? If you do not have a lot of income and you do not own any substantial assets then bankruptcy may be the best solution for you to eliminate your debt and start fresh, especially if your credit has already taken a hit.\n\nIf you have enough income to afford a repayment plan then you may want to consider that. I would recommend speaking to an experienced bankruptcy attorney to discuss your current situation and financial picture. They will be able to guide you on what the best option is for you right now but ultimately the decision of whether to file bankruptcy or not is a personal decision that you will have to make.",
        "\"improving my credit\" will not be achieved in the short term by filing bankruptcy. That said, you may have a better chance of getting a security clearance if you are not burdened with debt. Most unsecured debts can be successfully discharged in bankruptcy. Negotiating a repayment plan directly with your creditors lacks the certainty of a favorable outcome. Some creditors with negotiate while others will not. My advice is twofold:\n(1) Discuss the implications of a bankruptcy discharge with your prospective employer. Legally, an employer is not permitted to deny employment to anyone who has filed for bankruptcy, unless your employer requires you to be bonded, and where you will be handling company funds. (2) Consult an Avvo bankruptcy lawyer who can determine whether or not a bankruptcy will be effective in your situation and what type of bankruptcy best fits your circumstances. Talk with 2-3 after reading the client/peer reviews. If you don't get a prompt call back, go to the next one on your list. Some of us offer a free consultation by phone or in person.

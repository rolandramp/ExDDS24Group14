    "question": "No creditors showed up at the meeting of the creditors and the trustee is ready to close the case? Does this mean all debts are going to be discharged? I have a HOA lien tied to my property I am living in now, a few other judgements and a disputed, contingent mortgage (that is in a non-judicial foreclosure proceeding bk hold). I am concerned with how and who will be dealing with those obigations. Will the BK Judge be requiring a proof of claim on the disputed mortgage? And will I be responsible for filing other notices to eliminate the lien and judgements?",

        "You need to make sure that you take the second class and file the certificate of completion with the court along with form B23, a declaration that you took the class.

        "I recommend that you read the form B9A that informed you of the 341 meeting, as it will contain information such as the deadline for your creditors to file an objection to your bankruptcy. A statutory lien that exists when you filed bankruptcy is not removed by filing bankruptcy, although it is discharged. The HOA could still collect under the lien by foreclosing on your property if this issue isn't resolved. It is possible to remove a judgment lien, but this is a separate action and requires a skillful effort. Frankly, you just costing yourself money by proceeding pro se, but you can certainly make the effort if you like. You have an incredibly complex case that requires a great deal of skill and experience.\n\nUnless there are assets available for your trustee to distribute, your creditors will not file claims, and in any event, secured creditors do not have to file claims because they can rely on their security interest for payment. Hope this perspective helps!",

        "Congrats on getting through the creditors meeting, pro se? And as a person familiar with Walnut Creek, let me say it is good to see Pinky's back in action. If everything goes well from this point forward, and if you have completed the financial management course (pre-discharge course) and filed the completion certificate along with the supporting declaration, you should expect to receive, about 61 days or so from the creditors meeting, and for your creditors to be noticed with, the chapter 7 discharge order. If you are going it alone, you may want to schedule a consultation with an experienced bankruptcy attorney to review what debts are dischargeable and if any action is recommended prior to the completion of your case to ensure that avoidable liens are removed, if possible. I recommend scheduling that consultation right away. Whatever nominal amount an attorney may charge you for this review will be well worth the peace of mind, if nothing else.\nGood luck!"

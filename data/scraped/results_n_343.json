        "If you deposit your alimony money in your bank, a creditor having a money judgment against you can satisfy that judgment by levying on your assets, including bank accounts. Mortgage lenders are going to foreclose on the real estate securing the debt, so they will not be able to get a money judgment against you. They prefer to get the property back instead."

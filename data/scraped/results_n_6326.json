        "In my opinion, you would best be served by filing a joint return, which would not only give you an extra dependency exemption, but also help in other ways, e.g., increasing your standard deduction, and raising the phase out threshold of the child tax credit.\n\nYou would not be normally personally responsible for his debts incurred during the marriage, far less those incurred prior to it. In the case of unpaid taxes, Federal student loans or child support on his part, which could be collected from a joint refund, you can avoid them being taken from any withholding or refund based on your income by writing \"Injured Spouse\" in the upper left corner of the joint return and filing a Form 8379 with your 1040.\n\nIf the \"restitution\" is connected with the issue for which your fiance is doing time, e.g., repaying the victim of a theft or fraud, it has nothing to do with your taxes or refund.\n\nI am assuming he has little or no income while he is incarcerated. Do seek first hand professional advice on this issue, particularly since you have gotten conflicting advice here, so far.",
        "The issue is you do not want to be responsible from your future spouse's previous tax liability, if any.\n\nIf you want to be treated separate from your future spouse's tax liabilities, you may need to file married filing separate. Under current federal tax law, you can not claim your spouse as a dependent and file as a head of household or single. Filing married joint may expose you to joint liability. I advise you to consult a tax attorney or a cpa so that they can review the restitution documents."

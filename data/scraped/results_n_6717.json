    "title": "My 50/50 partner has locked me out of the store, changed banking info and thinks she can just change the name of the store -",
    "question": "What are my rights as a partner going on a verbal agreement, no contract? Also, our names are on most everything showing us a partner except for the resale license, which is under me. I did want a buy out but now with the dishonesty, I want out completely and the store shut down, what are my legal rights on doing that? How can you just rename a business and start over without me knowing or the right legal documents filed to dissolve the partnership? I am so confused and need help!!",

        "You need to consult with a corporate litigation attorney to assist you in protecting your \"rights\". Unfortunately, it will be more complex because of your having failed to enter into a written agreement, and your using a 'partnership' rather than a corporation or LLC.\n\nThe time to protect your \"rights\" is before, rather than after, there is trouble. At this point it will not be clear what your \"rights\" are, since you never tried to protect them before.",
        "You have referred several times to your “partner” and the “partnership,” but you filed the post under LLC. Which is it? The difference matters in determining your rights and remedies. If you have “no contract,” does that mean you have not filed Articles for an LLC? I will assume that it is a partnership, so you are relying on the CA statute as to partnership rights. Messrs Doland and Hanson have some useful and erudite suggestions. I agree generally with both of them. However, it sounds like she is not about to settle. You need to decide how much the business is worth and whether it is worth investing in hiring a business lawyer to help you recover what she owes you, which is half of everything, plus possibly punitive damages for breach of her fiduciary duties to you.",
        "Do I need to tell you it was a mistake not to get a written, signed Operating Agreement when you were getting along? Such an agreement could spell out the answers to a lot of your questions.\n\nYou two owe each other what are called fiduciary duties. Big legal names for \"play nice.\" Neither one of you have the right to take advantage of the other to benefit yourself.\n\nWay back in 1928, a famous Judge in New York, Benjamin N.

And you are probably going to have to hire an experienced business lawyer, and sue to undo what has been done. You know who is going to win that suit? The lawyers.

Are there personally guaranteed debts of the business, and if so, will the buyer get the seller released? Or agree to indemnify her?

If it doesn't work, however, I believe you will be in a stronger position to convince a judge, or a jury, as to the reasonableness of your price and terms because you were willing to take either side of the deal.\n\nSometimes this works. I wish you the best of luck.\n\nBoth Jesus and Abraham Lincoln encouraged people to settle their disputes as quickly as possible. Why? Because its the best way.

        "The state of California imposes a partnership agreement by statute on any two or more persons doing business together. It is located in the California Corporations code. To enforce your rights you will have to go to court, although you might consider giving one chance to your \"partner\" to go to mediation to try to fashion a \"win-win\" as opposed to a \"win-lose\" which is litigation. Trying to involuntarily dissolve a statutory partnership (and sue for breach of fiduciary duty) would almost certainly benefit from an attorney, at least to prepare the complaint if not assist you thereafter on the way to trial. Some lawyers offer \"unbundled\" legal services and sell certain legal \"products\" without becoming your attorney of record. Otherwise, go to your county law library and look for California Forms of Pleading and Practice. Final hint, 200 hundred consecutive questions on Avvo won't be the same as having an attorney."

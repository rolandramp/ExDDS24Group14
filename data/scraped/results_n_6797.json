    "title": "Does my girlfriend need to file for bankruptcy protection before we get married?",
    "question": "My assets are pretty big which includes house, car, business, etc. But my girlfriend, soon to be my fiance, walked away from her mortgage, has $80K credit card debt, and is unemployed. When we get married, can her creditors come after my asset or am I protected because her financial problems happened before we got married? She doesn't want to file for bankruptcy but does she need to in order to save my assets, soon to be our assets?",
    "answers": [
        "It would seem to me that your soon to be fiancé needs to consult with a bankruptcy attorney in your area. She would seem to be a good candidate for a Chapter 7 filing, which could give her the fresh start that would seem to be of benefit to your new life together. After marriage, your income and assets would need to be disclosed as mentioned by Mr. Chawla, above. This could have the effect of forcing a Chapter 13 or even a Chapter 11 filing, which would commit your income to a repayment plan, approved by the court, for a minimum of 5 years. I would need to know what you mean by “pretty big” assets, in order to determine the potential effect. Most likely filing for bankruptcy protection before marriage makes good sense.\n\nAnother issue you may want to consider is what type of estate plan you need to have in place. This is a good idea for anyone considering marriage, and is particularly true in your case. There are techniques available to effectively manage this issue, but since you do not mention it I thought it would be wise to raise the issue for you now.\n\nAs you are likely aware, California is a community property state. The essential impact of this on you is that the pre-marital debts and assets of you and your fiancé are considered separate property, unless comingled or otherwise made community property. Once you and she marry, all debts and assets acquired become yours and hers jointly as part of the community’s estate. You would be well served to consult with an experienced family law attorney well prior to your marriage to analyze these issues in depth and also to review the propriety of a prenuptial agreement to protect your apparently substantial assets.\n\nI wish you the very best of luck in your preparation for your upcoming marriage.",
        "I'd say from a strategic long term point of view, get her to file bankruptcy ASAP. No creditor will be able to go after any of your assets that are separate property but as time goes on in a marriage, assets can become mixed. Also, joint accounts can be a major issue. Finally, once you are married, there may be an issue with the means test. You should protect your financial position by making sure your fiance has taken care of her financial position. 80k of credit card debt and she is on unemployment means she should run to file Chap 7 ASAP. Consult a local and experienced bankruptcy attorney ASAP.\n\nDean",
        "I agree with my colleagues here in that you will definitely want to speak with both a California Family Attorney and a California Bankruptcy Attorney BEFORE you get married. As I'm sure you know, California is a community property state. While the assets you own prior to marriage are technically considered Separate Property, there are things you can do while married which can create a community interest in the assets (ie. transmutations, investing community funds into separate property, etc…). Also, after you are married, technically speaking your income is a community asset, and if you do what most couples do (sharing bank accounts, paying bills together, etc...) there are ways creditors can \"get around\" to collecting from you/your income. As long as creditors are owed, they will continue to harass not only your girlfriend, but also you, potentially even calling you at work or calling your family as well (creditors/collection agents have absolutely no decency).\n\nIf this harassment becomes too much, and after you are married, if your then wife decides she wants to file for bankruptcy, your assets must be listed in her bankruptcy petition (even if you aren’t filing with her) AND your income must be included on the means test (ie. the \"qualification\" test for filing a bankruptcy) and on her income schedules. The fact that a non-filing spouses assets and income must be listed always tends to be a shock to prospective bankruptcy filers.\n\nWhile I can't personally speak to the Family Law issues as that is not my particular area of expertise, as an experienced California Bankruptcy Attorney, I’ve had many clients, who were unmarried upon retaining my firm only to later get married before we filed their cases, have to delay filing bankruptcy (or not file all together) because of the risk of loss of their/their spouses assets and/or because they no longer “qualify” to file because of the inclusion of their new spouse’s income.\n\nAgain, I completely agree with my colleagues that you should seek the advice of California Attorneys, especially given the risks associated with moving forward without guidance, and the minimal time and financial cost of getting qualified guidance now. Again, I can’t speak for family law attorneys, but as far as many bankruptcy attorneys go (including my firm), there is generally little to no cost to meet and discuss your/your girlfriend’s case/concerns. Should you have any further questions, please feel free to contact my firm. I hope this information was helpful to you.",
        "Hi there,\n\nFirst, I would ask why she does not want to file for bankruptcy. It sounds like her credit is destroyed, she has no income and massive debt. If thinks she can pay it down and would prefer to do so that's fine, but otherwise but otherwise that debt will probably never leave her. She will have creditors trying to collect for the foreseeable future. She would likely benefit greatly from discharging all of her debt and getting a fresh start through bankruptcy regardless, particularly if she is starting a new life with you.\n\nAs to your exposure to liability, it would only apply to joint assets. Anything solely in your name would likely not be subject to her creditors. Her name could not be on any bank account, property or other asset. Any assets she holds independently would be subject to collection action by her creditors, so she would likely be unable to have a bank account, car, etc. in her name. Whether she filed before or after marriage might not make much of a difference, but there is likely little to gain by waiting. She should speak with a bankruptcy attorney immediately.",
        "Consult with an attorney in person before you do ANYTHING. You could have a problem if filing joint returns because if there id a refund coming the creditors could go after it. that is just one problem I though of. There may or may not be others. you need to discuss this matter in greater detail with more facts revealed to the legal counselor.",
        "Any money that you contribute to her household should already be included in her schedules. You need to check with a California lawyer about how community property laws affect everything else. As I understand it, you are not responsible for her pre-marriage debt, but I would not risk it.\n\nWhy not have her address her debt BEFORE marriage IF that is the right course to take.\n\nGet a consultation. It can't hurt."

    "title": "Is it possible to assume my dad's auto loan now that he is deceased? He is the only person on the title. I'd like to keep it.",
    "question": "My dad purchased this vehicle one year ago and died in it this past Monday. He was asleep in the back seat. I would like to keep the car and continue making payments. This car meant so much to him and since it was his official last resting place I would like to continue payments and purchase the car myself. Can I do that by assuming the loan somehow? Please advise.",

        "If you Dad had a will, then the car would go to whomever he designated to have the car. If he did not, then it would go to his children in equal shares. If you are his only child then the car would go to you. If there is a lien on the car, such as a loan, then that would need to be paid in order for you to take title. If you cannot afford the total loan amount you can ask the loan company to allow you to assume the loan.",
        "You should contact the financing company regarding this issue and ask them what documentation they need from you to complete this process. They will probably be agreeable.\n\nBW",
        "Did your Dad have a will? If so, the will dictates the new owner of the vehicle. Anyone wishing to prevent the car's repossession can pay the finance company, if they have the account information to do so. If there was no will, you should refer to the intestacy statute of the state where he lived to determine how the ownership of his property will be determined."

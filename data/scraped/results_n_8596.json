    "title": "HOW TO APPEAL A LEVY JUDGEMENT against my bank account",
    "question": "I had a judgement that levied my bank account on a certain day. I called the creditor and they will not talk to me since they have judgement to get all monies in my account. Can I go back to court and appeal or try to set up payment through the court?",
    "answers": [
        "You can challenge the amount taken - they should have given you some paperwork when they served you. You can then have a court date and argue about how much they can take. Unless you were not served properly you probably don't have much of a case to appeal or reopen. You can also file a chapter 7 or chapter 13 and that will stop additional levy. (but follow up on the challenge.)",
        "I am unclear about your question or the situation. I understand that your bank account was levied. Reading between the lines this is by a creditor on a debt you owed, but I cannot tell the status of how a judgment was entered against you. Were you properly served and failed to answer? Did you answer and then a judgment was entered against you? If you were not served, how did you learn about this case and when? Appeals require filing within the time required by the law that applies, and it is unclear in your situation which procedures apply to your case.",
        "First I must say that I am not licensed to practice in your jurisdiction; however if your state has a similar garnishment proceeding to Illinois, there are certain exemptions that you may claim on the court date already set. Have you read the paperwork closely that notified you of the garnishment? There may be details regarding these exemptions and how to claim them."

    "title": "I was required to take an early retirement from the State of CA. Can my pension be attached, if not what can they take?",
    "question": "I took an early retirement with the State of CA, Department of Consumer Repair, Bureau of Automotive Repair. I was a safety employee like highway patrol. I became 100% disabled according to my doctors at that time and according to the Welfare Department. My income just went up from approx 600.00 to 1000.00 per month after canceling my insurance and accepting medical. Directly after my retirement I filed bankruptcy approximately 8 plus years ago, which included my home.. The only thing of value I own is a 20 year old wrecked truck. A credit card company has sold my dept, all other credit is paid on time and has been for years. The original credit card company lowered my credit so that even if I made a full payment I would still get a late charge. I have been in that viscous cycle before bankruptcy and lost everything trying to play their game. I'm 59 3/4, and need to know what the creditors purchaser can take, my pension, my truck, put me in jail? Can I just go to jail? Assistance appreciated.",

However California law also provides EXEMPTIONS, which allow the debtor to keep certain property, even if that means the the judgment will remain unpaid. Government pension payments are EXEMPT and the creditors cannot those funds to satisfy a judgment. A car or truck may be exempt or partially exempt, but its very unlikely that any creditor is going to try and levy (take) a 20 year old truck. That type of action would be more likely if you owned a very valuable late-model car; but even then it would be unlikely.\n\nFinally, owing a debt is not a crime; you will not be charged with a crime for being unable to pay a debt.

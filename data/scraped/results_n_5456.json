        "For a case management meeting have a summary of the current status of the case and what the parties plan to do in the future. To meet and confer simply call up the opposing party's attorney and discuss the case and whether it can be settled. To request documents a discovery request is necessary. A discovery request lists the type of documents or information needed and it is served on the other party with a deadline. If this is done properly the other party must comply.",

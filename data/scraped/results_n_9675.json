        "A claim of exemption is the procedure to fight the levy. The person making the claim of exemption must do so within the required time. Your question is a little confusing, but it sounds like the money which was levied belongs to your spouse and the judgment debt was incurred before you were married, which is an issue which may be raised in a claim of exemption. In addition, you may be able to have the judgment vacated if your were not properly served through an appropriate motion in the court that entered it. You should consult with an attorney to discuss the particulars of the matter and for any specific legal advice."

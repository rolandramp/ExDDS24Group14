    "question": "We agree on everything but we don't want to give such sensitive information to our lawyers as this could lead to some sort of identity theft (not by them but someone else). In any case, would a statement like \"any financial account that is in each person's name, and only that person's name, prior to the marriage, will remain separate during the marriage and will be the the sole responsibility of that person in the event of a divorce\" be better than listing a specific account that will change balances and possibly account numbers over the years?",

        "You're not required to have a prenup at all.\n\nIf you want to have an enforceable pre-nup, however, one of the critical requirements is that you both make a complete disclosure of your finances.\n\nThat doesn't necessarily require a list of account numbers, but would certainly require an listing of approximate account balances. The reason for this, is that, in the event of a dispute, the court's view of the fairness of an agreement might be very different for an agreement which simply says the parties each have one bank account when they enter into the agreement, than it would be if it also included the information that Husband-to-be's account balance was $100, and Wife-to-be's account balance was, say $1,000,000.",
        "Your proposed \"statement\" would be grossly inadequate for a prenup. I agree with Ms. Jasinsky's response. Provide sufficient information regarding your accounts and debts that will enable you and your husband to identify those accounts and obligations in the future, but you needn't provide more than the last four digits of those accounts in the Prenup for security reasons. When you exchange account and debt documents in making your disclosures for the Prenup, provide your intended spouse exact photocopies of the actual documents, including account numbers, to make complete and accurate disclosure. Each party should retain his and her own Family Law Attorney with regard to the Prenup.",
        "Pre-nups can be tricky because they are not tested until there is a dispute, which is sometimes years later and hopefully, never. Therefore, to be on the safe side you should be as specific as possible.\n\nOne possible way that might alleviate your concerns is to consider doing what banks and credit card companies do on-line and only identify the account by its last digits, such as\" \"Acme bank account # XXX-XXXX-XXX-1234.\" That should provide at least some level of safety from identity theft.\n\nMore importantly, it sounds like you have an attorney working with you on the agreement and your intended should have his or her own attorney review the agreement as well. By each of you being represented by counsel, this provides a level of proof that that the agreement was fair and well considered by both of you."

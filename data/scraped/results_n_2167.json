        "A lot of lenders stop sending you statements because they don't want to get in trouble for sending you statements which can be construed as collecting on a discharged debt. You can send them a letter asking that they resume sending you statements or have your lawyer do that if you are still in an active bankruptcy.",
        "No sure I completely agree with my colleagues. The lender may not send any correspondence to try to collect a debt when you file for bankruptcy protection. However, you may request the statements. Your attorney may also send a letter stipulating that sending statements would not be a violation of the stay. Additionally, you may contact the CFPB - check out the following link: http://www.consumerfinance.gov/blog/a-model-form-for-mortgage-statements/ You may request information from your lender under the RESPA laws and your lender must comply.",
        "Have you tried getting the information from them online.",
        "I concur with my colleague Berkus. At the end of every year, you will receive a report showing how much you paid, the allocation to principal, interest and impounds. You don't really \"need\" the details each month, although it is annoying not to see it except annually. If you want to pay extra amounts on your monthly mortgage payment simply tell them in a letter attached to your check. Some lenders simply take out the interest amount and impound amount then apply whatever is left toward the principal.",
        "It is legal and it is common. It is a rather conservative view on the discharge injunction. Once a debt is discharge (your personal obligation to pay the mortgage was discharged, but the lien against the property survives; hence why you have to keep paying to keep your house), a creditor cannot take any action that would be viewed as an attempt to collect a payment. Monthly statements tend to be viewed as collection attempts (they don't really contain that much information). Technically, there is no law that requires them to send you a \"monthly\" statement. Now, they still have to send certain statements...they do have to send you the periodic escrow analysis (when they refigure your escrow, they do have to send you that). And you can periodically send a qualified RESPA request to get an accounting of your mortgage."

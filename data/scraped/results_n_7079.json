        "I would prepare a consent order for both of you to sign reflecting the settlement agreement...specifically stating that the debt is not discharged pursuant to 523a(5) and (15) rather than dismissing the case...I always feel better with a signed final order. Once the consent order is entered the court will close the case as settled rather than dismissing it.",

        "Interspousal means between spouses. After your divorce, neither of you are considered the \"spouse\" of the other. Sorry.",
        "No, only legally married property owners can do an interspousal transfer deed. Not sure why the disposition of the house you own together was not addressed in your divorce. Did you just get a status only judgment and left the division of debts and assets to be decided later? While some lenders will entertain a loan modification with just one borrower, loan modifications are difficult enough without the added problem of getting one of the borrowers off the loan. Lenders don't have a big incentive to agree to that because they figure having two people responsible for the loan is better than one. Another option is maybe a HARP refinance if your ex qualifies for the loan on his own (i.e., without your income and based on his own credit). Without more detailed facts, it's really impossible to accurately assess your situation and provide a meaningful answer. There are just too many variables. Aside from being an attorney, I am also a real estate broker knowledgeable in the loan modification process (I wrote \"12 Steps to Loan Modification Success\").\nIf you had an attorney who handled your divorce, you may also want to consult with him or her about this leftover issue.",

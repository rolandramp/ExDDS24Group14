    "question": "I previously filled out an fl-160 in my response and now his lawyer is asking for a fl-142. its basically the same info but my question is there are several community debts I have already paid but am seeking reimbursement for and he was paid out on a car which he was suppose to give me half and I would like to ask for that but theres really no room for explanation on the form or who has already taken care of it etc. Also I responded with all financial info so we could figure out child support and he hasn't provided me or filed the same docs how do I ask the courts for his financial records",

        "The FL-142, Schedule of Assets and Debts, and the FL-160, Property Declaration, are quite similar. The FL-160 can be filed with the court, without attachments of financial documents, while the FL-142 requires the attachment of financial documents, but is not filed with the court. Confusing? I sometimes believe those who design the forms do not actually practice family law. There are several ways you can request financial information from your spouse. Has he served you with a Preliminary Declaration of Disclosure (\"PDOD\") (which includes a Schedule of Assets and Debts and Income and Expense Declaration, both with documentation)? If not, he should and if he has not done so within the time limits set out by statute you can file a Request For Order to have him do so. You should also have a Family Review Conference (\"FRC\") on calendar and you can point out you have not received the PDOD. You can serve Form Interrogatories, Special Interrogatories and/or a Demand For Production Of Documents. You would be well served to retain the services of an experienced family attorney given your husband has counsel and it appears the are doing all of the getting and none of the giving. If for some reason you want to venture into discovery as a self-represented litigant, you can go to the nearest law library and review the treatises on discovery.",
        "An FL-142 is used as part of a Declaration of Disclosure requirement. The FL-160's are not even though much is duplicated on the form. As to his financials, you need to write a demand letter and if the demand is not meet, the file an RFO to request the court order him to provide these. Also you need to do proper \"discovery\" to get the documents. Why don't you have an attorney?",
        "I would add, if he has a lawyer, you need one too.",
        "With your preliminary declaration of disclosure you can submit either an fl-160 or fl-142. Typically in Form Interrgatories, the only side will be seeking an updated fl-142. If it is the same information, just provide it and save yourself the hassle of a motion to compel."

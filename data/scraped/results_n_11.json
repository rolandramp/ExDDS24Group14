    "title": "My parents filed a bankruptcy and Wells Fargo froze my account?",
    "question": "My parents filed a bankruptcy and wells fargo froze my money because my checking account was opened with my dad as cosigner when I was a teenager over 10 years ago. I’ve been financially independent for years and get my work direct deposit to the account. The money in the account is 100% mine. can I get my money back?",
    "answers": [
        "I had to deal with Wells in a case where they froze the account. I got a letter form the Trustee stating he had no interest in the funds. That did the trick. As for Wells policy, it is a bad one which has cost them thousands in attorney's fees. They need to re-think it.",
        "As others have said, this is what Wells Fargo does. The Bank doesn't want to get in trouble with the bankruptcy trustee by releasing funds that might belong to the bankruptcy estate. You need to work with your parents' bankruptcy attorney AND the bk trustee to arrange for a letter or email from the bk trustee telling the Bank it is OK to release their freeze on your account. This may have to wait until the time your parents have their meeting with the bk trustee unless your parents' attorney can persuade the trustee sooner.",
        "My colleagues have given you good advice with which I concur. Your parents lawyer should be able to expedite the release of your funds. If they don't have a lawyer, use the AVVO feature “Find a Lawyer”. Make a list of 4-5 having many 5 star reviews from satisfied clients. If you don't get a prompt call back from one, go on to the next on your list. Some offer a free consultation by phone or in person. Take us up on it. Good luck and God bless.",
        "I agree 100% with Attorney Markus. WF is the ONLY bank that continually does that. However, I find if the debtor's attorney sends the trustee a notice of this and copy of Schedule C to show it is exempt or to show debtor has NO interest in the account which is really the case with you, the trustee may email WF to release the monies. Often this is done in 1 day! But with trustee not knowing what % of funds in the account or if it is listed on Schedule B is something that must be looked at. Good luck.",
        "This is standard operating procedure for Wells Fargo in bankruptcy cases. The money is frozen, not gone. Assuming your father exempted the funds in the account and the bankruptcy trustee, therefore, does not take them, then the money will be unfrozen once the case is over. Your father's attorney should be able to get the Trustee to accomplish this sooner by communicating with Wells Fargo."

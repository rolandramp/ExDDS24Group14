    "title": "How judgment will effect me with getting a job?",
    "question": "I have no job for more than a year now and because I used to be self employed I was not elligible for unemployment. Right now I might be able to get a job. However, I have 3 judgments (that I know of) against me from credit card companies. They already took the money that I had in my bank account and they said they will also go after my paycheck. I wasn't worry then because I had no job but now there is a chance that I might be able to get one. If I do get hired, what will happen? Will they take ALL of the money from my paycheck? How can I negotiate with them so that I can keep some of the money? I cannot file for BK yet because of some other issue but really want to have a job. Please help. Thank you.",

        "As stated by other colleagues, you can negotiate your debt. If you take this route, it's important to get this settlement in writing--to ensure they don't come after you for more money. Also, you can file a TIMELY Claim of Exemption. If you income is protected and/or it goes all to your basic necessities, you have a good chance of stopping the wage garnishment and/or bank levy--should they also attempt to levy your bank account.\n\nIf you need help with these issues, and need a consumer attorney, a good place to find one is at NACA.net. Good luck.",
        "If you cannot file bankruptcy, you can still call them to negotiate. Below is a link to my Avvo article on making wage garnishment a fair amount for you, if they do find out where you are working. One concern that I have is that there are three judgments against you. An employer is not permitted by law to terminate you for having one wage garnishment, but they can for multiple garnishments. Thus, as soon as you can, you should file the bankruptcy to discharge those debts, if not satisfied, or settle them as soon as possible. I also have on Avvo a legal guide on how to settle debt collection lawsuits, which should help you with some of this process, at least to find out what they want to settle the debt. My other concern: were you served with these lawsuits? How and when did you first learn about them?"

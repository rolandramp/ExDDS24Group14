    "title": "Is a 401k Loan consider income under the means test?",
    "question": "I took a 401k loan less than 6 months ago to pay a secured creditor. Do I have to include the 401k loan as income on the means test (form 22) on my Ch. 7 Bankruptcy in the central district?",
    "question_tags": "Bankruptcy,Chapter 7 bankruptcy means test,Debt,Bankruptcy and debt",
    "answers": [
        "It is a mere technicality, but (as I recall), you can deduct loan repayments of a 401k in the B22 for a Ch 13.\n\nIt is not a deduction for a Ch 7 B22, but I have \"footnoted\" that expense in a Ch 7 that is at/near the income limit.",
        "No, you do not declare distributions or loans against qualified retirement plans on Form B22A,C.",
        "No, a loan from your 401k is not considered income,",
        "No. Withdrawals from Retirement Accounts are excluded as income from the means test; the money in your 401k was income when it was earned, not when it was withdrawn."

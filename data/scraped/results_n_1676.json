    "question": "I just saw a laundry list notice of documents being requested by the trustee before our first meeting. My parents are healthy thank God. However, I believe I am listed as a beneficiary on their estate planning trust. Could this cause me problems in chapter 7 hearing that is coming up?",

        "Short answer is no. The trustee probably just wants to make sure you parents didn't create an irrevocable trust and the fund i with assets that you could access today. Ninety-nine percent of all estate plans use living trust which can be amended or revoked at any time cutting you out if they want. You have a mere expectation of an inheritance and unless your parents die within six months after your bankruptcy, the trustee can't touch it. Nevertheless, your parents trust should have your inheritance going to you in the form of a trust wtih a spendthrift provision which would greatly reduce what the trustee could get even if your parents were to pass away within the six month period.",
        "No. The Chapter 7 Trustee is looking for assets that she can liquidate (sell) to pay back all or a portion of your debts. In your case, you are not entitled to anything in the trust until your parents pass away; hence, although you may receive assets from your parents' estate some time in the future (hopefully many years down the line), you are not in possession of them or legally entitled to them at this moment. However, you'll want to keep your parents safe for the 180 day period following the filing of your case because the Ch 7 trustee would be able to liquidate assets received through the trust if you were entitled to receive them during that ~6 month period.\n\nIt sounds like you were assigned to a trustee with the initials W.K.

        "Your trustee must be Wenta Kosmala, as she asks this of everybody. If your parents are healthy and have a standard \"revocable living trust,\" meaning they can change the terms anytime, then you shouldn't have a problem. If you have a copy, I'd send it to her (redacting your parents' SSNs). If your parents won't give you a copy, send her a note stating same. She can't make you give her a copy of someone else's document. That said, she just wants to make sure that your parents are alive and/or their trust isn't irrevocable.\n\nGood luck!\n\nRob Taylor"

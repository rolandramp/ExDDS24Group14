        "As unfair as it may feel, California is a \"no-fault\" state. This means that the affair has no legal relevance in your divorce case: the court will not consider it in determining your spousal support. Many people try to use texts and e-mails to gain sympathy and give the court a picture of what you had to deal with. At the end of the day, it means nothing under the law. In terms of spousal support (alimony), there are a number of factors that are considered. The court considers, first, if support should be ordered, and, if so, how much and for how long. Temporary support is most often based on a mathematical formula (dissomaster is a common software for this) and often lasts until the divorce is completed, at which time the court will make it's final order. The final order is based on the factors listed in Family Code section 4320.\nDate of separation is another critical issue. I have mediated divorces in which full trials had already been held on the sole issue of date of separation. This is not only a cut-off date for community assets and debts, in a short-term marriage (less than 10 years), it is also a cut-off date for spousal support. Most often, if support is ordered, it lasts, approximately, half the duration of the marriage. There are, of course, situations in which the court does not follow this \"rule of thumb\", so you shouldn't bank on it.\nRather than focusing on investing the time and effort in trying to prove the affair, I would suggest to you invest in a good lawyer, mediator, or collaborative professional to help you sort through this issue. So long as you are focused on the affair and the trauma it has caused you, you will not be able to clearly see and pursue what is in your best legal and emotional interest. It's like trying to negotiate the purchase of a car when you're already in love with it - you're not going to get the best deal.\n\nGood luck.",

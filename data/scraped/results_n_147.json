    "question": "Hey everyone,",

    "answers": [
        "Your instincts are good to ask, but you do not need to appear if you consent to the stay being lifted. There is no other negative thing that will happen to you for not appearing at that hearing.",
        "The hearing is required but you do not need to show up. Because of your lack of opposition, the motion will be granted by the judge and the lender will make arrangements to pick up the car.",
        "No need to appear if you do not oppose the motion.",
        "You can file a Notice of Non-Opposition, so the court can dispense with the hearing. All parties served with the Notice of Motion for Relief from Stay should be served with the Notice of Non-Opposition.\n\nProbably no downside if you can't afford the car and don't want to keep it. By allowing the finance company to repossess, the finance company can't come after you for the loan balance. Just be sure you didn't state in your papers that you \"reaffirm\" the debt.\n\nGOOD LUCK.",
        "You are not required to appear.\nWhy don't you take the car to them and be done with it.\nAre you represented by counsel?\nIf not, and there is no response, the creditor can get the car as soon\nas the order is entered. Make sure your stuff is out of the car or you\nmay not see it again including the license plate",
        "You are not required to appear and you will not suffer any adverse consequence other than the court granting the creditor's motion which will result in them taking possession of the subject vehicle."

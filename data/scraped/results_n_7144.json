    "title": "What are \"reasonable\" attorneys fees and costs?",
    "question": "I'm being sued by my former HOA for dues, late fees, attorney and collection costs that accrued after my bankruptcy filing. I surrendered my condo in my bankruptcy and moved out prior to filing. My condo was officially foreclosed a month after my bankruptcy discharge. My former HOA is suing me for $4000, but the past dues+late fees+attorney & collection costs = closer to $2400 (roughly 6 months of dues, etc). My former HOA and their attorney refuse to settle for the actual amount I owe. I believe they are stalling to run up the attorney/collection fees until there is a trial. And will probably add the trial costs too. Paying $4000 seems wrong (Isn't that extortion?), but what other choices do I have?",

        "I agree, generally, esp. with the admonition against claiming extortion - you aren't being extorted. I am curious, however, about the HOA fees being assessed against you post-bankruptcy. Normally, during the bankruptcy, all property becomes the property of the bankruptcy estate, meaning the trustee is in control. Since you surrendered the condo in bankruptcy, I would strongly question how you are now on the hook for them since, technically, the trustee was supposed to administer the property. I would also question the delay in having the foreclosure take place. I agree that a bankruptcy attorney would have been invaluable in dealing with all this. And, I agree that HOA's are becoming hyper-aggressive in attempting to collect on unpaid dues.\n\nThe amount they are seeking, by itself, isn't unusual at all. You admit that you'd owe about $2500 in dues alone. Adding $1500 for attorney's fees, interest, etc. is a very small amount - I'd say it's quite reasonable, in fact.\n\nThe short answer to your question is this - \"reasonable\" attorney's fees are whatever a court says they are. But, I'd say they are more than \"reasonable\" here.",
        "Here is a pivotal question -- did you have an attorney in your bankruptcy proceeding? This is to whom your question should be directed. The attorney should have explained this to you.\n\nIf you did not retain counsel, then the $4000 being sought exceeds what you would likely have paid an attorney to handle this and provide guidance to you from the outset.\n\nOften condo owners believe that bankruptcy starts or a foreclosure happens, then all obligations are discharged or gone.

        "Extortion is a criminal offense relating to someone being asked to pay money they don't legally owe. Since you legally owe the HOA dues, a court will decide what is reasonable attorney fees and add this to the debt. Costs are the court filing fees, the process service expenses and other verifiable expenses relating to the processing of the paperwork.\n\nA creditor has no obligation to accept an offer that is less than payment in full. You lose a lot of credibility by overstating your grievance by claiming to be a victim of a crime.\n\nHope this perspective helps!"

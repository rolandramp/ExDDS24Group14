    "title": "How long can a trustee hold a trust without distribution?",
    "question": "My mom passed away July 2013-sister is trustee. Six beneficiaries in trust (one minor). Sister and I are not communicating-I asked her attorney how long before trust distribution, and I was told that nothing would be distributed until all beneficiaries have signed a no contest early distribution letter. Two beneficiaries will not sign, they are not contesting the amount of the distribution, only the verbiage written into their specific distribution \"all distributions will be at the discretion of the trustee\" and the fact it stipulates no accounting will be provided to the beneficiaries. I am a beneficiary of 50% of the trust-what should next steps be?",
    "answers": [
        "I agree with my colleagues. There is no specific time dictating when a trustee must make distribution. The trustee must follow the terms of the trust. If the trust assets are to be distributed upon the death of your mother, then the trustee must make distribution within a \"reasonable\" time. What constitutes \"reasonable\" will depend on the complexity of the trust assets and what the trustee has to do before distribution can occur. For example, are the assets easily dividable or do some have to be sold to permit distribution? It may be that a partial distribution can occur now, but the trustee also has to ensure that enough value is retained to pay trust expenses as well as (potentially) the debts of the settlor. You should consult with a trust attorney who can look at the documents and understand the full circumstances for more definitive answers.",
        "There is no set time as to when a trustee must start making distributions. When under the terms of the trust it would be reasonable for a trustee to start making distributions can vary based on many factors, such as the nature of the trust assets, the time needed to collect and, if necessary, to sell assets, the size of the decedent's estate, tax issues and litigation over disputed creditor claims. Since the trust could be liable for the debts of your mom, the trust may want to wait until the 1-year period for making claims against the estate has passed before making distributions, though a different trustee would only keep a reserve for possible claims and distribute the rest of the trust.\n\nWith everything that a trustee is required to do, I would not expect distributions to be made before the end of the year. If its been more than a year and the decedent's estate didn't require an estate tax return, then the trustee ought to have good cause for why distributions haven't been started. For estates that require an estate tax return, though, you might be looking at 1 1/2 to 2 years before distributions can be made.\n\nNothing requires a beneficiary to sign a \"no contest early distribution letter\" or waive an accounting.\n\nAs a beneficiary, the trustee is required to provide you information relating to your interest in the trust.

    "question": "The REGISTER OF ACTIONS for a collection case against me shows a BENCH WARRANT for not appearing at a debtor exam three months ago. The last entry is from two weeks ago: PROOF OF SERVICE - NOTICE TO APPEAR (BENCH WARRANT). I haven't been served for any of this, and I'm planning on filing bankruptcy to avoid having the business debts put me personally in the poor house. The local sheriff's warrant search doesn't show anything for my name. Do I need to go to the court?",

        "You should clear your name as to any sanctions and the warrant, even though the bankruptcy will discharge the judgment. Bankruptcy does not discharge penalties nor can it resolve a bench warrant, so you should and must appear. Find out where they claim to have served you by getting a copy of the papers related to the bench warrant and the debtor's exam showing service on you. Review the date and time and location where they say you were served. If you can prove that you were elsewhere at that time, then bring those documents to court with you and any witnesses. When you appear, be prepared to answer the questions of the attorney related to your finances and have the documents in the order to appear for examination, so the judge does not hold you in contempt. It does not matter, since you are filing bankruptcy anyway, but don't delay your filing."

    "title": "I am personally liable for not paying the CA $800 franchise tax?",
    "question": "I have a one person LLC used for Financial Services. No income has ever gone in and/or out of it as I get paid directly and not through the LLC. It has been about 3-4 yrs since I paid the $800 franchise tax. Am I personally liable for any outstanding amount if the LLC is closed/terminated by me or the State? Thank you!",

        "I disagree with counsel. When you file for the LLC, you are paying for the privilege of doing business in CA and being insulated from a certain amount of other liabilities. That amount is due regardless of whether or not your business is successful and it is due until your LLC is formally dissolved. Depending on what you were \"paid directly\" for, it is likely that you owe the tax. It will be incredibly difficult to get the FTB to back off on that.",
        "Generally you should not be personally liable for the obligations of the LLC unless it fell under the limited exceptions that make your personally liable for the debts of the LLC.\n\nYou would be personally liable for the debts of the LLC if there was alter ego liability, or the shareholder or member received a distribution or transfer from the entity that was deemed to be fraudulent.\n\nIn most cases this does not apply.",
        "No, the obligation to pay the minimum franchise taxes to the FTB belongs to the LLC, not to you the individual. So long as you do not intend to revive the LLC to use it again (or to formally dissolve it), you will not need to pay the back taxes on behalf of the LLC. Just leave it suspended."

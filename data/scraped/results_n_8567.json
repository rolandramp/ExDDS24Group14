    "title": "Unpaid civil demand gets reported to collection agency?",
    "question": "Hi, I currently received a civil demand letter from Palmer Reilfer Assoc. demanding I pay $500 within 20 days as a \"settlement claim\" for a shoplifting incident that occured a week ago. This incident occured in SF county at Forever 21 with no police involvement. I signed a paper (don't remember details) with my personal information, item stolen, etc. The item was an accessory total $15 that was recovered and not damaged. I do not have the means to pay $500 within 20 days and the I've read many posts regarding civil demands saying to ignore it. However, I have not read any posts specifically about civil demands going into collection agencies in SF county for Forever 21. So my question, will this go into collection agency if unpaid in SF county? Thank you! Sincerely, Remorseful.",

        "Any debt or alleged debt can be sent to a collection agency. Make sure you respond immediately in writing by denying liability and requesting verification of the debt and the authority of Palmer Reilfer in writing verifying their representation of the merchant. The merchant can sue you but it is highly unlikely. This is just a shake down but you were lucky you were not arrested. You made a mistake and learned from it but the merchant suffered no or minor damage and $500 is not justifiable. Usually the collection agencies get a large chunk of the amount they collect so they seek business from merchants that are victims of shoplifting to extract cash from the person doing the shoplifting. It is a kind of theft followed by extortion (a more serious type of theft in my opinion) by conspiracy between the merchant that suffered only minor damage and the collection agency that instigates the scheme to commit extortion and collect many times over the amount of the damages. In summary, make sure you respond in writing as suggested. Good luck."

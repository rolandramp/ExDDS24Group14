    "question": "My house is upside down in equity. Same as a lot of folks of course. So how does it work if a credit card company gets a judgment, records it as a lien on my house, then say, forces me to sell. How would they get paid? And if they wouldn't get paid, what happens to the judgement?",

        "The Jdgment Crditor cannot force you to sell, rather the sale is done involuntarily, rather\nIike a foreclosure.",
        "The judgment can be recorded as a lien against your property whether there is any equity in it or not. In California, if you have recorded a Declaration of Homestead against your property, then the judgment creditor cannot force a sale of your home to collect on the judgment. And, frankly, if the house is upside down, no creditor like this would want to try to force a sale anyway if there is no equity for them to be paid with. They will just let the judgment sit there, as a lien against the property, and hope the property values come back up at some point and you then sell the property with enough value left over (after the 1st trust deed and any other junior lienholders that are above this creditor) for them to get paid.\n\nAs Atty. Wrobel has correctly pointed out, however, they can always try to collect on their judgment through any other lawful means, such as a wage garnishment or a levy against a bank account or other assets you may own.\n\nI would concur that you should consult with a local bankruptcy attorney (most offer a free initial consultation) to review your entire financial situation to see if a bankruptcy might be a good option for you, in order to get rid of this credit card debt and any other unsecured debt you have. Even though your house is upside down, so long as you are current on the mortgage a Chapter 7 might work for you, or possibly a Chapter 13 if you are beind on the mortgage, but only an experience bankruptcy attorney that has reviewed all the relevant factors of your situation can determine what would be best for you.",

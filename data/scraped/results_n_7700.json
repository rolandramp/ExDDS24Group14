        "I'm not sure you are asking the correct question. A global settlement is a settlement whereby all issues in the case are resolved at one time, including the distribution of debts and assets, support matters, custody matters and any special issues.\n\nIf there are hardly any assets and lots of debt, I would suppose that the global settlement will resolve who gets which assets and who is responsible for which debt. Having said that, this is how things are handled in equitable distribution states and California is a community property state, so perhaps you would be better served by having a California attorney respond to this question. Hope this helps.\n\nEllen Fischer"

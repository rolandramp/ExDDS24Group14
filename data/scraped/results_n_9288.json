    "title": "Collection Agency attempting to collect a debt thats over 5 years old do I still have to pay?",
    "question": "A few months ago a collection agency started reporting a debt over 5 years old on my credit report and are refusing to remove it. I sent a letter asking for validation and all I got was a letter with an amount , my name and dafault date. I am not even sure if this is my account. Do I still have to pay and can they still keep it on my credit report?",
    "answers": [
        "The statute of limitations for breach of written contract in California is 4 years. If you haven't made a payment in over 4 years, there is no legal basis for the current owner of the debt to sue you. However, it is not unlawful to attempt to collect on a debt that's over 4 years old. Typically settling these old debts does not get them off your credit report, in fact, in only encourages collectors to keep going and sell the debt again to another debt collector. Your best bet is to take the following two actions:\n1. send the collection agency a \"cease and desist\" letter to get them to stop calling you and sending collection letters;\n2. dispute the debt with all three credit bureaus, you can make the representation that you don't recognize the debt and it's not yours and it should be removed immediately.\nGood Luck.",
        "The collector thinks they validated. Whether they did or not is one for the courts, but obviously it wasn't sufficient for you. Now the question is do you go to a lawyer and sue them for an FDCPA violation? Otherwise it's going to stay on your reports another couple of years, and potentially get re-aged and kept on your reports longer than is legal (or the collector will let it \"lurk\" and slap it back on your reports with re-aged dates next time you go for a mortgage)."

    "title": "Can trustee sue beneficiary for backrent when there is no lease, eviction, or collect rent? Can amount be offset from share?",
    "question": "My mom lived with her parents taking care of them until they died. She lived rent free with them (paying some bills). Trust litigation ensued after their death, accusing her of elder abuse (she was given the house). She remained in the house after they died until the court order finding her liable for elder abuse (it was bs, but not worth getting into). While living there after their death she paid the interest on the mortgage and other maintenance, no rent. She moved out after the judge's order and the trustee's request for her to leave. I am now the beneficiary, but the trustee wants to offset unpaid rent from the time of death from my share. Under what theory would they be owed rent with no lease or oral contract to pay rent? Can they offset my share for a parent's debt? thanks",

        "Yes. Trustee can sue for back rent. Mother may have offset for reasonable value of services provided to her parents, interest paid on mortgage, maintenance.\nYes. If your share is derivative from parent held liable for offset, your share can be reduced.",
        "If you were a stand-alone beneficiary of the trust, then they should not be able to charge someone else's debts to you. However, if you say, \"I am now the beneficiary,\" because your mother has passed and you have inherited her share, then you would most like take that share subject to her debts. You should probably consult with a local attorney about this.",
        "Your mother's estate is responsible for the reasonable rental value of the premises (damages) if she was guilty of forcible detainer. If your beneficiary status is through your mother’s estate, that is how your share may be reduced because, in actuality, you are only inheriting your mother’s share. Since the matter will be handled by the probate court, which is a court of equity, the judge has wide discretion to fashion a remedy for your mother’s wrongful acts. I strongly suggest you consult and retain counsel to assist in the resolution of this issue. Good luck.",
        "Are you their only beneficiary? If you are who does the trustee plan on paying the collected rents to. If you are not do you speak with the other beneficiaries. It seems that the trustee is trying to punish you for your mom's acts. If you are the sole beneficiary you could waive the collect of this debt on your behalf. Could be trustee is creating work for himself so he can bill more. You need a lawyer. lenty of us are on the Find a Lawyer TAB."

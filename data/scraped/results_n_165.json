    "title": "Can a second mortgage servicer add-on fees and unpaid payments after a bankruptcy discharge?",
    "question": "I was discharged from BK CH7 in 2011. I did not re-affirm any loan and kept my home by paying the first mortgage's monthly payment. I did not continue to pay the 2nd mortgage in the amount of $103,000(unpaid balance, including fees preceding BK). I tried to negotiate thru the years on a settlement amount. We never came to an agreement. Now, I received a letter they have transferred my loan to another company. I contacted the new servicer and they said the loan has matured last month and now they want 150,000 pay off. They said that includes, unpaid monthly payments and interest. Can the new servicer ask for such amount? Even if I have recent letters from the previous servicer only asking for 103,000?",

        "The previous attorneys have all provided you with good advice. Your best bet might be to explore a Ch. 13.\n\nOn the bright side, the holder of the 2nd cannot foreclose unless it also pays off the 1st mortgage. So, if you owe a lot on the senior mortgage, that might provide some leverage while you negotiate.\n\nGOOD LUCK!!",
        "Your bankruptcy did not alter the terms and conditions of your mortgage, regardless of whether it was a first or second or third mortgage. All your bankruptcy eliminated was your personal liability for the debt. The mortgage company can add fees, missed payments and interest according to the terms of the mortgage contract you signed. I agree that you can and should ask for an accounting but if you haven't paid the mortgage in nearly 10 years, it could easily be at $150,000. Frankly, I'm surprised it is not higher than that.",
        "I agree with Attorney Rausa. They can't certainly ask for the additional fees, but you are also entitled to a strict accounting from the new loan servicer. Take what they give you had have it reviewed by an accountant, preferable a forensic accountant. It wouldn't be the first time these guys make up fees and also double bill.",
        "Yu should demand a written accounting of all pre and post BK transactions. The mortgage survived your discharge. Sounds like 1. your BK lawyer did not do a good job explaining this to you or 2. you did not understand what your lawyer was telling you, or 3. You didn't ask about what you didn't understand. In any event, your home is worth more now than it was worth in 2011, so you're in a vulnerable position now. Sorry. You may be able to file a Chapter 13 to stave off any threatened foreclosure or, better yet, refinance your property loan to get money to fund any settlement you might be able to make with the new holder of the debt.",
        "They will have to provide you with a full accounting. Once you receive it, you may want to have it reviewed by an accountant because of the interest, fees and costs."

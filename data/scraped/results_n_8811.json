    "title": "Can I be served papers in California regarding a debt collection by just being left at my door?",
    "question": "I got divorced several years ago and a credit card in my name was awarded to be paid off to my ex-husband. This year the credit card co. started calling me regarding this balance after he filed bankruptcy. I have emailed them my divorce papers and the settlement on 3 different occasions. Each time they will not let me talk to the same person. Today there were court papers left on my door mat saying I am being sued. This credit card co. has never sent me anything in the mail, including a statement. The bill for this was going to my ex's house I assume. Can they sue me for this?",

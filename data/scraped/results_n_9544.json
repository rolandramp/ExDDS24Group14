        "Yes, assuming it is a personal bankruptcy. Also, be careful that the credit is not secured. Most likely it is not, but sometimes it can be attached to bank account that you have with the same bank or your home if it turns out to be an equity line of credit.\n\nGood luck with your situation. The above is general information only and not specific to your case - I haven't seen your paperwork nor been able to ask you specific questions. This does not create an attorney-client relationship.\n\nMatthew Williamson",
        "In short, yes, a personal line of credit can be included in a bankruptcy. There may be issues about when the consolidation happened if it is construed as a balance transfer, triggering issues of fraud, but mere consolidation is probably not a problem. Even if it is, waiting long enough will often (not always) cure the problem. Consult with local counsel to discuss the specific facts of your case. Best of luck to you.\n\nThis information is not, nor is it intended to be, legal advice. This does not constitute the formation of an attorney-client relationship. You should consult an attorney for individual advice regarding the specifics of your situation"

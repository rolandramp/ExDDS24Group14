    "question": "I bought a home and my sister cosigned. I have a disability ad cant work right not and applied for Cal ST Disability and SSDI. I am six months behind on my house payments. If I file for a chapter 13 can I put the arrears into the payment plan? How will this affect my sister?",

        "Depends on the Chapter 13 trustee in your district. You certainly can file a Chapter 13 to put the mortgage arrears in your Chapter 13 and pay them off through the plan, but the trustee may object to the plan based on your lack of income to fund the plan.",
        "Yes, you can file a chapter 13 and put the arrears into a 3-5 year repayment plan. This will not affect your sister. The chapter 13 filing will only be on your credit report. Chapter 13 is a great way to catch up on mortgage payments. After the filing you will make your regular mortgage payment plus a \"plan payment\" or catch up payment to catch up on the arrears. Assuming you do not have a large surplus of income at the end of the month or large assets then this is all you would pay and other unsecured debt will be eliminated as well. Call an experienced chapter 13 attorney to discuss your case right away. Most, if not all, give free consultations.",
        "You can go into a Chapter 13 reorganization IF you can show that you have enough regular income to cover your expenses and a plan payment. If you have a car debt it will likely be handled in the plan payment. Same is true for your ongoing mortgage payment. Paying the ongoing through the plan is not how most districts do it and I do not think the Judges have a right to force it to be paid in the plan. However, it is the only way the Judges here in the Eastern District if CA will confirm a plan.\n\nFind yourself a highly competent bankruptcy lawyer. I mean one that doesn't do anything besides solving debt problems for people. Check out ratings on attorneys here in Sacramento County. Go with the best one you can. The cost between the best attorney and the worst attorney often is $0 because they both charge the same.",
        "In order to qualify for a chapter 13 bankruptcy, you need to have an income. If you can't show that you can afford to make the plan payments, then the bankruptcy will not go through. It appears, at this time, you do not have any income. However, if you begin to receive income, then you may be able to file a chapter 13. Keep in mind, you will need to be able to pay all of your necessary expenses plus mortgage plus mortgage arrears.\n\nIt'd be best to sit down with an attorney and go over the numbers. Most attorneys will provide a free initial consultation.",
        "Filing Chapter 13 gives you the opportunity to cure the arrears through a plan over as much as 60 months. The Fair Credit Reporting Act requires that only truthful and accurate statements be reflected on a credit report. As for your sister, her credit will show she is the obligor on a mortgage that is 6 months delinquent as things are now. If you file bankruptcy her credit could reflect that the mortgage was included in a bankruptcy. Her credit would not say she filed bankruptcy."

        "As you may have discovered, the Bankruptcy Code doesn't define this. The Means Test form is designed to meet the somewhat unclear definition of this standard set out in the Bankruptcy Code, but again leaves the \"household size\" definition to census and IRS standards.\n\nThe few courts that have decided this issue are generally taking the \"economic unit\" idea and applying it, in the sense that if the child is substantially supported by you, then the child is a household member.\n\nThere are other factors and pitfalls involved here too, so you need to consult with an experienced bankruptcy attorney and allow them to examine the facts to help make this determination. Where there are potential issues related to the Means Test, as in many other possible problems that can arise with filing bankruptcy, you need to hire someone to represent you.",
        "Answer: Yes. However, completing the means test (and correctly preparing your chapter 7 petition, schedules, etc) when filing bankruptcy is nearly always worth the cost of competent legal counsel.\n\nBottom line: you would be wisest (and best served) to consult with a bankruptcy lawyer or two before trying to handle the nuances, and sometimes tricky areas such as the means test, of bankruptcy law on your own.\n\nBest of luck",
        "Yes, but if you're over median income you may not be allowed to take a deduction for child support paid and claim a dependent. You really should, at least, get a free consultation from a local bankruptcy lawyer.",
        "Yes. It would be helpful if you were also claiming the child as a dependent on your tax return, or at least every other year.."

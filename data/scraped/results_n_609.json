    "question": "Last year we had a contractor come out to our home and gave us a quote for our home repairs, our total repair cost were just over $40,000 we were told we didn't need credit to qualify for these type of loans as long as the home had equity and all my mortage payments were on time with no 30 day late payments. so after all set and done they end up putting a lien on our home for $45,000 mine Financial sititauation has change a bit and I'm just afraid I won't be able to keep up with these payments I was thinking of just filling for either chapter 7 or 13 bankruptcy since I do have lots of collections and late payments.",

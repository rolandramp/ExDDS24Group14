    "question": "So, I have more income according to means test which means I only qualify for chapter 13. Chapter 13 takes both the wife's and i income into account, even though i am only one filing. It looks really strict, and will only let you spend money on necessary items. What happens for medical expenses or copays, prescriptions, etc ? What if I take 6 months off, would it be better to file then as chapter 7 ? I have a lot of debt. I've had previous time off for vehicle accidents but not in last 6 months which presents a inaccurate picture of income. I am a retired veteran who works for department of defense so have approximately 7000 a month coming in, but was not aware my wife and child, along with her income would be penalized. I'm thinking about retiring permanently to live off my va disabilty and air force pension. Thoughts, feedback, suggestions to ask my lawyer to make bankruptcy less onerous for family ?",

        "Medical expenses are typically deductible on means test as necessary and reasonable expenses, unless they are of plastic elective surgery nature. It's good idea to get a second opinion, especially if you are potentially facing chapter 13. Your spouse's income counts but you get deductions from that total household income for living expenses based on household size, including your spouse and other dependents.

Yes, chapter 13 can be challenging, does it offer a better result than debt settlement, credit consolidation?",

        "No matter what, absent any other issue, it would be better to stop work, file ch 7 , discharge debts and then later if you decide to work some more to do so, rather than be in a 5 year ch 13 case! But you should already know the answers if you saw an attorney. But why not go see another experienced attorney to discuss. Ask the household size and what the means test income is for it. And ask :Do you take off any retirement contributions whether loan repayments, mandatory or voluntary for past 6 months and reduce the gross income by that amount? In my District our Chief Judges ruling has required that which is great as that reduces the income side so you can possibly beat it..but ask an attorney in your District. Then, even if beaten, the issue still is current income and expenses on Schedules I and J. But being in CA all income and debts are community also so you should have already known that too. THus see an attorney. OTher issues and facts can affect your case too so I will point those out next.\n\nYou need and want to enjoy your fresh start also. But the most important thing is to meet with an attorney as you asking this question means you have not. You care about 2 goals: keeping everything you have equity in and discharging all your debts. If you don't have any of the exceptions to discharge you will obtain that goal; most exceptions are set forth in 11 USC. 523 (Google it) like child support, some income taxes, traffic (in a ch 7) and criminal fines , and presumption of student loans. But some debts are dischargeable in a ch 13 but NOT in a ch 7 so you want to make sure and your attorney will discuss any such types with you also!\n\nYour exemptions depend on what state you have lived in in the last 2 years and thus if in your state, then your states exemptions will apply. Most persons filing keep everything they own but your attorney will confirm that with you when they learn everything you own and the equity thereof!\n\nSome secured debts like homes, vehicles, other secured debts an attorney will discuss your options on also as you must list any debts; but that does not mean you will lose them unless you have too much equity or are in default on paying for them! Discuss those options if they apply with your attorney too.\n\nBut other issues can arise that can greatly harm your case. Just one example: If you paid back a relative $3,000 11 months ago and now file bankruptcy next week, the trustee can SUE that relative to retrieve that $3,000 (under what is called a preference) for the benefit of the bankruptcy estate. As a result, most attorneys don't charge to meet with them the first meeting so meet with one no matter what.\n\nMany great attorneys can be found right here on AVVO in your state so look, call, and meet one as soon as you can.\n\nYou should also want to know when to file: is there an advantage of waiting versus filing now and who should you pay between now and then! Good luck and enjoy your later fresh start.",

        "By \"defaulted\" on your house, do you mean it was foreclosed on? If so, the abstract of judgment would have been an unsecured debt when you filed in 2016, and would have been discharged.

Without knowing when the actual filing occurred, I don't know whether that is appropriate. More than likely, as I indicated, the title company/credit agency looked at the public record, saw the abstract and noted it incorrectly.\nIf you continue to have issues, talk to your bankruptcy attorney."

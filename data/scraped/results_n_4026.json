    "title": "Can the IRS lein and/or levy our home for my boyfriend's tax debt when the home deed lists us as \"tenants in common\" owner?",
    "question": "We purchased the home together but the home loan is in my name only since he couldn't qualify with his credit. A few years later, we changed the deed to \"tenants in common\" with his interest being 50%. He owes the IRS a considerable amount of money (over $10,000) and hasn't filed his taxes since 2011. If the IRS were to lien the home, would this public lien show on my credit report? If they were to levy the home, would it be for his interest only? Could the IRS force the sale of the home even if he only owns 50%?",

        "Your boyfriend's lien should not show up on your credit. While it has the power to do so, the IRS generally doesn't force the sale of a person's residence. The IRS normally record a notice of tax lien so that the taxpayer's property can't be sold or the taxpayer obtain a loan on the property without the taxes being paid. The lien is only on your boyfriend's half.\n\nYour boyfriend should contact an experienced tax attorney, CPA or Enrolled Agent to see what his options are to resolving his tax debts. Resolving his tax debt will require him to file his past due returns and timely file future returns. If after filing his past due returns, he owes less than $25,000, he can set up a monthly installment plan to pay his debt over up to 72 months and the IRS will not file a notice of tax lien. If his assets and income do not allow him to pay what he owes in full over 72 months, he may qualify an Offer in Compromise wherein he will only be required to pay a portion of his tax debt or, at least, a lower monthly payment until such time as he can afford to pay more.\n\nThe worst thing he can do is nothing. If he does, the IRS may file tax returns for him, which often show the taxpayer owing much more in taxes than he really should owe. Failing to communicate with the IRS to workout payment of taxes often leads to the IRS taking more aggressive actions to collect on the debt such as garnishment of wages or levies on bank accounts or other assets.",

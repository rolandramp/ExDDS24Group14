        "I agree with all of the previous excellent answers, especially regarding seeking the help of an experienced local bankruptcy attorney, but would just like to also give you another perspective - in my experience, the majority of the time the Trustee will not ask for any bank statements at all. When they do ask, they usually ask for the past 6 months for personal and business (if there is any ownership interest in a business involved). Every once in a while you may get a request for something a little shorter. I think I have had a Trustee ask for a year's worth maybe one or two times. There has to be a lot of red flags for them to do that.",
        "It is not quite that easy. The initial Means Test is based on six months average household income. If you \"fail\" that test, it goes to a second test with income and current/future expenses (secured debt payments, medical expenses, etc). For many expenses, the law basically tells you what your expenses are (ie, a single person can't just include $900/mo on groceries because they want to shop at Whole Foods). This is obviously a VERY simplistic explanation. A lawyer can run the numbers pretty quickly.\n\nAs far as bank statements, if there is a reason a Trustee can ask for statements as far back as they want if there is a reason. In Georgia, Trustees commonly ask for a year in some cases, and the US Trustee and creditors also ask for them in some cases. If a party suspects the means test figures are incorrect, they may request statements. For easy cases in which the debtor has been unemployed for months and there are no red flags, no statements are ever requested.",
        "In Oregon every trustee wants to see the bank statements for the month you filed the petition, at a minimum; but has the right to ask for more.",
        "If we assume that you are knowledgeable in working through the means test then the answer would be yes, the means test is based on the past 6 months income. There are many factors that can affect the outcome of the means test making this aspect one of the more technical part of preparing a bankruptcy case.\nAs for the bank statements your trustee decides what to review based on what they are looking for in your case.\nWhen filing bankruptcy it is always advisable to have a consultation with an attorney if you are looking for a successful outcome.",
        "Your bank statements are generally not relevant to the means test unless you are self-employed and the Trustee wants to verify the income on your P&L to the amounts deposited."

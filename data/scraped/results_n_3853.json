        "Although I am not familiar with the statutory authority provided by the prior attorney who answered (60 days) I am familiar with California Probate Code Section 16061.7 which requires \"notice\" to the beneficiary(ies) once a trust become irreovcable (as is the case when your parents died - both on December 25 - my condolences). The \"notice\" is generally accompanied with the trust instrument which, after receipt by a beneficiary, the beneficiary has 120 days (basically 4 months) to contest the terms of a trust. During this period, if a \"waiver\" is not signed, a trustee should generally not distribute assets. The trustee should \"marshall\" assets and prepare for a distribution but not necessarily distribute outright. This is just general administrative policy that any legal counsel should inform there trust/client on. Be patient unless you really expect fowl play. If you do suspect fowl play it's better to retain an attorney sooner than later.",
        "The trustee's duties with respect to distribution are governed by the terms of trust. The trustee has certain legal duties once the trust becomes irrevocable, such as providing notification to the beneficiaries and heirs. In most cases, many months and more will pass a trustee can make any distribution because of the trustees duties. For example, the trustee will have to change title and otherwise gather assets to himself. He will also have to prepare, file, and pay debts and taxes. If you were expecting distribution after only a few weeks or months, you were being too hopeful. You may wish to personally consult an trust and estate attorney for advice specific to your situation.",
        "Within 60 days of the death of the settlor (the person that creates the trust) or within 60 days of becoming trustee -- whichever is later -- the trustee must give written notice to trust beneficiaries and heirs containing basic information about the trust and how long the beneficiaries have to contest the trust. You can request a copy of the trust from the trustee at any time, as well, if you need to.\n\nOnce the trustee provides the notice, there is no set rule on how long before a trustee must distribute to beneficiaries, if the trust even provides for a distribution. You should seek the advice of an attorney to review the trust and advise you of your rights."

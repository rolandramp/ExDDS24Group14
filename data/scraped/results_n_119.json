        "Unless the mortgage was refinanced and put in your name only, which appears not to be the case, in filing bankruptcy, he will have to list the mortgage lender as a creditor since he is still responsible for the mortgage.

        "Please note, the exemption has no bearing on the mortgage, and is irrelevant to this question.

        "I agree with atty Granvold's analysis. Your ex-husband's bk 7 will not impact your ownership of the home. He must list all of his debts and all of his assets. Since he is still obligated to the mortgage lender, they will be notified. Since he deeded the property to you 3 years ago as part of a property settlement, he no longer has any legal or equitable interest in the home and will not have to include it as an asset. If you keep making the mortgage payments, you are not in danger of a foreclosure. You mentioned you are in a forbearance plan This suggests you are not current on your payments. If you perform fully with the terms of the forbearance plan you will eventually have to resume making regular mortgage payments. If you cannot pay the payments then, your lender may legally commence foreclosure (subject to any COVID limitations).",
        "If house is provided to you in normal divorce as awarded to you 3 years ago I see no issues.\n\nYou should not assume anything at all except to meet with an attorney. What you read is true. If YOU filed bankruptcy and your house was worth 3 Million and you owed $400,000 only then you would lose it but be paid the homestead amount for example. Thus, keep paying your mortgage. You will receive as all creditors of his estate do a notice that he filed; you would if co-signor on mortgage debt or otherwise a creditor.\n\nThus, absent some issue when you transferred property to your name 3 years ago like fraud etc. I see no issues.\n\nTransfers pursuant to divorce decrees ordered by State Courts occur all the time.\n\nThe safest thing if any question is to sit down with an experienced bankruptcy attorney even though you are not filing to discuss the issues.

    "title": "Can I sue a general contractor for not paying me and other 4 subs?",
    "question": "I am a subcontractor in the construction business in Los Angeles Ca., and I completed a job for a general contractor about 3 weeks ago and he has not paid me yet. We do not have any written agreement, and I just found out that there are other 4 people that have not been paid yet either. If necessary, is it better if the five of us sue him under one case, or individual cases?",

        "With no written contract, maybe 3 weeks isn't that unusual or slow, unless there was an agreement to be paid on completion of the services or in some other time shorter than 3 weeks.\n\nHave you made a demand on the contractor for payment? You could also tell the contractor that you're going to ask the homewoner for payment, which means the homeowner will know that the contractor has not paid his subs.\n\nIf the homeowner is holding back some payments until they get inconditional waivers of liens, you could ask them to pay you directly so you don't put a lien on their property.\n\nIf there are 5 of you whose combined debts exceed $7,500, you'll have too big a claim for Small Claims court, so if you wanted to file collectively, you'd have to file in Superior Court. On one hand, 5 plaintiffs would provide more pressure on the contactor because it's a bigger caim, but on the other hand, if you filed separate Small Claims suits, it would be way less convenient for the contractor to have to fight 5 suits.\n\nDisclaimer: Please note that this answer does not constitute legal advice, and should not be relied on, since each state has different laws, each situation is fact specific, and it is impossible to evaluate a legal problem without a comprehensive consultation and review of all the facts and documents at issue. This answer does not create an attorney-client relationship."

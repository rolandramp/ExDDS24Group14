    "title": "Do I have to pay this towing charge?",
    "question": "Was incarcerated in 2012 for DUI and car was towed by police. Got out in 2014 and was told vehicle was being held for evidence, however car wasn't working and didn't want to pay anything for vehicle. In 2016 I get a bill from the tow yard for $2200. Was under the impression that the vehicle was just going to get sold in an auction and that was that. Now I have collection agencies and lawyers contacting me threatening to take legal action unless i pay the $2200. Is there anything I can do?",

        "Obviously, the sale of the vehicle did not pay all the accumulated charges. You are personally responsible for the charges not paid through the sale of the vehicle.\n\nThe SOL may have run or may be about to run. You can attempt to compromise the balance or consult an attorney to review the facts to determine if you have a legal defense. A BK may resolve the claim if you have other dischargeable debts.\n\nMany debtors just ignore all calls and correspondence and wait to see if they are sued. Above all, do not make a payment or otherwise affirm the obligation unless you intend to pay or settle it pursuant to a written agreement. Payment, in any amount, will restart the SOL. Good luck."

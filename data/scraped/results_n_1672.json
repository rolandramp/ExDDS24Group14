    "question": "I was sued by Wells Fargo Bank for SBA loan of $150,000 in 2008, and an agreement reached. JUDGMENT of $75,000 was endorsed filed at San Mateo County Superior Court on April 21, 2009. Now, SBA took in charge. They sent the case to US Treasury to collect the entire SBA loan of $150,000 plus interest.",

        "You need to gather all your documents and paperwork from the prior case, and meet with an atty who handles these types of loans/collections. The question may boil down to whether Wells Fargo was acting on its and the SBA's behalf when it entered into the judgment in court in '09, or just on its own behalf. It also depends upon what the basis is for the SBA claim against you. It could be based on a theory of liability different from what Wells sued you for.",
        "There is a federal statute that allows the U.S. Treasury to issue a garnishment summons, and garnish your bank accounts or wages directly for debts owed to the government. The problem here is whether or not the Superior Court judgment will bind the government as to the amount of the award against you. You need to consult a commercial attorney that does litigation work in federal court,because you may be required to seek an injunction against the Treasury to stop this collection from moving forward. Get up your documents, and go seek qualified counsel at once.",
        "Of course u CAN sue them. But whether or not u will win is a whole nother question. You must consult with a civil litigator...."

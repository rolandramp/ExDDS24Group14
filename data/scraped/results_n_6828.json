    "title": "EDD Fraud Overpayment Judgement in 2009 - Can I settle?",
    "question": "I was laid off in 2008 and I took a temporary job at a car dealership for 2 months that paid minimum wage. I continued to receive unemployment during this time-all my earnings were being reported to the government, it never occurred to me that the EDD didn't know I was receiving these wages. I chalked my continuing UI benefits up to the fact I wasn't earning near what I had been then I suddenly received a letter saying I owe $6000 for overpayment. I had to file bankruptcy earlier that year and did not have $$$. I requested an appeal but received nothing from the EDD other than collection attempts. I'm FINALLY getting back on my feet and want to resolve this matter but have no idea how as I can't pay in full. Can I set up a payment plan with them directly or settle? PLEASE HELP!",

        "Contact the EDD and try and resolve it. If you have the ability to pay a significant part of it in a lump sum, they might be able to work with you. If not, they will probably accept payments.",
        "While you will have to repay this debt [benefit overpayment debts are not dischargeable in BK], EDD will generally work with you on a long-term payment plan now that you have a discharge and you are employed. I believe EDD has a post-BK collections division, because your situation is not that uncommon.\n\nYou will need to provide proof of your net income and your regular household expenses [rent, utilities, food, transportation, household and personal items, and so on - similar to your Schedules I and J on your BK Petition] to determine how much you can really afford to pay going forward.\n\nYou should deal with this issue head on, because as a government entity, EDD has the right to garnish wages at a higher rate than a private judgment creditor, intercept tax returns, and even garnish other public benefits you may receive in the future."

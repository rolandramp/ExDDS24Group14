    "title": "I was sued by a law firm debt collector and need a lawyer to represent me or at trial or settle under Hyatt Legal Plan?",
    "question": "I need a quick turnaround. If not under Hyatt Legal Plan, what would be a typical fee to be represented by a defense lawyer at the trial? If I go to trial and lose, what would be typical fee added onto the balance, such as plaintiff's lawyer fee and court fee? Is the judgement final, or can I appeal?",
    "answers": [
        "Generally, attorneys will charge hourly for this, so it could be a few thousand dollars or more to handle the entire case.",
        "we handle debt collection defense cases on an hourly basis. A typical case progresses with first answering the complaint (to prevent them from getting a quick default and beginning to garnish wages or levy your bank account), we then serve some basic written discovery to determine whether they can prove the case especially with a purchased debt buyer, we then based on the discovery usually open up a dialogue regarding possible settlement at a discount. If a settlement is reached the number paid back is all you pay to the creditor the remaining debt is no longer owed and each party pays their own attorney fees.\n\nIf you go to trial which is dangerous in these cases often and lose then they get a judgment for the principal, court costs, possibly prejudgment interest and sometimes attorney fees.\n\nWho has sued you and when were you served/ How much have you been sued for?",
        "There are some attorneys that do debt defense for a flat fee.",
        "Hyatt legal Plan site lists attorneys in your area. Fees and costs vary, depending on number of factors. Need more information to opine further.",
        "Good answers above. The goal is to get out from under it so you want the cheape4st route. Loosing at trail will cost you more money generally. Try to get it mediated and settled.",
        "The fee for defense attorneys is usually charged by the hour, and depending on how complicated the case is, it could take many many hours, therefore raising your legal bill very high. You may be responsible for the plaintiff's legal fee if they ask for it either in the complaint or later by motion. No civil judgment is final in the first state trial court, which means that they're always appealable. However, there is a deadline by which the appeal will have to be filed. You should consult with an attorney in your local area."

        "As some have said, it may have an effect on certain licenses as they have a public policy to be on the lookout for hurting consumers. generally however, bankruptcy will have an effect on your credit and no matter what size you are (company wise) you will always be asked to personally guarantee loans and leases and your credit score will come into play and they may ask you about any judgments and could ask you about bankruptcy. You were not clear as to what sort of debt but either way my answer should still hold up. I would ask the licensing board about the effect on your license, and recommend you speak with a quality Bankruptcy attorney who can provide you assistance with your possible bankruptcy and do it before the second debt buyer files a lawsuit and gets a judgement further hurting your overall credit profile.",
        "If you are talking about a contractor's license, a bankruptcy could have an effect on that license. Although as long as you are not hurting consumers or customers, the CSLB would probably not have much interest in that. If you have been sued, you need to take action soon or risk being in default.",
        "Is the debt owed by the business or by yourself? If you owe the money, there is no way I can see that the debt could affect the business. In CA, an unpaid judgment to a subcontractor can result in a license suspension until the judgment is paid. Call me for further details on how that works.",
        "I don't see why it woould affect your license; but, it may affect your business. You need to talk with a bankruptcy attorney in your area for details. Good luck."

    "question": "My second mortgage was discharged $124,000 and owe $70,000 in credit cards. Have next to nothing left over disposable. Own 2 houses trying to save them both, one is rental and the other we live in. Is there a minimum you must have left over with the debt that we have?",

        "As my colleagues mention above- a Chapter 13 can be complicated and requires a clear underestanding of your financial picture AND clarity about previous bankruptcy filings. The Chapter 13 is a valuable tool if the finances permit and the household has a need for the results that can be achieve, but otherwise a Chapter 7 may be just as effective.\n\nConsult with an attorney - many of us offer free consultations!",
        "Yes, with difficulty. Chapter 13 is sometimes used to pay debt that cannot be discharged in chapter 7 (taxes, dui, etc.). here is no requirement that any % of unsecured debt be paid and often unsecured creditors get 0% in chapter 13. Look at your assets that are nonexempt - your rental house, for example. Is there equity in it? If so, you would have to pay the nonexempt value through the chapter 13.",
        "Your question presents a lot of issues that are best examined by a qualified bankruptcy attorney during an in person consultation. That said, I will do my best to explore some of them. If you are looking to file bankruptcy in order to save both homes, it sounds like you are behind on the mortgages. If this is the case, a Chapter 13 will not help unless you can afford to repay the arrearages through the Chapter 13 plan, plus keep the mortgages current going forward once the case is filed. If you qualify for Chapter 13, the amounts owed on the arrearages can be spread over 60 months, along with any other debt you are required to pay, but you must have sufficient disposable income to be able to afford this. You mentioned your second mortgage was discharged; do you mean in bankruptcy - or just charged off by the mortage lender? If charged off, you will need to deal with this as well, though the good news is underwater junior mortgages can be removed in Chapter 13.\n\nYou really need to think about what makes the most sense. If you had a sick race horse woud you keep racing it? No, you would not. Are you going to go down with the ship trying to save two homes? Why not do what you can to save one and let the other go? These are things for you to explore when sitting down with your bankruptcy attorney.\n\nThe bottom line is this is complicated - you need an attorney's help. It could be that it's not a good idea for you to try to hold on to either home, in which case, filing a Chapter 7, if you are eligible, and just getting rid of everything so you can start fresh, may be the best plan. An experienced bankruptcy attorney will go through all your options with you so you can make an informed decision.",
        "Chapter 13 is used by people who have a steady income but have too many debts to live within that income. The Chapter allows people to reduce their debt load -- especially unsecured debts -- and pay off a small percentage over the course of the repayment plan.\n\nThere are some requirements in how much you pay certain creditors and you simply have not provided enough facts to know whether you can introduce a reasonable repayment plan that meets those requirements and still have enough left over to cover your expenses.\n\nYou should talk to a bankruptcy attorney."

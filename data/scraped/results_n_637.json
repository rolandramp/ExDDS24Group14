        "I concur with all of my colleagues. You have received some excellent answers, especially consulting with your original attorney or finding a new one if you have no attorney. You need advice.\n\nSometimes, case are re-opened for the limited purpose of a creditor having to redact personal information in something that was filed with the court. That would be personal information about you or a joint-debtor or a co-debtor or all of the above. Things like Social Security Numbers must be corrected in the record at the courthouse, to keep such data secret. A Motion to Reopen always states the reason for re-opening of a case. If it is for the reason i described, don;'t sweat it. The case will shortly be closed. If, on the other hand, the case is re-opened by an omitted creditor who believes their debt should not be included in the discharge, then you will definitely need to consult with an attorney.\n\nRegardless of the reason, use the \"Find a Lawyer\" tab to find a well reviewed attorney in your locality with excellent experience. You will probably find one who offers a free consultation. God bless your efforts!",
        "When your Chapter 7 case was originally commenced, a stay automatically issued to protect you during the pendency of the proceeding. That stay terminated upon the entry of the discharge, being replaced by the discharge injunction which continues to protect you to this day.\n\nThe essential difference is that the automatic stay operates to stay enforcement of all claims, even claims that might be nondischargeable, such as priority taxes and student loans. The discharge injunction only stays enforcement of claims that were discharged.\n\nBut the reopening of the Chapter 7 case does not revive the automatic stay, nor does it limit the discharge injunction that is currently protecting you. You did not mention why the case has been reopened, but if the court has already issued the order reopening the case, you should probably confer with qualified bankruptcy counsel to make sure your rights remain protected.",
        "Atty Rausa is 100% correct. What does your BK attorney say? The automatic stay terminated when your case was closed in 2012. You have been without its protection for about 6 years. What do you think is happening that you need protection on? Irrespective of the lack of an automatic stay at this time, you still have the benefits of the discharge injunction which protects you from any discharged creditors who may seek collection of their debt.",
        "It will depend on why the case was reopened and what you need the protection for. The history of your case is also very important and sufficient facts are not provided. Perhaps it would be a good idea to contact your attorney who filed the case for you in 2012."

    "title": "Collection agency is threatening legal action",
    "question": "My son, 22 years old, single, college student, one child, unemployed, independent is being contacted by a collection agency for an insurance company. Working for a broker, he sold end of life insurance products paying commission based on the 1 year premium value with the assumption that the policy would stay in effect for at least 12 months. If purchasers canceled within the initial 12 month period, the commission was offset against future commission checks. When he was spending more on acquiring leads than he was making in commissions, he decided to quit the job. Cancellations continued to roll in so the insurance company now wants him to remit the \"unearned\" commission and has hired a collection agency to do the dirty work. What can he do short of paying the debt? He has no income.",
    "answers": [
        "The collection agency is threatening. Before they invest money in a lawsuit, they may want to find out whether he has assets or income. He should write to them, not admitting that he owes anything, but asking them to stop calling him. They can sue, but if they do, what can they recover? I suspect that they are threatening because they have no other way to collect the money.\n\nIf they do sue, he may have defenses. He has rights under the Labor Code. There may also have been some misrepresentations made to him when he accepted the job. Were they paying him as an \"independent contractor\" or as an employee? Did they wrongly classify him as an independent contractor? Should they pay him at least minimum wage?\n\nDid they misrepresent the produce, i.e., the insurance polices, thus leading to all of the cancellations?",
        "Depending upon the amount owed it may be best to make a settlement offer. 25% of what is owed is a good starting point depending upon the amount owed.\n\nBW",
        "You do not mention how much money is at issue and this could make a difference. As long as the collection companies are \"threatening\" legal action, there is no problem except of course for not wanting to answer the phone. If the amount is only a few hundred dollars, it may be that they will never follow through on these threats. However, if the amount is significant, eventually the account will be placed with a law firm to file a lawsuit. At that point there are really only 3 alternatives: having a judgment entered against him, making some arrangement to pay the debt or some part of the debt, or filing bankruptcy to get rid of the debt.",
        "The insurance company seems to be acting within their rights. If the maximum amount they could potentially hold him liable for is more than he feels he can pay without great hardship, then the most reasonable choice is to file chapter 7 bankruptcy. He does not have assets or income, so the bankruptcy should not cost him too much. Nobody wants a bankruptcy at age 21. But he will recover much quicker from a bankruptcy than running from a legitimate insurance company creditor.\n\n\n\nJohn C. Burt\n800-513-6826\njohn@inhouseattorneys.com\nwww.inhouseattorneys.com"

        "I agree with colleagues and add:\nBased on limited information provided, it will be necessary to probate parents' estates.\nYes, I do recommend you retain experienced probate council to assist.",
        "Based on the information you have provided, you will have no choice but to probate the estate. You will not be able to sell the home without Letters which is the legal authority given to you during the probate process. Using an attorney is not required but it is very much advised as probate is a long process with a lot of steps and if it is not done properly, it could cause substantial delays. I hope this helps. Best of luck during this difficult time.",
        "I am very sorry for your loss. Yes, it is worth starting a probate case. As the administrator of the estate, you will receive a fee for your efforts as well as get reimbursed for out of pocket expenses related to the probate matter. Probate attorneys are paid when the probate case is done, so it is worth your time to at least consult with a probate attorney to discuss your options and rights."

    "question": "I am suing a vendor company and its officers for breach of contract and fraud (the company is small family owned - so owner = officer). I filed in state court. Vendor company filed for bankruptcy (not officers). The vendor's petition for federal bankruptcy, motion to extend stay to officer and declaration in support (?) made statements about acknowledgement of debts to creditors and financial standing. Motion to extend stay was rejected by bankruptcy court. Can I know use the company's petition, motion statements and declaration against the officers in state court? Do I need judicial notice?",

        "I agree with attorney Chen's solid advice. I add that although the truth of hearsay statements cannot generally be judicially noticed, there is an argument that a \"judicial admission\" — an admission made in a judicial pleading — is not subject to a hearsay objection. The concept of hearsay is complicated (it confounds many law students) and what constitutes an \"admission\" is not always self-evident. Accordingly, I do not attempt to explain either here and mention them only to alert you. You should consider talking to a lawyer as it sounds like you have some complicated legal matters to deal with. Good luck.",

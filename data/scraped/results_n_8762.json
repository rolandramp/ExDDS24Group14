        "Bankruptcy is NOT the answer for you. If this is a government guaranteed student loan, then there should be paperwork for you to apply for a closed school discharge. In the first link, below, I have provided for you the Student Loan Borrow Assistance non-profit web site to the closed school page.\n\nIn the second link, below, I have provided you a link to the web page for forms from the U.S. Department of Eduction, that help you cancel the loan, such as for closed school discharge or hardship.\n\nThe proper form depends on the type of loan you have. Your lender should also have forms, if the type of loan qualifies. Go to their web site or call their help line to find the proper form.",
        "The first question is are you trying to discharge your debt as in bankruptcy or trying to eliminate the debt through civil court system. Either way you should be able to have a hearing to determine the discharability of the debts. ( It appears your lender is willing to do this by providing required documentation. Which obviously you can't find.) At a hearing you will be able to enter exhibits that will help the judge determine the dischargability of the debt. Either way an attorney should be able to help you navigate throough this process"

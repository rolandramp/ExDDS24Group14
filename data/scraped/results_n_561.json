        "First, your question has multiple moving parts and I recommend speaking with some experienced bankruptcy attorneys, I especially recommend your associate speaking with some and hopefully retaining one prior to filing his chapter 13. In short, if you are one of his creditors then he cannot pay you, i.e. you cannot take over payments, giving preference to you over his other creditors. All of his creditors must be listed in his schedules and if you are an unsecured creditor then you would be paid out along with his other unsecured creditors, So if all unsecured creditors receive 20 cents on the dollar, then that is what you would receive assuming you associate remains in chapter 13 and remains current on his plan payments. If he does complete his plan and receive a discharge then the remaining amount owed to you would be discharged."

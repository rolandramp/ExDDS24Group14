        "Section 523(a)(15), which applies in chapter 7, states that a debt owed to a spouse, former spouse, or child of the debtor that is not considered a domestic support obligation, such as child support or alimony, but is incurred by the debtor in a divorce decree or a settlement agreement between the divorcing parties is nondischargeable. This provision does not apply in chapter 13 cases.\n\nMost courts have held that what the obligation is called is only a factor to determine if the obligation is a domestic support obligation or just a debt or division of property or division of debt. If it is clear that that equalization of payment is designed to compensate one party because the other is receiving more assets, then the debt should be dischargeable in a chapter 13 unless some of the ex objects on other grounds described by Mr. Shields in his answer.\n\nTo determine whether you obligation is dischargeable or not, you should meet with an experienced bankruptcy attorney and take a copy of your divorce decree and/or you settlement agreement which was signed by you and your ex.

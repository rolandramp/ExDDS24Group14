    "title": "Will an interspousal transfer deed get me off the loan?",
    "question": "I recently divorced, my wife was awarded one of our houses in the divorce settlement. She rents the house to our daughter that fails to pay on time. I am subject to damaging my credit if the mortgage does not get paid, because I am still primarily on the loan. My ex wife does not qualify for refinancing. Will the bank recognize a interspousal transfer deed along with the divorce decree and relieve my obligations to the loan?",

        "This is not legal advice nor is it intended to create an attorney-client relationship. This information is general in nature. You should consult an attorney directly who can best analyze and advise you as to your unique situation.\n\nNo. An interspousal transfer deed only removes you from title. In the event of a default in payment, the lender will look to whoever is on the loan for collection. By signing an interspousal transfer, you are simply acknowledging that you have no interest, or that you are giving all of your legal interest, in the property to your spouse. It does not affect the loan in any way. To have your name removed from the loan you and your ex-wife would have to work with the lender to negotiate a modification of the loan (very rarely do they do this just because there has been a divorce) or your ex would have to refinance in her name alone. Until such time, not only will failure to pay the mortgage affect your credit, this property will continue to appear on your credit and will affect you every time you seek credit, such as for the purchase of another home, rental of a home, purchase of a car, etc. If you can't afford, based on your credit report, to own two homes, you won't qualify for another purchase. Many people do not realize this when negotiating a resolution of their divorce. Typically, when the courts order an asset awarded to one spouse, there is also language in the judgment that both parties have to cooperate in removing the non-receiving party from any encumbrances, debts, liabilities related to that asset. You need to look at your judgment and see what the court ordered in your case.\n\nGood luck to you both.",
        "No, an interspousal grant deed will transfer title, but doesn't affect the Note and other agreements with the lender, who will still look to you as primary borrower, to pay the loan. See the book linked below for types of CA deeds. To get the bank to agree to take you off the loan, you need to get them another worthy borrower with good credit.\n\nDisclaimer: Please note that this answer does not constitute legal advice, and should not be relied on, since each state has different laws, each situation is fact specific, and it is impossible to evaluate a legal problem without a comprehensive consultation and review of all the facts and documents at issue. This answer does not create an attorney-client relationship.",
        "My take is a little different: While an interspousal or any other deed does not relieve you of liability, that coupled with a Judgment awarding your ex the house will go a long way in showing future lenders that this was not your default, and so it may not be held against you even if it were to show up in your credit report. Most people are not taken off mortgages when they divorce, simply because they are not in a position to refinance. Nonetheless, it has always been my experience that the party who was not awarded the home could go out and buy a new one (can't say if that policy has changed in light of recent economics), despite an existing mortgage that would otherwise be included for debt ratio purposes. There should be an indemnity clause if you have settlement agreement which would allow you to file a motion to compel your wife to make the payments, or otherwise make you whole. Bottom line is: if she was in fact awarded the house as you say, record the deed anyway and do it before she defaults, and your situation will be better than otherwise.",
        "An interspousal transfer deed merely transfers interest in the property, not the loan. The lender will not let you off the loan unless your ex-wife or someone else can qualify and is willing to refinance the home with a new loan."

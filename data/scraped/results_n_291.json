    "title": "Will my bankruptcy clear my toll fines, and can I keep my car?",
    "question": "The only unimaginable catastrophic unpaid thing in my life is $14,354.35 given me by the Fastrak. I apparently was accruing these fines and only learned of it when I went to register my (now expired) registration. After two letters and full explanation justifying why I didn't know this, and how I was unaware of it, they declined to remove ANY charges. The original charges occurred over a 2 month period in early 2019 at which time I was a Fastrak customer and represent 197 toll crossings where I -- again unknowingly -- was being issued violations for each crossing. That said, will bankruptcy -- because that what it will do -- remove the charges, allow me to register my car, and keep my car through the bankruptcy? BTW did you know that Fastrak is a not a government run shop? Xerox runs our tolls and our fines and penalties are assessed at their judgement. Also, Fastrak -- or Xerox -- has been fined over $300,000 for their behavior already.",

        "I've seen large FasTrak tolls and fines discharged in bankruptcy without objection. In general, government \"fines\" are not dischargeable, so it's possible that the agency might object to the \"fine\" part of a bill being discharged. However, I've not heard of that happening although, of course, I'm not familiar with every bankruptcy case that's included a large FasTrak bill."

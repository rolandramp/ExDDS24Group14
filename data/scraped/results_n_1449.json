    "question": "My exwife went off the grid and she agreed in our divorce to take her student loans with her but has not lived up to her agreement. Now I have collectors calling me for payment since I co-signed for her when we were married. I want to sue her to take her loans but feel I need the transcripts.",

        "To get your divorce transcripts you need to go the court and look at your court file - the divorce file. Look inside the file for the minutes from the court date that the judge order that your ex-wife was responsible for her student loans...on that form there will be the name of the 'court reporter', contact that particular reporter (usually you can get this through the court's reporters list. You'll have to pay for the transcript before the reporter will prepare them, but you don't really need the entire transcript - your just need the judges order portion. Then File a Request for Order with the court and your transcripts as Exhibits - ask for the court order a wage garnishment for the loan payment amounts and then send those to the loan payments every month...also ask for sanctions and fess and costs for having to bring to the motion, There should have been a Judgment prepared and filed with the court that states she is responsible for her student loans...be sure to get a copy of that as well and attach it as an exhibit for the judge to see. The easier you make it for the judge the better off you are. Also submit the transcript and Judgement to your ex-wife's student loans and see if they will give you some lee-way. Good Luck to You.",
        "Suing her isn't the answer if indeed the student loan debts were awarded to her as part of the judgment. The legal maneuver is to enforce the judgment, seek penalties and/or sanctions and then seek assets that she has to enforce the judgment. You don't need her educational transcripts as they are protected under federal student privacy laws. You need help from an attorney who knows a thing or two about enforcement of family law judgments.",
        "You don't need the transcripts. You may need a miracle, as these debts are not dischargeable in bankruptcy."

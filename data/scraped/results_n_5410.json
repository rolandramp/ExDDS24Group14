    "title": "Is a ruling granting a motion under CCP 664.6 the same as winning a judgment?",
    "question": "With the help of an attorney, I sued one of my suppliers (I run a wholesale business) and we ended up settling. The defendant then breached the settlement, so my attorney filed a motion under CCP 664.6 to enforce the settlement agreement. The judge granted our motion.",
    "answers": [
        "No. You now need to have the court (i.e., the judge) sign a Judgment and have the Clerk enter the Judgment in the court records.",
        "You should probably ask the Judge sign a document entitled a \"Judgment\" and It needs to say Judgment is entered in favor of XX and against YY in the amount of XX. If the judgment is against more than one person, it should specify whether it is joint and several or XX just against one and XX against the other. Hopefully the Order specifies these things and you can copy the order. If you do it yourself, be patient and polite and if the judge asks you to do it over, do it over per the judge's instructions.\n\nThe judgment is a crucial document, It is the thing you spent all that money litigating for and it is what you will use to collect the money. It ends the case so it very hard to correct if it is wrong.\n\nCall the judge's clerk and ask what the judge needs you to do to get judgment entered.

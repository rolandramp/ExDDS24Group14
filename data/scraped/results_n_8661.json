    "title": "Keeping land after bankruptcy?",
    "question": "I inherited a small piece of land that is worth very little and almost impossible to appraise. It is on an island in SE Alaska and accessible only by float plane. My grandmother sold her neighboring lot during the housing boom for $17,500, and asked the buyer if he was interested in the lot. He said that my land was \"on a cliff and practically worthless\". There have been no improvements since then, and housing prices have gone down since then. Is it likely that I will be able to keep this land if I file bankruptcy?",

        "I agree with Jeffrey. I am pretty sure that any attorney you contact will attempt to get you to appraise the land. It would also be important to know what other assets you would be trying to protect/retain in bankruptcy.\nShort answer: it sounds like absent any other \"big asset,\" you will likely get to keep the land if you are entitled to CA exemptions. However, review Jeffrey's answer for things that should be considered.\n\nDisclosure: This is not legal advice and no attorney-client relationship is created.",
        "If you don't have much in the way of other property then you should not have a problem exempting this piece of property. Before you file for bankruptcy make sure you have documentation to show the trustee that the property has the low value you claim. You will probably have to have a real estate broker help you. Try to find comps.",
        "It depends on several factors. One of the main factors are the exemptions you use. When someone files for bankruptcy, they are allowed to keep a certain amount of property through something called exemptions, i.e., you are allowed to exempt and keep certain things. For example, there is a small exemption for jewelry and a small exemption for vehicles.\n\nOne of the most flexible exemptions is the wildcard. The wildcard is worth $23,250, and can be applied to anything. You can actually keep $23,250 in cash if you want. It can also be used to exempt and keep parcels of land. If the value of the land is less than the $17,500 lot sold during the boom, the wildcard would cover it.\n\nOther things need to be considered such as where you lived the past two years, the Chapter of bankruptcy, your other assets, and the list goes on.

        "As mentioned by my colleagues, primary issues in order to properly respond to your question is whether both real properties have equity, valuation of both properties, type of bankruptcy you are eligible to file (chapter 7 or chapter 13). I urge you to speak with an experienced bankruptcy attorney that handles both chapter 7 and chapter 13 to properly evaluate your options and related issues.",
        "As my colleagues have pointed out, more information is needed. The important questions is going to be whether you have equity in your rental property. Equity in your primary residence will be able to be protected with a homestead exemption (up to $75k if you are single, $100k if married, $175k if elderly/disabled). Equity in your rental property is usually not able to be protected unless it is a small amount and you have an exemption available, such as the wild card exemption to cover it. I highly recommend speaking with some experienced bankruptcy attorneys about your situation before filing any case. You do not want to end up in a chapter 7 with the trustee moving to sell your property.",
        "In a chapter 7 liquidation case, you may be able to keep both properties and get rid of all or most of your credit card debt. In a chapter 13 reorganization case, you may be able to do the same. More information is needed.",
        "If you qualify for a chapter 13 bankruptcy then you may be able to keep all your property including both your properties. Chapter 13 bankruptcy also allows you to catch up on any past due mortgage payments like the one you have for your second mortgage. I do recommend you consult with a bankruptcy attorney and hire one because chapter 13 bankruptcies are complex and have many procedural rules. There are many great ones here on AVVO and we usually offer free consultations."

    "title": "Can a prenuptial or postnuptial agreement protect 1 spouse from the creditors and bankruptcy of the other spouse.",
    "question": "Example: Marital problems exist. 1 spouse does all the earning and most of the acquiring of assets. They execute an agreement stating that certain property will be separate. Years later they are still married but separated. The spouse who does not contribute goes out and files a bankruptcy. Will the property and savings of the more responsible spouse be protected?",

        "I would suggest looking at the exemption laws available to the spouse filing a bankruptcy. Depending on the circumstances, a bankruptcy trustee may not have to accept the terms of a prenumpt or postnumpt which could be self serving. Hope this perspective helps!",
        "Maybe. I agree with my colleague that you need to personally consult with an attorney in this case. Post-nuptial agreements are enforceable in California. Your spouse's creditors, however, may argue that the agreement amounts to a fraudulent transfer, and try and characterize \"your\" property as community property included in the bankruptcy estate. The fact that you are \"separated\" may help your position in so far as the community ends as of the date of separation, but the date of separation is a question of fact and may be difficulty to determine. Again, seek the advice of counsel and don't rely on message boards like this one.",
        "My recommendation is to hire an attorney for fact-specific advice relating to your situation. Income is most often community property and thus things bought with that income are typically also community property."

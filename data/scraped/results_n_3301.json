    "title": "Should I tell the debt collection agency that is suing me that I am judgment proof? Can I put my bank on notice?",
    "question": "I am being sued for $1,100 by a junk debt collector. I have no assets, and my only income is my military pension, which is protected from creditors. Can I file a Claim of Exemption with the court, and give a copy to my bank, before they attempt to take my bank account? If my money is tied up by the sheriff, even for a few days, it could cause extreme hardship, i.e. not paying my electric bill, causing it to be shut off (it's over 100 degrees where I live), late fees for rent, unable to buy food, etc. What can I do to protect my pension?",

        "Last answer was very complete. In order to avoid the inconvenience of a bank account garnishment you might consider have your checks sent to as a paper check and then not keeping funds in the account, or moving your deposits to a prepaid card. It would still be advantageous to try to let the creditor know you are judgment proof, but they probably won't care what you tell them until after they get the judgment. If at any point you are compelled to disclose your current bank account, you should probably take one of the steps above to prevent a garnishment even if they would not be able to actually keep the funds. If you have significant other debt, you may benefit from a consultation with and experienced local bankruptcy attorney.",
        "If the lawsuit has been filed, then they have nothing to lose at this point by proceeding with getting a judgment against you. Typically, the big expenditures in a debt collection lawsuit are hiring the lawyer, filing the complaint in Superior Court, then paying for service on the defendant, in that order. If they have done these three things, then advising them you are judgment proof will not deter them from completing the process of getting a judgment against you, which will hang over you until the judgment is either satisfied or discharged in bankruptcy. A California judgment for money can be renewed every 10 years, and they usually do renew a judgment by the due date, as they have computers to remind them of any pending deadlines. The court or sheriff's office cannot accept a claim of exemption in advance, as the claim only pertains to an actual enforcement document, such as a wage garnishment, bank levy, or writ of attachment. Your pension payments should be protected, provided that your bank or credit union are aware that the funds are exempt and to not withhold any funds, if they receive a bank levy. In my experience, many banks are not aware or mess up the process, which can make the debtor's life a mess.\n\nTo stop this from becoming a problem that hangs over you for many years, retain legal counsel to promptly file papers in court and/or get the debt settled, so it does not become a judgment against you. The type of lawyer that you need is a debt collection DEFENSE attorney. The timing is within 30 days from date you were served with the summons and complaint, because after that a default judgment may be requested by the debt collection law firm.\n\nBy: Robert Stempler (please see DISCLAIMER below)\nCONSUMER LAW OFFICE OF ROBERT STEMPLER\nA Professional Law Corporation"

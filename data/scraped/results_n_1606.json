    "title": "Looking for Bankruptcy Attorney- Low Income",
    "question": "I'm in need of an attorney or clinic that can assist me in filing a chapter 7 BK. I can't afford the normal $1000+ fees that normal places cost. I'm on a low income budget. I live in Ontario, CA 91761 area",
    "answers": [
        "Every Thursday there is a \"pro se\" clinic ( for people who are filing bankruptcy without an attorney) at the Federal Courthouse in downtown Riverside. I am not sure of the exact time, but you can find it on the court's website or call the Clerk's office. However, I caution you to scrape together the money for an attorney. Bankruptcy is not a do-it-yourself project as my colleagues frequently point out.",
        "Attorneys are not permitted to solicit clients using this website, but you can use the site to contact attorneys directly to talk about bankruptcy and the fees involved. Some of us do offer low fee options for clients, and most offer payment plans.\n\nYou may need to contact a couple of different attorneys to find the right fit for you, but given the problems I see at bankruptcy hearings with cases that are either self prepared or prepared using a non-attorney, you're much better off finding a good attorney.\n\nAgain, using this site, you can contact any of the attorneys here directly. Best of luck to you.",
        "Contact a local bankruptcy attorney and explain your situation. If you are on a fixed income, own no major assets and your case is not of the complex nature, some attorneys will take that into consideration and offer a reduced fee.",
        "Many attorneys will donate time for cases like that, or at least give a quick consultation. You can also look in the court's website for the forms you will need and file without anyone's help. I would rarely recomend that you do that if you have a house as that will complicate things and you dont want to make a mistake that can cost you an asset like that. The biggest thing to consider is to make sure that you list anything of value like a tax refund, jewelry, retirement or money that is owed to you. Also list any form of income and biggest...use your common sense. If you are paying rent of $1,200 per month and make $500 per month something is missing.\n\nHope that helps.",
        "Many people that are low income do not need to file bankruptcy because state exemption laws can fully protect their assets including their at or near minimum wage paychecks. More info below. Hope this perspective helps!"

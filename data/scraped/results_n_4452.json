        "As the other attorneys said, this should have been handled but you need to either distribute per court order to reopen the estate if the bank won't deal with you anymore. Contact the probate court and or the bank for guidance and see an attorney if you run into any obstacles.",
        "I agree with Mr. Green regarding the way the probate process should have gone. That said, you don't need a probate attorney to help you distribute the money. Look at the court order - it should say who is entitled to distribution. If it is in fact the 2 grown children, and all tax returns have been filed and estate debts paid, go to the bank, get a cashier's check for each of them out of the account for 1/2 of the balance each, and give it to them. You have the authority (and duty) to do that.",
        "The idea of probate and to close it should have included the distribution of the remaining funds and wind it up... This includes the final filing of the Taxes to iRS... The final 1041 should have been filed 2 years ago otherwise you have an open estate with a valid EIN that needs to be shutdown..... I suggest you get with a probate attorney and figure out the best way to distribute the money to the two children...you should still be on the account and use the account...",
        "I agree with the three lawyers advised you before me. Good luck."

        "Yes, you can try to settle before you have to file an Answer. Most lawyers will tell you you have more bargaining power AFTER you file your Answer. If you do settle before you answer, you do not still have to file an Answer.\n\nIf you are served with a Summons and Complaint, you should first record the date and manner in which you were served, and then retain a lawyer to file a timely response on your behalf. In most instances, for Superior Court lawsuits, you have 30 days from the date of personal service to respond to the Summons and Complaint. (For unlawful detainer cases, also known as evictions, you only have 5 days from the date of personal service to respond to the Summons and Complaint.)\n\nIn the event you absolutely cannot afford an attorney to defend you, you can represent yourself \"in pro per\".

        "I would highly consider you to consult with an attorney. At worst see if the clerk of court where you were sued can help. You don't want to not answer the complaint or you will automatically lose. If you settle before the court date get something in writing from the creditors attorney saying if you pay x they will dismiss the suit. Make sure you keep a receipt that you paid. I'd start negotiations at around 50% of what you owe. See if they will break the payments over months if you have to pay the full amount. If that is the case they might want you to enter an agreed judgment entry. Don't sign anything you are not 100% sure what it is. Good luck.",
        "Yes you can settle. Contact the attorney for the party who filed the lawsuit. An answer to the complaint is a form or document that you will file with the court. There is a filing fee associated with the answer that you will need to pay unless you qualify for a fee waiver. Answers are filed with the clerk at the courthouse where the lawsuit was filed.

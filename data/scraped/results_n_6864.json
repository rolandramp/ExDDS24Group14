        "The paperwork you were given will allow you to finalize your divorce without your husband's participation. Since he has chosen not to file a Response, the Court has the authority to enter a final judgment based on what you present at your \"prove-up\" hearing.\n\nIf your case is in Torrance, I assume you will appear before either Slawson or Veasey--both very competent judges. They will ask you some basic questions -- but if you are worried then you can hire a lawyer to appear with you on the day of the court hearing. If you have children, the judge will ask you some questions about your and your husband's income in order to make a child support order. Be prepared to talk about your assets and debts and your preferred custody and visitation schedule. If there are no children and no assets or debts to divide, then the hearing is something you can probably handle yourself. I've included a link below that may be helpful. Good luck to you.",

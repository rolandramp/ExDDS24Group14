        "The eligibility rules for filing for bankruptcy are in section 109 of the Bankruptcy Code. Those sections preclude a \"stockbroker or commodity broker\" from filing \"Chapter 11\" or \"Chapter 13.\" It is clear the Code allows for individual stockbroker Chapter 7s.\n\nI assume that YOU are filing not your firm? (There is a separate liquidation proceeding for stock brokerage firms under the SEC, the Securities Investment Protection Act, which I know nothing about).\n\nThe bankruptcy code also prohibits discrimination in employment or government licenses because someone has filed for bankruptcy. However, employers can find ways around that by finding other concerns about you. Having a good relationship with your employer, and letting it know before they find out otherwise would be a good idea. I have had some mortgage brokers and people with high level security clearances file. They tell me that there is actually a bigger concern about large outstanding debt (temptation) than the irresponsibility concern of a bankruptcy.\n\nPlease see a qualified bankruptcy attorney in your area. Your case needs to be done right."

    "title": "Can they put a lien on a property that I'm a trustee on a Living Trust with but do not own that home in San Bernardino County?",
    "question": "Lost a small claims court ruling in Dec. 2011 in Orange County and in 2012 garnishments were taken out for appx. 6-8 month with an out of state contractor I was working for (Mass.) without notification (understood there's no need), however in 2014 monies were sent back to me again without reason or notification? Nothing has happened all this time (7 years) until an Abstract of Judgement was just filed April 2nd of this year 2019 by the original creditor. My credit is already in bad shape. Looking for options and just to ensure the home won't be affected that I'm a trustee on. No need to involve others. Thank you",

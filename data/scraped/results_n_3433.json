        "First, there is no affirmative duty of a creditor or collector to report an account on your credit report. That being said, the collectors have a business relationship with the bureaus, and the bureaus do not like the \"pay for delete\" arrangements as it does not allow for an accurate picture of your credit history. But collectors are willing to do it. What I would say to you is to get an attorney involved to make sure your agreement provides everything you want it to provide. Finally, no credit reporting agency will sign off on any such letter, nor would it need to.",

Make sure they will ensure this gets done within a certain time frame for your consideration (a payment?). Call a qualified attorney today. And good luck.",
        "A collection company can remove negative credit reporting information from your credit report with all three bureaus if you pay an agreed settlement. I would strongly advise you work out a written settlement agreement with the collector regarding the type of settlement- (ie. paid in full, settled for less than full balance, etc.) and include a provision regarding update of credit reporting and have them specify in the settlement agreement what new credit reporting language will be used or if the account will be completely removed from the credit report. This written agreement and proof of payment in compliance with a written agreement will protect you in the even the debt collector tries to back out of the credit reporting update. I strongly encourage you to consult a consumer protection attorney to discuss this matter and inquire about a limited scope representation for purposes of negotiating a written settlement.

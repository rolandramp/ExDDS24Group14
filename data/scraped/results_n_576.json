        "The Orange County courthouse at 341 the city drive is for juvenile and family law matters.\n700 Civic Cente Drive is for probate and unlimited civil matters.\nBankruptcy are filed at the federal courthouse. If you live in Orange County, you file at 411 W 4th st. Santa Ana",
        "What paperwork are you filing? If you are filing a bankruptcy, it gets filed at the federal courthouse check at the court website to determine where and what to file. www.cacb.uscourts.gov/debtors.\nThe court in Santa Ana has a clinic for chapter 7 debtors.\nhttps://www.cacb.uscourts.gov/sites/cacb/files/documents/dhaa/SA_bk_flyer_eng.pdf\nIf you need to file paperwork with the California State Court in Orange County, it sounds like you have an address, so I'm not sure what other information you are looking for.",
        "Are you referring to filing a chapter 7 bankruptcy? You would go to the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Santa Ana located at 411 W 4th St, Santa Ana, CA 92701. You would go to the clerk's office to file your paper work and your 341(a) meeting with the trustee would take place in that building as well. I highly recommend consulting with an experienced bankruptcy attorney and potentially retaining one if you are able. Bankruptcy is a very technical process and it usually goes much smoother with representation."

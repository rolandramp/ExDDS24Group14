    "title": "Can my gambling habit cost me my home in a divorce if habit only harms my finances?",
    "question": "Separated 18 mos. I used joint Heloc &Visa for gambling & misc items. Spouse found out -closed both lines. I have been making all payments on mortgage, visa, and Heloc. Never late I understand bad choice regardless. No accounts were opened in his name. All legal. Equity after divorce was to be split evenly-as if no debt existed, and I was going to refinance balance of house and Heloc once settlement was final. His name would be removed- he would not be responsible for anything. Were my actions illegal? and can he ask courts to award him house solely based on me using our credit lines without informing him? Both were in our names. I read about Dissipation; but he is not being cheated or losing any marital assets-what impact does this have on divorce and house?",

        "Ms. DeFalla is correct. The property will be divided equally, without consideration of the gambling waste. Then you will be assigned the gambling debt. If you spent any community assets during the marriage, you will be required to return that amount to the community as well. For example:\n\nDay 1 – married, gambled, lost $100\nDay 2 – separated, gambled, lost $200\nDay 3 - property and debts are divided.\n\nHere, the property will be divided and the total $300 of the gambling debt will be assigned to you.\n\nNo, you don’t lose the house as a penalty for bad behavior. However, remember until he signs the settlement agreement H is not under any obligation to agree to sell you the house and can force a sale on the open market.\n\nI hope you are able to get help.

        "I am not clear on the facts and, given your gambling addiction, I cannot assume that you are clear on the facts. Spouses have fiduciary duties between themselves some of which were breached by you in dissipating community assets for your gambling addiction. The remedies for breach of fiduciary duties can be loss of one's share of community ownership of an assets dissipated or misappropriated through the breach; but, that would seem to pertain to the HELoC and the Visa debts not any asset.\n\nCal. Family Code Section 1101(h) provides: \"Remedies for the breach of the fiduciary duty by one spouse, as set forth in Sections 721 and 1100, when the breach falls within the ambit of Section 3294 of the Civil Code shall include, but not be limited to, an award to the other spouse of 100 percent, or an amount equal to 100 percent, of any asset undisclosed or transferred in breach of the fiduciary duty.\"",
        "You are responsible for the debts you describe. As long as you are awarded those debts and take responsibility for them, and he receives the full value of his half share of the community assets as if there were no debt then that is a fair result. He cannot ask for more than his share just because you did something \"wrong.\" We have no fault divorce in California and no one gets more money because the other person was at fault for something. But, he is definitely entitled to be protected from your bad choices and the court can make orders to assure that he gets his share."

        "Date of default will be in the promissory note. Check your bank records to see when the last payment was made. Seek assistance from aSan Diego Student Loan Lawyer",
        "Under Cal law, the four years SOL period runs from date of last payment, date of a written promise to pay the debt, or when the loan payments go into default, whichever is later. If the loans are in forbearance, there is an argument that they are not in default, so the statute of limitations has not yet begun to run. Consult with an attorney who handles student loans for borrowers. If you are sued, hire an attorney who defends borrowers in court, do not do that yourself, it is not like small claims court.",
        "Student loans are difficult, but not impossible, to discharge in chapter 7 bankruptcy. To prevail in chapter 7 bankruptcy, you must demonstrate that payment of the debt “will impose an undue hardship on you and your dependents.” You may have a greater opportunity to dismiss in chapter 13.",
        "These debts cannot be discharged in bankruptcy. You need to consult an expert in student loan debt.",
        "You have not established that there is a four-year statute of limitation on your private student loans. Many student loans are issued privately but still have the status and protections of non-private student loans.Have the loan documents reviewed by an attorney, preferably either a bankruptcy attorney or an attorney specialized in student loans."

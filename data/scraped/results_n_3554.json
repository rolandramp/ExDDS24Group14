    "title": "Is there a Statute of Limitations for a landlord to collect a Judgement in an Eviction?",
    "question": "I was evicted from a rental property in Palm Springs (Riverside County), California, in 2005. I never paid any of the Judgement because the Landlord added \"damages\" to the amount of rent owed and reasonable attorney fees. He has referred this to a collection agency, who is trying to collect $3308.46 in interest on top of a $6980.65 balance. I thought that there was a seven year statute of limitations, and this happened NINE years ago.",

        "Mr. Elie nailed it on the head - I would recommend speaking with an experienced consumer bankruptcy attorney in your area. While a $10K debt may not justify a bankruptcy filing, if you have additional debts then it could be worthwhile. Also, many bankruptcy attorneys settle debts in behalf of their clients - which could be an option here as well. If you are working for wages and have bank accounts with non-exempt funds (wages) then I strongly recommend speaking with an attorney soon to avoid a levy.",
        "a judgment is good for ten years and can be renewed for another ten years.",
        "Sorry but the statute of limitations on a judgment in California is 10 years from the date it is officially entered.\n\nCode of Civil Procedure 337.5(b). Within 10 years:\n\n\"(b) An action upon a judgment or decree of any court of the United States or of any state within the United States.\"\n\nAnd the judgment may be revived for another 10 years.\n\nMay I suggest one of several options? If you have nothing to lose, file for bankruptcy.",
        "After a judgment is issued by the court, it is good for 10 years from the date of entry of the judgment. Just before the end of these 10 years, the judgment creditor may apply to the court to extend the judgment for an additional 10 years. The creditor can keep renewing the judgment for additional 10 year periods forever."

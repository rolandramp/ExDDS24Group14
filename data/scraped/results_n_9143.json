        "The answer to which is worse, depends on what you plan to do. If you plan to buy a house or other real estate in the next few years, a Chapter 7 bankruptcy means you have no debts at that moment (other than student loans and recent tax bills, for instance). In contrast, a default judgment usually means you have a lien filed with the county, so no mortgage lender will lend to you until your unpaid judgments have been satisfied and proof of satisfaction properly filed and recorded.\n\nIn fact, even unpaid debt collections will keep most home mortgages from extending a home mortgage loan without the stipulation of paying off those debts. While Bankruptcy lasts up to 10 years on your report, at least it does not automatically disqualify you from a home mortgage. Because an unpaid judgment is enforceable for 10 years and can be renewed for another 10 years in California Courts, it has the potential to harm your credit and make you unable to get a home mortgage for up to 20 years.\n\nIf you have been sued on a debt, you can try to negotiate with them directly. The best time is before the lawsuit, but I have a Legal Guide (see link below), that explains how to negotiate a lawsuit and some of the do's and don'ts. If they reject your settlement proposals, the back up plan is to hire a lawyer with experience defending such cases. I have been representing consumers since 1997 in collection lawsuits and it is less expensive than you think to have good representation.",

You should check your credit (for free) at www.annualcreditreport.com, to see what it looks like now.\n\nDisclaimer: Please note that this answer does not constitute legal advice, and should not be relied on, since each state has different laws, each situation is fact specific, and it is impossible to evaluate a legal problem without a comprehensive consultation and review of all the facts and documents at issue.

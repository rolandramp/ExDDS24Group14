    "question": "During the course of the last year I have taken several payday/installment loans to help cover medical and other financial obligations for my parents. I have (up until this month) maintained excellent payment history but my father recently passed in July and the I was not prepared financially and now in arrears with a few of the loans. I have tried to negotiate via email with one company but was unsuccessful, thought it might be helpful to either retain an attorney or get legal advice. I am not looking to duck out of my obligations and have already made a hardship 401k withdrawl to offset some of the payments but I can't keep up with the current payments.",

        "In my experience in hearing from hundreds of clients with these \"payday\" loans, you will not get them to negotiate to lower your payments or to reduce your interest rate. Some of them will allow you keep \"rolling over\" missed payments, but this comes at a horrendous cost in interest and penalties. These companies are ruthless and relentless. They will keep your debt growing forever until you absolutely can't pay it, then they will file a lawsuit and start taking your wages and bank accounts. I don't think an attorney can do any better than you can in negotiating with these people. Unless you want to borrow more money, they won't discuss anything of substance.\n\nI understand you aren't a deadbeat and that you want to pay your bills. But you can't afford to keep letting these payday loan companies take advantage of you. I have talked to hundreds, if not thousands of clients that have had this happen to them. Yes, you borrowed the money, but to pay it back many, many times over just isn't fair to you.\n\nI suggest that you talk to an experienced bankruptcy attorney in person or on the phone to find out whether your over all situation calls for filing bankruptcy. If you can afford to pay some or all of your debt back, with either reduced or no interest, chapter 13 might be a good option. If you are in a situation where your income just will no longer support the high interest that these creditors charge (sometimes more than 1,000% APR!) then you need chapter 7 help. You will need to provide information about your income, expenses, assets and other debts, but it's well worth the time to know what relief can be provided to you.\n\nRemember, these creditors will not hesitate to use the legal process to take your income or your bank accounts to get their high-interest balances. You should not hesitate to use the legal process to get relief when you need it.",
        "There are several questions that must be answered before an attorney can give advice about how to handle these debts without filing Bankruptcy. of course, Bankruptcy will discharge your obligation to pay these predatory loans. However, there are other methods to deal with them. First, what were the sizes of the loans? The law is applied differently to loans of $2,600 or more. If you got true \"Payday Loans\", typically $200 to $300, the law is very different. Also, are the lenders on-shore or \"off-shore\" (i.e. not loaned from America.)? Many loans originate in the Caribbean or in Canada, and they do not play by the same set of rules. Same with some loans made from Indian reservations. They will claim Sovereign Immunity\" from State payday loan laws. You need a good Debt/Bankruptcy attorney in your local area to get a free consultation to help you discern the best path to take. I would never recommend that you use your 401(k) for such a loan. That is too much to give up!",
        "Before incurring even more debt in an attempt to service these loans, I urge you to seek advice from an experienced bankruptcy attorney. I understand your desire to deal with these creditors, but oftentimes it is not possible - particularly with these types of lenders. It is unfortunate that you have taken a withdrawal from your 401k before seeking legal advice on other options - since it apparently has not permanently resolved the problem.",
        "You are trying to dance with the devil and lead. It's not going to happen. I've never known them to negotiate. Perhaps some of my colleagues have had better success. Either pay them off or file bankruptcy, and never ever use them again."

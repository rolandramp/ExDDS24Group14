        "No, it cannot be revoked for non-payment of these debts. If any debt collector contacts you and threatens this, that threat probably violates the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, for which you may be able to recover actual damages, statutory damages up to $1000 and your attorney's fees and court costs. Be sure to contact an experienced attorney who handles Debt Collection Harassment, if someone does make that threat to you to collect a debt.\n\nRobert Stempler (please see DISCLAIMER below)\nwww.StopCollectionLawsuits.com\nwww.facebook.com/SoCalConsumerLawyer\nTwitter: @RStempler",
        "No, this is not a ground for revocation of your California nursing license so long as you do not commit any unethical, unlawful, or dishonest acts in dealing with your financial problems. Do not make false statements, for example, or engage in any dubious actions or misrepresentations to evade debt or collections. You cannot be revoked for being broke. Best wishes for better days.",
        "Your license cannot be revoked, but you may be subject to debt collection calls, lawsuits and the like on your private student loans. In my experience most student loan debt collectors employ illegal and abusive debt collection practices. Some times you can even sue them for their violations. On your Federal loans you may be subject to wage garnishment and tax refund intercepts with little notice and without a lawsuit ever being filed.\n\nYou may be able to get out of default and with very low monthly payments. A student loan lawyer can often get a borrower out of default for a fraction of what the government would take from just a single garnished paycheck.\n\nKnow your rights. Knowledge is power.

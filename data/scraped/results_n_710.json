    "question": "I had two credit cards from one provider. Because of financial issues I had and two many bills I decided not to pay anymore. Now they sued me and I just received the papers from a server. What to do next? I was thinking to file for reorganization chapter 13 as I do have many unpaid and unaffordable bills. 4 years ago I had filed for chapt 7. Thank you for your help",

        "Your thinking is correct. If you already filed chapter 7 you cannot file again for eight years. You are entitled to a discharge 4 years later. So, you can file chapter 13 and based on your disposable income and assets, you may be able to pay a small payment per month ($100 or so) and then have all of your remaining debt discharged after 3-5 years. All interest stops accruing as well. Speak with a bankruptcy attorney to discuss this option."

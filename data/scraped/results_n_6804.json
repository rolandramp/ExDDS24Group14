    "title": "CAN I GET IN TROUBLE FOR A STOP PAYMENT ON A CHECK I WROTE?",
    "question": "I had gotten behind in my HOA fees to the tune of $4,000. A collection agency took over my HOA account and began charging me 35 percent interest on my debt. I foolishly signed a repayment contract with them for paying back $11,000, if they stop a threatened foreclosure on my condo. I made a few monthly payments, then i was late on one by 2 days. They wanted an extra $500 late charge. I decided enough of this, I will bankrupt all of it. If I put a stop payment by the bank on my last check to the collection agency for HOA fees and extortion payment, will I get in trouble with the law? I figure since I am going to bankrupt i dont want them to have the $700 I just sent them!",

        "While your bankruptcy will discharge your personal liability on the HOA dues (they cannot sue you, they cannot attempt to collect the debt in any way from you), but the HOA will still retain a lien on your property and can foreclose upon it.\n\nSo, if you are walking away from your home, you don't need to pay the HOA anything. But, if you plan on staying in your home, you are going to have to pay the HOA back one way or another, or they will resume foreclosure on you and you will lose the property.\n\nThe $500.00 late charge is outrageous, but I'd need a lot more information and documents from you before I could determine if it was unlawful.\n\nCalifornia Civil Code Section 1719 governs your question about the stop payment. If you have a good faith dispute, then you can stop payment. If you stop payment, I would reissue another check for the $200 difference.\n\nIt's only a crime under Penal Code 476a if you knew that that there are insufficient funds in the bank to cover the full amount of that check at the time you issued it, and you intended on commiting a fraud. It doesn't sound, to me, like that's the situation here. You should follow up with an attorney over the phone or in person for specific advice.",
        "You can stop payment. I strongly suggest that you consult an attorney. It seems clear that you lacked negotiating skills when you signed an agreement with the debt collector. You will need to hire an attorney if you want to file BK. You should talk to an attorney now, before you get yourself into more trouble.",
        "I see nothing wrong with stopping payment on a collections check, but I would confirm with a California attorney. The debt can be discharged in bankruptcy. See a local lawyer now, especially if you want to save the condo."

    "title": "Once I get past the 4 year mark with my Medical debt what do I do with collection efforts?",
    "question": "About 4 years ago I had an incident and was hospitalized without medical insurance. I have managed to avoid collections for the past 4 years. Once I am beyond the 4 year mark, what do I do to remove any collection efforts based on the Statute of limitations law? I know it is a defense but what do I personally do to tell them it is too late to collect? Is there a letter or particular wording I can use to tell these collections to not bother trying to collect on any related bills or debt on this? We are talking about over $450k in medical debt. so I feel they will continue after the 4 year mark. Any suggestions will be appreciated. Thank you, Mark.",

        "I wouldn't wake a sleeping giant by sending a letter until after the statute of limitations has expired. Keep in mind, there are powerful state and federal laws that protect you against unlawful debt collection tactics. Under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (\"TCPA\"), you have the right to tell a collector to stop calling you. If creditors and/or debt collectors continue to call your cell phone using an automated system (robocalls) AND you have told them to stop calling, each call could be worth $500. In addition, creditors and debt collectors are bound to comply with the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (\"FDCPA\"), and they are prohibited from harassing you with excessive calls or aggressive tactics. If debt collectors are violating the FDCPA when attempting to collect your debts, you would be entitled to up to $1,000. If you believe any collectors violated your rights, you might want to consider speaking to an experienced consumer protection attorney for advice. Most consumer protection attorneys do not charge for their services.",
        "I have to wonder what you mean by avoiding collection efforts. It’s possible that the statute will have run out and they will not be able to file suit against you successfully. That said, even if you can walk away from the lawsuit you cannot walk away from the credit derogatories. You should really be talking to someone about the big picture."

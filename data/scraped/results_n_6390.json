    "question": "I took out an unsecured loan for $2500.00 about 3 years ago, due to financial hardship I couldn't fulfill my financial obligation, yesterday, a sheriff stopped by my work site and gave me papers that my wages are going to be garnished, I'm assuming that my HR department has a copy as well, if they garnish 25% of each pay check, I would hardly be able to live, is there anything I can do to stop or maybe reduce/modify the amount of garnishment? by the way, the total amount owed is now $3700.00 total, thats with interest and penalties, please help, thank you.",

        "Yes, you can file a Claim of Exemption along with a Financial Statement. A Claim of Exemption is a form a debtor files with the levying officer (like the LA County Sheriff) explaining why the wages that the creditor wants the debtor’s employer to garnish should be exempt (excluded).\n\nThe forms are:\n\nhttp://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/wg006.pdf\n\nhttp://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/wg007.pdf\n\nTurn in 2 copies of the Claim of Exemption (Form WG-006) and the Financial Statement (Form WG-007) to the levying officer in your case (like the sheriff) within 10 days of receiving the Notice of Levy. Keep one copy of both forms for yourself.\n\nYour employer will hold on to the money garnished until 10 days go by and the creditor hasn’t opposed the claim of exemption, or the judge makes a decision at the hearing on the claim of exemption. If the creditor doesn’t oppose your claim of exemption, your employer will return the wages to you. If the creditor opposes your claim of exemption, you will receive a Notice of Opposition to Claim of Exemption and Notice of Hearing on Claim of Exemption that will set a court date for a judge to make a decision. If the judge agrees with your claim of exemption, you will get the money back. If the judge agrees with the creditor, your employer will send the money to the creditor every month.",
        "The papers the you received should have a case number. You need to go to the courthouse of the court where the judgment was entered. Review the court's file in your case.

        "I have linked below my blog that answers your questions on what options you have.

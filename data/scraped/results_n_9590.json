        "California law permits 25% of your income to be levied by wage garnishment. A claim of exemption allows the judgment debtor to reduce the percentage where leving the full amount creates undue hardship.

In these circumstances, a creditor may agree to voluntarily reduce the amount levied. A rational creditor realizes that, if it wants to continue collecting money, it is in its interest not to make the wage garnishment so difficult the debtor quits her job or files bankruptcy to stop the garnishment.\n\nBased on the information provided in your question, you have already tried to negotiate with the collection agency and its attorney to reduce the amount of the levy without success.

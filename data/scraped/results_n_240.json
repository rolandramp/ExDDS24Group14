    "title": "Large LLC won't pay me for the work I did because they \"filed bankruptcy\" but are still very much in business!",
    "question": "I am a social media marketer, and did some freelance work for large fashion corporation called Bebe Stores Inc. I have been hounding them to get paid from the work I did for them over a year ago. They owe me a total of $3100. They had been passing me off to different employees to \"help me\" until recently when they told me they are bankrupt and can't pay me. Is there anything I can do to get compensation? I see they keep hiring other freelancers to do the same thing I did, how can they pay them but not me? They did send me a letter to \"file a claim\" which I have no idea what that means. Their lawyers keep sending me confusing documents and I'm so overwhelmed and frustrated. I would be so appreciative of any help or advice you could offer me. Thank you so much! -Charly Yaeger",

        "REMEMBER their lawyer does not represent you and you should not expect their lawyer to give super helpful and clear instructions to you about how to preserve your rights (only legally sufficient notice, etc.). I agree with attorneys before me, that you should seek legal counsel (only if you hope to be paid). IF they are already in a Bankruptcy case, then your claim should be dealt with in the Bankruptcy case. Good Luck!",
        "In order to properly protect yourself, you really need to either read the documents you have received, or consult with an attorney. If the LLC has filed bankruptcy and listed you as a creditor, you would be receiving at least an initial notice regarding the bankruptcy filing. If so - consult with a bankruptcy attorney in your area to make sure you understand your options as they relate to the bankruptcy. If the LLC has not filed bankruptcy, you should consult with an attorney to consider whether a lawsuit should be filed against the LLC or other steps that might be taken to collect the debt.",
        "If the LLC has field for bankruptcy protection you should file a Proof of Claim (Official Form 410). This form can be located on the courts website for the district the case was filed in (Montclair would be the Central District of CA Bankruptcy Court-Riverside). Complete the Proof of Claim form and include a copy of the invoice, contract etc. that shows you are owed money. Whether and how much you get paid depends on the Chapter of bankruptcy filed and other factors, however filing a proof of claim will allow you to share in any distribution of liquidated assets or plan of reorganization if any. There are deadlines to file your claim so time is of the essence to preserve your right to payment."

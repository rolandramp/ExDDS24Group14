        "As others have indicated, a judgment creditor can renew a judgment before it expires (within 10 years of issuance of the judgment), and keep doing that indefinitely.\n\nA judgment creditor who seeks a wage garnishment can get a maximum of 25 per cent of your net wages. If your essential living expenses take up more than 75% of your net wages, you can file a claim of exemption. The claim of exemption would need to provide the court with specific figures for your rent or mortgage payment, utilities, food, transportation costs, medical costs, etc. In some cases, the amount subject to levy will be reduced, and the wage garnishment can be far less painful.\n\nIf you cannot pay the judgment, and if it is now very large due to the addition of interest, you may want to consider filing a chapter 7 bankruptcy case to discharge the debt.",
        "A judgment is renewable indefinitely as long as it is renewed before it expires, which is every 10 years.",
        "They can renew it every 10 years. You should seriously consider filing Bankruptcy.",
        "It can be renewed every 10 years, for ever. They can garnish up to 25% of your wages, but you can file a Claim of Exemption if this is a hardship. The judgment is a lien on your real estate only in counties in which an Abstract of Judgment has been recorded with the County Recorder.",
        "They can renew as many times as it takes to obtain full payment. There may be a lien on any real property, and if you were subject to a debtors exam, there is a lien on all you'd assets.\n\nIt would seem that bankruptcy is your best option."

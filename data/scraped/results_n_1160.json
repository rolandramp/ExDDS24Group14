    "title": "I need to file Bankruptcy But I just won 10,000.00 on a slot machine and I owe a lot more than that, can I just keep it?",
    "question": "I am in the position where I have to file bankruptcy, I have about 16,000 in Bills and owe 48,000 on student loans 16,000 on one car and 15,000 on a another car and about 20,000 on a car that I feel is unsafe to drive, the manufacture was talking about buying it back and now they decided not too so I am turning the car in, it is a lease so they said it won't affect my credit but I am sure when I can't pay the remaining balance it will hit my credit. Now I just won 10,000 on a slot machine and have since spent 3000.00 on food and tires for a car and taking my family to Disney land. I have 7,000 left but I feel its not going to help me escape this situation, so do I spend it on needed items and keep the receipts or can I keep it without the bankruptcy taking it from me? Do I tell the bankruptcy court I have it? Do I pay off bills with it even though I will still have to file bankruptcy? I don't want to seem like a deadbeat so Im willing to pay the rest on bills but wouldn't it go to nothing if I'm filling? I have not filled bankruptcy and I do not have a lawyer yet.",

You don't need to hide it or lie about it, but you should seek a consultation with a local bankruptcy attorney. Shouldn't cost you a thing for a consultation I know there are plenty of attorneys in Victorville that offer free consultations.",
        "Congratulations on the nice win! You are able to protect many assets when filing a bankruptcy, and depending on what assets you have, you could very well protect this money that you received. Before you do anything, I recommend you reach out to a bankruptcy attorney who can analyze your situation.\n\nYou will need to report the winnings as income for bankruptcy purposes, and you shouldn't do anything to try to hide them. First, there's not likely any need to; secondly, it's a really bad idea to try to hide any financial information from the court in a bankruptcy. Doing so can have extremely negative consequences.\n\nWithout knowing your complete financial situation (income, expenses, debts, assets, etc.), it's difficult to offer adequate advice, but it definitely sounds like you could be a good candidate for bankruptcy and that you could keep that money with full confidence that you could disclose it openly and still keep it for your future.",

        "First of all, I am very happy that you got this windfall to bless your family with a special time and to get some \"rubber\" on your car. I hope it wasn't the rotten car! There are a couple of issues you raised that needs addressing.\n\nFirst, you are not a deadbeat when you want to keep money to benefit your family. Since you needed tires, I doubt you are swimming in cash besides the slot winnings. You must be very careful with that money, however, if you plan to file Bankruptcy. You must not pay \"too much\" an unsecured creditor (like a credit card you may want to keep) within 90 days prior to filing your Bankruptcy. You may not pay back family members if you owed them any money! That is the natural thing to do, but they will have to give the money back to the Chapter 7 Trustee, and what kind of feelings would that leave your family? You cannot lavish gifts upon your family members or friends or pay off a debt for any of them. The Trustee can recover those gifts if they are too much, and what kind of gift would that be? I deliberately did not give you the prohibited amounts, even though there is a little leeway. However, I would not want you to do any of these things at all without first receiving sound counsel from an experienced, local Bankruptcy attorney.\n\nYour intuition about keeping receipts is very good. Do keep the receipts to prove where the bulk of your winnings were spent. With good counsel, you will find out whether you can keep most of your remaining winnings. You can certainly use part of it to hire a good attorney and pay the required filing and counseling fees. There are other matters that you are probably unaware of. For example, you may have income tax refunds coming that could be taken from you if you are not properly informed. if you have already spent any of your winnings improperly, most attorneys know how to legally \"fix\" that kind of problem. There is an art to planning a Bankruptcy, and timing is often the most important aspect. Many people file Bankruptcy, only to lose their income tax refunds, or lose a paycheck that they earned but had not yet been paid.\n\nI tell you about these potential problems to give you enough reasons to not delay in seeking your good lawyer. Avvo has a \"Find a Lawyer\" tab at the top of the page. Use it, and read the reviews of attorneys in your area. You want an experienced lawyer who will meet with you personally for a free consultation, who does not rely on his/her paralegal to advise you from the outset. I suggest that you get in to speak to a lawyer soon, but do not rush the process once you have found the \"one\". You didn't mention being in danger of garnishments or the like, so you probably have time to properly plan your filing. Do get all your latest creditor statements in hand, as the lawyer will need them. Get your last six months' paystubs from you and your spouse so that the \"Means Test\" can be roughly run to see if you have an immediate earnings problem that can be solved by waiting awhile to file. That is normal. You have the luxury of doing this right. For that I am happy for you. Plan on being entirely candid about winning the money and fully disclosing what you did with it. Disclosure is the key to a successful Bankruptcy; That, and finding the right attorney.

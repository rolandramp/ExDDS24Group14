    "title": "If you have an uncontested divorce and are on friendly terms, do you need to list the splitting of property?",
    "question": "I'm confused on the f100 paperwork. Is it just to get the process started, or do I go into full detail? Do I even need to go into full detail if we are in full agreement (uncontested) about the divorce? I have heard from too many people (all men) that i should list everything on the paperwork just in case my wife changes her mind about the splitting of assets and debts.",

        "Absolutely. Not only is it good practice to get it all disclosed, IT'S REQUIRED BY LAW! You must disclose ALL assets and debts, as well as opportunities during marriage AND after date of separation, that may result in income later on (i.e. you won the lottery the day before or the day after your date of separation - disclose both). Failure to disclose can result in serious consequences including loss of the asset itself and/or requirement that you pay the entire obligation. DO NOT PLAY AROUND WITH THIS ONE. Disclose, disclose, disclose. You will not be able to process your divorce through the courts unless you have filed your disclosures, which include declarations under penalty of perjury that you have exchanged all of this information with your spouse. If you still have questions or concerns about this, talk to an attorney who is either willing to prepare everything for you as a neutral mediator or talk to a consulting attorney who is willing to act within the limited scope of advising you and/or preparing your portion of the paper work. Saves money and stress in the long run. Good luck.",

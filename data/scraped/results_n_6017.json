    "title": "How do I fill out forms FL-300 and FL-305 just to get divorced finalized and get divorce certificate?",
    "question": "The clerk says everything is ready to complete divorce but case has not been closed. The clerk gave me forms FL-300, FL-305, FL-150 and FL-330. The clerk said I did not need to fill out all the forms but she did not tell me which forms. My spouse and I have already agreed on everything and all other paperwork is completed. All I want to do is Request for Order to finalize the divorce and get divorce certificate so I can move on with my life. Please help me figure out what forms to fill out and what lines I should be checking. Thank you.",

        "The clerk mis-directed you and is not allowed to give legal advice. Go to your Superior Court's Self-Help Clinic for assistance from a volunteer lawyer regarding what documents you need to prepare to finalize the case, how to complete those documents, and what to file. What would be required would include both parties' Declarations of Disclosure, Income and Expense Declarations, Schedules of Assets and Debts, Declarations re Service of Declarations of Disclosure, Judgment, Notice of Entry of Judgment, Appearance Stipulations and Waivers, and Declaration re uncontested Dissolution.",
        "None of those forms in anyway are what are needed to finalize a divorce process. FL-305 is for emergency orders, FL-300 is not generally used to request a Judgment, one can be entered with other forms that are not mentioned here. Plus, you do not disclose whether you have done full disclosures. Additionally, clerks are NOT allowed to give legal advice, so there are so many problems with this question, nothing about it is correct. Sorry.",

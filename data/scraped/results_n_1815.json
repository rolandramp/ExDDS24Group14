    "title": "Will filing chapter 13 bankruptcy stop/delay a writ of execution/notice to vacate on a home that was foreclosed on & auctioned?",
    "question": "House was foreclosed on and auctioned to a bank. An attorney has been working on a recission of that sale. Nevertheless in the meantime the new bank who bought our home at auction has been sending and posting many threatening letters and serving us with unlawful detainer papers, which my attorney has said is normal and not to worry about it. However recently we got notice to vacate delivered by the sheriffs dept civil case unit along with a writ of execution for real property, in which 24 (a) is checked off--hence cannot be appealed as i understand it. There is a move out by date of the 15th this july. If we cannot appeal it could we delay that date if filing chap 15, since the new owner would have go thru bankruptcy court for eviction?",

        "Maybe.\nRecent BK BAP ruling holds that your possessory interest is protected by the BK Automatic Stay. Reference in re Perl (BAP No. CC-13-1328-KiTaD)\nBK judge in Central District of California will likely require the owner of the real property to obtain an order for relief from the automatic stay before proceeding with lockout. This may stop/delay a writ of execution/notice to vacate",
        "In May 2014 the 9th Circuit BAP ruled in In re Perl (BAP No. CC-13-1328-KiTaD) that a mere possessory interest is protected by the automatic stay and postpetition lockout/eviction by the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department violated the automatic stay. While the BAP opinions are not binding on bankruptcy judges (other than the one that originally ruled in that case), their opinions are generally very persuasive. Therefore, a bankruptcy filing in the Central District of California will likely require the owner of the real property to obtain an order for relief from the automatic stay before proceeding with lockout.",
        "Unfortunately the filing of a bankruptcy will not stop an eviction if the landlord has obtained a judgment. If you filed the bankruptcy before the foreclosure sale it would have stopped that, or if you filed before the landlord obtained a default judgment it would have slowed the eviction process, however due to the fact that the landlord has already obtained a judgment against you the bankruptcy will not stop the eviction.",
        "Atty Gambrrel is spot on with his response. Start looking and get another place to live. You could possibly get a short delay by a 13, but the cost/benefit analysis is not favorable.",
        "In most jurisdictions, the filing of the bankruptcy would not stay the eviction if the property was sold at the foreclosure sale occurred prior to the Petition Date. There is one possible option out there, but not in the Ninth Circuit. A bankruptcy court in Texas held that the foreclosure sale could be considered a preference if the creditor that held the debt purchased the property at the foreclosure and purchased it at such a low price that the creditor will be able to sell the property and generate a profit.\n\nI have a case similar to that right now. In my research, I noted a Ninth Circuit case that said no to that argument. Thus, I don't see how filing a chapter 13 could buy you any time unless the now owner of the property elects to file a motion to lift the automatic stay simply because the owner's attorney wants to be extra careful about moving forward. That would only give you an extra 30 days, at the most, but it is doubtful that the filing of the bankruptcy would buy you any additional time."

    "question": "I plan to file for bankruptcy very soon. However I currently have a vehicle that I’ve had for 3 years now and still owe about 13K on. It carries negative equity. If I surrender it would my co-signer be liable for the payments or would they cone after them ? And is there a way to surrender it without harming my co-signers credit etc.. ?",

        "Thank you for your question. It is importantly to be thoughtful and deliberate throughout your Bankruptcy Case. And choosing to keep or let go of a vehicle is an important detail.\n\nGreat answers before mine, BTW .... I agree that, in general, $13k is not much to owe on a car these days, but the interest rate, condition of the vehicle, your income, expenses, lifestyle etc. come into pay too. A 2x door coup is generally not the best vehicle for a family, for example, or maybe you need a truck for your job (I don't know, of course). If the vehicle is constantly breaking down, obviously that is an issue that may have you wanting out of this car and car loan. Maybe you're out of work (like a lot of people during COVID19) and cannot afford the monthly payment? Are you likely (or unlikely) to have a candid discussion with the co-signor? If you are up for it, (and without knowing more), I think it maybe a good idea to speak with the co-signor who cares (or cared) enough about you to co-sign for you. If you are upside down only a little bit, maybe it still makes sense to surrender (or pay off and sell privately), if the difference is manageable.\n\nOf course you wouldn't be asking the question if the co-signor was (for example) a jaded ex, in which case (sorry), it becomes their problem. I am not arguing that you or anyone else should stick a co-signor with an auto-deficiency, but of course things get messy sometimes.",
        "Slightly different take here, assuming it's a relatively new and not a used (at purchase) car, 13K is not much these days, left, to pay it off and you may need a decent car. So, you may want to consider keeping it and reaffirming the debt and paying it off IF the payments are doable. OR even selling it now? BUT, clearly, you need to speak directly to/with a bankruptcy attorney for all issues. Good luck with it. You are not alone. Thousands of people go into bankruptcy protection every year, even more now in this economy.",
        "If someone does NOT pay the debt as it is due, then the creditor can repo it and then sell it and sue for the difference. However, if you file bankruptcy the creditor cannot come after you as your personal debt is discharged. But you cannot prevent them from going after the co-debtor unless you file a ch 13 and pay the debt in full possibly although that is not what you desire in your fact pattern. If the whole goal is to not allow them to go after a co-debtor, sell the vehicle which they will have to agree to for fmv, then reach an agreement on paying off the balance. Then, make sure you keep paying on the balance so it is not in default and then file bankruptcy quickly after selling the vehicle so you have not paid any preference payment to said creditor on the unsecured debt after the sale. You try to reach a new agreement on balance with just you as the debtor but why would they do that and give up the other co-debtor being liable? You never know till you try. The above is my only thoughts on obtaining your goal assuming your co-debtor does not file bankruptcy. Good luck.",
        "As to the effect on your co-signor's credit, there could be some effect. You might be able to avoid that if the lease balance is paid immediately.\n\nUnfortunately, if you pay the money, the BK Trustee may ask for that money back, as a \"preferential transfer.\"\n\nAdditionally, each person who signed for the loan is fully liable for the balance, so if you are discharged from that balance in bankruptcy, the finance company is going to go after your co-borrower.\n\nBest option may be to file BK, and tell your co-debtor what is coming. You return the vehicle during the BK, then after the BK is over you and your co-signor work out a compromise with the lender.\n\nGOOD LUCK",
        "Cosigner would be responsible for deficiency balance.",
        "Your co-signer would get stuck with any deficiency debt after a surrender. If the car runs well, why not keep it? I would imagine the payments are not that high if all you owe is 13k. These are issues to discuss with an attorney you hire for your case.",
        "I agree with atty Granvold and add the following: The reason lender's require co-signers on debts is because you present them with an unacceptable level of risk for non-payment. Maybe you have a poor credit score, or limited credit history, short term job or insufficient budget surplus. Whatever the reason, they are willing to take a chance on you if they have a backup person to repay the debt if you don't. Filing BK can legally excuse you from paying, but you will expose your co-signer to liability. If the co-signer is a family member or good friend, this can cause you different, but serious problems. Your co-signer agreed to back you up and probably did not expect to get stuck for your debt. As explained by atty Granvold, a Chapter 13 BK will allow you to pay the debt in full over the life of the Plan. So long as you keep making the Plan payments, your co-signer will be left alone. If you file a BK 7, you can keep making the car payments and discharge other debts. That arrangement will keep the creditor away from your co-signer.\n\nIf you proceed with a BK solution, remember, BK is more than checking boxes on forms you find online. Find/consult/hire a lawyer in your area using the Avvo feature \"Find a Lawyer\". Make a list of 4-5 having many 5 star reviews from satisfied clients. If you don't get a prompt call back from one, go on to the next on your list. Some offer a free consultation by phone or in person. Take us up on it.\n\nBecause the bankruptcy process can be handled entirely by phone, email and fax, there is no need to personally visit the lawyer’s office unless you want to. Don’t be limited by the location of the BK lawyers you select.\n\nAccording to statistics reported by the United States Trustee, virtually all non-lawyer 13s are dismissed before completion, including many that fail to even get confirmed. If you want to avoid becoming one of these statistics, please get a lawyer to help you. Good luck and God bless.",

    "question": "An unlicensed contractor installed cabinets. We paid the contract in full to the GC and the general contractor who hired him did not pay him. The cabinet guy began attempting to collect for his work from us by placing a lien on our home. We hired an attorney and he was successful in convincing him to release the lien.",

        "I can't answer about CA law (where I'm not licensed). But you possibly have claims against the collection agencies for violations of the federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. I advise speaking with a local consumer rights lawyer, who might be interested in representing you in part because if the lawyer prevails in a FDCPA case, the losing defendant can be required to pay attorney's fees.",
        "No you cannot sue for harassment, or seek recovery of attorney's fees, especially if you are going to small claims court.\nYou can sue to recover any amounts you paid him. You can also sue your contractor and/or file a complaint against him with the CSLB for hiring an unlicensed subcontractor.",
        "You can also file a complaint with the local police, and the State contractors licensing board.",
        "No, unfortunately not for harassment. You can only sue for the $1,000 if that is the amount you actually paid to this unlicensed subcontractor.\n\nIn California, it is illegal for an unlicensed person to perform contracting work on any project valued at $500 or more in labor and materials. California Business & Professions Code section 7031(a) prevents an unlicensed contractor from collecting on debts owed to them by consumers under contracts due to their unlicensed status. This means that a court will not enforce the illegal contract.\n\nFurthermore, California Business & Professions Code section 7031(b) gives consumers who have contracted with unlicensed contractors the ability to sue for restitution or reimbursement of all monies paid to the unlicensed contractor for \"any act or contract\"."

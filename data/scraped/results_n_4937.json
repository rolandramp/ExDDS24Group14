    "question": "I have filled out most of the information on form CIV-110 regarding my divorce but am stuck on one of the questions. The first question states: to the cleak, please simss my actions as follows. 1. with prejudice or with out. B, complaint or petition. Cross complaint, or entire action of all parties and all causes of action, and other. We were told we it would be a better to submit this form, and later resubmit the a new divorce because there were error on the name of my husband. We were also told that this would be better option since we had amended it several times already. Both sides agree on all terms and we just want to get this over with as soon as possible.",

        "A stipulation stating the agreement of both parties, you and your husband and your respective counsel, can change any further errors on the Petition/Response. If there is no agreement between you and your husband that you should make this change or dismiss at a later time, you can file a motion for this amendment to the Petition/Response. From my reading of your question, you did not indicate that you were reconciling with your husband. If so, just dismiss. If not use a stipulation or a motion. I would need to know the inaccuracies of your husband's name on previous petitions/responses. I would most likely amend. It is clearly the easiest, quickest, and most cost efficient way.",
        "If you want to dismiss the divorce, do it \"without prejudice.\" If you think you will go through with the divorce you can keep your case open and amend the petition to correct your husband's name.",
        "Are your reconciling or completing the divorce? You would only need to dismiss the divorce if you are getting back together and you don't want the divorce (reconciling). If you want to complete the divorce, then you need to file the final judgment or agreements by the parties on the division of assets, debts, support and any child custody/visitation and child support matters. I don't know who told you to do this but it is simpler to file and amended petition. I suggest that you seek legal assistance from a family law attorney.",
        "Courts typically keep dissolution petitions active for five (5) years and then dismiss them on their own motion after or about the five years. Some counties may have a shorter time frame. My suggestion would be to just keep it active as you reconcile, that way if the reconciliation does not work, you can put something back on calendar by filing a motion. If you dismiss the case, then you have to pay the filing fee again. So for that reason, you may just want to let it sit. Changing the name on the case can be done through a motion or by a stipulation submitted to the Court.\n\nIf you do choose to dismiss the matter, you should do it WITHOUT PREJUDICE, and check the entire action of all parties and causes of action. In fact, you have to do that if an answer to the petition was filed and the Responding party, which I believe is your spouse from the context of your question, would also have to sign the form too.\n\nI hope this helps and wish you luck with the reconciliation. If this did help, please do not hesitate to mark this as a HELPFUL answer if not the BEST ANSWER should you receive additional answers."

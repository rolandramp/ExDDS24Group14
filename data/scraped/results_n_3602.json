    "title": "I'm considering having my car repossessed. I'm upside down in the car, can I discharge the deficiency in a BK chapter 13?",
    "question": "I was laid off and now I'm unable to make the high monthly car payment. I was considering filing for bankruptcy chapter 13, once I find a new job. Since there is negative equity in the car, can any deficiencies that incur after the repossession, be discharged in chapter 13 later on? Also how long does it usually take before they'll take the car and will I ever be able to finance a car again in the future? Just FYI, I can't file for chapter 7 since I had to do this in 2009.",
    "answers": [
        "Short answer - yes. However if you choose to file a chapter 13 bankruptcy it may be more beneficial if you file the case before surrendering the vehicle. This will allow you to keep the vehicle without having to make payments for a longer period of time (assuming you keep the vehicle fully insured in the meantime). This may allow you time to save up to buy a cheap replacement vehicle or other means of transportation.",
        "You discharge it all in ch 13..when did you buy it ?? If more than 2 and half yea res ago you can p say just value of it and lower interest rate ..4.5 %interest is what I use..hide it. Save money and file then you will use at least 2 months after filing too if surrendering",
        "You should be able to wipe out the debt in a 13 but be sure to meet with an attorney to thoroughly review your finances to be sure that it is the best thing for you to do. It is hard to know how quickly the lender will move on trying to get the car back by filing a motion for relief, some lenders are quick and others take forever. You should be able to get car during your Chapter 13, but the Court would need to approve the loan arrangement. You would need to file a Motion to Incur Debt in that instance. Good luck to you!",
        "If you want to give up the car you can simply return the car to the lender at any time. The deficiency can be included in your Chapter 13 discharge (assuming you are eligible to file Chapter 13 - there are eligibility requirements such as feasibility, liquidation test, etc.) If you want to keep the car as long as possible, you can wait and see what they do. There is no telling how long it will take them to repossess it.",
        "Yes, the deficiency can be discharged after your Chapter 13 plan payments are complete, assuming you're otherwise entitled to a discharge. And yes, you will be able to finance a vehicle again in the future. The critical issue is whether you're entitled to a discharge. Section 727(a)(8) of the Bankruptcy Code states that the court will grant you (as the debtor) a discharge unless the debtor has been granted a discharge…in a case commenced within 8 years before the date of filing the petition. Timing is very important here and you should consult an attorney to make sure that filing a Chapter 13 will help. Also, depending on when you purchased the car, you may be able to \"cram down\" the balance of the note to the current value of the vehicle in a Chapter 13 case.",
        "Another potential option (depending on how long you have had the car loan and whether it was a purchase money loan) may be to cram down the loan to the fair market value of the car through the Chapter 13. You should definitely speak with an experienced attorney as timing is everything in bankruptcy, particularly in a case like yours. Good luck!",

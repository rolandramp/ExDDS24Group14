    "title": "Is there an attorney who can help me prepare a suit & request for TRO & PI in a wrongful disclosure & breach of K foreclosure?",
    "question": "The bank is going to foreclose my small business property based on ambiguous terms and a contrived technical default. They refused to accept my mortgage payments, then charged late fees for non-payment; they refused to return some fees they agreed to waive, but kept them; the bank offered me the opportunity last year to sell my property, but the Covid Shelter in Place hit & when offers dried up, refused to extend my time to sell my property on the open market. Thereafter I filed bankruptcy, but the stay was lifted and although I now have a bonafide buyer who has provided the bank with a loan pre-approval letter & a \"proof of funds\" letter for the down payment, the bank still won't extend the foreclosure sale for a mere 60 days, to allow the buyers time to buy it, so they can close escrow. Every step of the way, this bank has hindered me with a mortgage contract containing ambiguous terms with no clear disclosures and has impaired my ability to recover my business after I suffered severe illness & complications from Cancer. This bank wants to take my property through foreclosure, although I have a buyer who is ready, willing and able to buy it!!",

        "There are attorneys, I am one, who will review and even draft a complaint for you and assist you in filing in pro per (representing yourself). You will also need help reviewing your claims to know whether you should be in state or federal court.\nThe banks commit many wrongs against people, but not all our actionable and/ or winnable in court so you need to be careful. This can be done virtually and foreclosure law is the same throughout the state of California.",
        "The only foreclosure/predatory lender lawyer I know is in So Cal and is not taking cases in SF. Sorry.",
        "You probably want to hire a civil litigation attorney that specializes in real estate law. However, the Q&A site of Avvo is not the place to find this attorney, as solicitation on this site is prohibited. I would be using the Find a Lawyer search tool on this site instead. Hope this perspective helps!"

        "You've asked a bunch of questions, to which I'll give short summary answers:\n\n1. California's a \"no-fault\" dissolution state; there is, essentially, one ground to dissolve a marriage: irreconcilable differences\".\n\n2. California does not recognize lawsuits for \"alienation of affection\", so you can't \"sue\" the person with whom your husband is having \"an emotional affair\" \"for adultery\", even if your husband is having MORE than \"an emotional affair\" with her.\n\n3. California is a community property state. Unless your husband was giving away community property to his \"friend\", his 'affair\" will have no effect on the rules for the division of property.\n\n4. California courts determine child custody based upon the best interests of the children, if the parties are unable to agree as to a custody arrangement. A California court almost certainly will NOT deprive your husband of frequent and continuing contact with the children because of an 'emotional affair\", unless you can show that it has some effect on his day-to-day parenting of the children.\n\nSo, while I realize that this is extremely difficult for you emotionally, you need to start planning how to structure your life if you are planning to dissolve your marriage. This means coming up with a rational plan for dividing the assets and debts, providing for the custody and care and support of the children, etc. I strongly suggest that you talk to a qualified local attorney and start this planning process."

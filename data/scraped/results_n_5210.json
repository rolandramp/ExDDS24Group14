        "You do not certify\" a judgment. The court clerk will certify a copy of the judgment, if you pay a fee. If you want to enforce the judgment in another state, you will need to follow the rules of that state. The rules in the other 49 states are, often, similar to the laws of California. You would need to file a legal action in the other state and prove that the California judgment is valid. The defendant may be able argue that California did not have proper jurisdiction. That would depend upon the facts. If the judgment that you obtained was a default judgment, entered in Small Claims Court, the defendant may have a good argument. I suggest that you consult an attorney in the state where the defendant's assets are located.",

If you would like to skip attending the status conference, you can file a status report, which is a local form which may be found by searching for \"VN126.\" It sounds like you want to move this thing forward, so it may be helpful for you to cause a mandatory settlement conference by filing a request for one.\nBest of luck.",

        "Status conference is to determine whether the case is moving forward. Divorce cases can take a long time depending on a variety of different issues. I suggest you seek an attorney to represent your interest if your divorce contains marital or separate property assets, children, or the possibility of spousal support."

    "title": "Can child support take money out of a joint business/corporate account?",
    "question": "I am starting a business with my 2 friends. The business is located in California and is set up as an LLC. However, one of them owes around $20,000 in back child support and his personal accounts have been repeatedly \"dipped\" into. If all three of us were on the corporate account will the gov't still be able to take the money? Since we're contributing equally, what is the best way to protect our funds?",

        "Ms. Savino and Mr. Kinsey have given you excellent responses to this inquiry, and I offer only some additional thoughts, while echoing others. The LLC account, if properly established, will not be subject to a levy against any of the members of the LLC, but you should consult an attorney to assist you with the formation of the LLC, its organization and the establishment of accounts.\nOnce formed, the LLC becomes a legally separate entity, and its assets and accounts are not subject to claims by creditors of any of the individual members (or \"investors\"). However, just like any other business entity, the debtor-individual may still have his 'interest' in the LLC, or his right to profits, or his salary or compensation, levied against, although that will not reach the interests of the other members or their compensation.\nBecause of this known outstanding obligation, it makes more sense for the members to consult an attorney locally to assist with the formation and organization of the LLC, as well as its operation.\nGood luck.",
        "LLCs are treated as a separate entity with corporate legal status and therefore the assets owned by the LLC are protected. If the member owing child support receives wages from payroll, then the parent collecting child support can garnish the member's wages, but bank accounts and other assets of the LLC cannot be garnished.",
        "In general this is the type of personal issue that a formal business entity structure, like an LLC, is designed to protect against. If you had remained a partnership, there is a greater possibility that one partner's personal debts can affect the company. However, once your money is invested in the company it becomes the property of the company and is not touchable by the owner's creditors. The child support issue would instead attach to the individual owner's interest which still has the potential to affect your company in a lesser way. You should consult with a business attorney prior to continuing in business with someone who can't afford their child support. Going into business with friends can be dangerous so you should certainly make sure you have a solid Operating Agreement in place that provides for this potential issue."

        "Where is best to file depends on your personal goals - what you would like to achieve. Perhaps the information you gather here will help you decide.\n\nTo file in California, you must have lived in the state for the 6 months prior to filing, and in the county in which you file for the 3 months prior to filing. If you are both in agreement (uncontested case), you can finish all of the paper work in less than a month or two. You will not be legally single, however, until 6 months and 1 day from the date the responding spouse is properly served. She does not have to be present to do the divorce in the US, but if the matter is contested (you are not able to reach agreements/ you are fighting), you may have difficulty serving her (the method by which the court has the ability to make orders that are binding on her). You can serve her by mail if she signs an additional form accepting service by mail. Or, you will need to serve her in person (in California) for service to be proper. Again, if you are amicable and working together to divorce, this should not be a difficult part of the process. Once the divorce is completed, you will need to consult a lawyer in India to learn how to get the judgment here filed there in India and binding there - most California licensed lawyers will likely not have this information.\n\nAs to spousal support (the equivalent of what other states call \"alimony\"), there are a number of factors that impact whether or not support is warranted, and if it is, how much, for how long, and if it is modifiable. As a general rule of thumb, in a marriage of less than 10 years, and IF the court deems support is warranted, the order is generally for half the duration of the marriage. In making the decision to order support, the court does consider duration of the marriage, history during the marriage (higher income earner, child caregiver, etc), ability to earn, ability to pay, and a number of other factors found in Family Code section 4320. The legislative intent (the goal behind the laws on spousal support) is that both parties work towards being self supporting. Obviously, in a longer term marriage, where one spouse has depended on the other's income for 8, 9, 10, 20 years, that person is going to need more time to rebuild his/her career/income ability and become self supporting. Also, the court will look at need and the marital standard of living. If you both lived very frugally, or if she is living in a location where her needs are far less, the court will take that into consideration.\n\nIt sounds like you may even qualify for a summary dissolution, given the duration of the marriage. This is probably the simplest way to divorce, but neither of you can own real property and neither can be requesting spouse support. If you have no children and very little in debts and assets, you may qualify. There are a number of strict requirements, so you will need to review the rules and, possibly, consult a lawyer directly.\n\nAgain, if you are both in agreement and cooperative, this will be a much simpler process, in California. And from what you shared in your question regarding India Law, you may be able to complete the process faster in California, but I am not certain.\n\nI hope this information is helpful to you. Good luck.",
        "Mr. Benton is correct. If she will cooperate--mutual consent\"-- she cam send back a form that she has been served. It's unlikely she will seek \"alimony\" if she is not present in the US.",
        "As to which is better I don't know. But you can only file here in CA if you have been a legal resident for at least 6 months prior to filing and a resident in the county where you reside for 3 months. As to spousal support I can't tell you but I would imagine if the marriage was only a 6 month marriage, then no spousal support would be ordered. You should seek help from a family law attorney here in CA if that is the route that you decide to take."

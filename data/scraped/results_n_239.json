        "It is somewhat unclear, but you seem to be describing a balloon payment that comes due on your mortgage in the amount of $100,000.\n\nWhile you can discharge her personal liability arising from the original promissory note, the lien of the lender against your home is not subject to discharge.\n\nIf the mortgage is a junior lien, i.e., in a second or third position behind a first mortgage, it may be possible to \"strip\" the lien if the home is worth less than the amount owing on the first mortgage. This could only be done in a Chapter 13 case where you would have to make payments into a plan of reorganization for 36 to 60 months.\n\nIf the mortgage is the senior lien, it cannot be discharged as a lien upon the property.",

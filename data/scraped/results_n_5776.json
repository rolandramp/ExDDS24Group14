        "In a chapter 7 case, traffic tickets are non-dischargeable. In a chapter 13, certain fines\nare dischargeable. Under § 1328(a)(3) of the bankruptcy code, a Chapter 13 debtor who completes all payments under the plan receives a discharge “of all debts provided for by the plan or disallowed under section 502 of this title, except any debt – for restitution, or a criminal fine, included in a sentence on the debtor’s conviction of a crime.”. Thus, the question is whether parking or traffic violations are crimes in California. In California, moving violations and parking tickets are infractions, and infractions are crimes. See Penal Code Sections 15 and 16. Thus traffic tickets and parking tickets cannot be discharged in chapter 13.",
        "Debts owed to governemnt are non-dischargeable priority unsecured debt. They can be repaid in a Ch 13 plan but they cannot be discharged in a Ch 7. The automatic stay will stop collection action on them but after the case is over they can come after you again.",

    "title": "Target is trying to collect a $335 debt from me. I put the purchase on my debit card, but they transfered it to a Target card",
    "question": "I got evicted from a house. I got $18,000 relocation money. I went to Target and bought $335 worth of furniture. They told me I could save money if I had a Target card, so I filled out a form for a Target card. I put the purchase on my debit card, but they said they transferred it to my Target card. Now I'm in collection for $335, I never intended to build up more credit card debt. At that time I had 1,000's of dollars in the bank for home purchases.",

        "You have not stated a question unless it was accidentally deleted while you were writing your comment. You should have received notices and bills from Target prior to any collections. It sounds like you filled out an application for a Target credit card and they placed the purchase on the new card, not the debit card. If that was the case, they would not be able to automatically withdraw this from your account. You would have to pay it off directly. Good luck in your matter.",
        "I am not sure what your question is. If your purchase was transferred to your Target card, you should have gotten a notice of the debt and had a chance to pay it on time. For the amount of money involved, you would be better off just paying it."

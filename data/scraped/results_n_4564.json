    "title": "How long does it take to receive an inheritance from an irrevocable trust after 120 days time has passed?",
    "question": "I am receiving an inheritance but am not on speaking terms with the executor of the will. Aside from receiving the will in the mail that states that I am a beneficiary of a 'lump sum' inheritance I have not been given a time frame nor any information regarding disbursement to the beneficiaries. I am aware of the 120 day waiting period. I am currently at the 115th day. After this has passed how long can I expect to wait before receiving any further information or the inheritance itself?",

    "answers": [
        "Request an inventory and partial distribution within 30 days and if not received-hire an attorney to make the request and if not received take appropriate action.",
        "I assume you meant Trustee and Trust not executor and will. The 120 day period is just for challenges to the trust. The assets must be marshaled and the trustee must determine and pay all debts and liabilities including taxes. If the Trust is greater than $5.25M then an estate tax return will most likely have to be filed. That will delay distribution for up to 3 years or more.\n\nThat said, depending on the size and complexity, a partial distribution may be appropriate. I would recommend you cooperate and try to work with and not against the trustee. Contact and retain counsel if you feel you need protection. The Trustee's attorneys fees are charged to the trust. You want to keep the trustee honest but not be a pest."

        "You can contact the law firm that filed the lien and sometimes they will remove it without the necessity of filing a motion if you show that either the underlying debt was discharged or that it impairs your exemption in the property. You may need an attorney to do this for you as the law firm that filed the lien will usually be far more cooperative with another lawyer.",
        "The debt can be discharged, but the judgment is a separate entity & a public record, so it will continue to be reported on your credit. Unless you brought an action through the Chapter 13 to avoid any lien created by the judgment, it will affect the title to your property despite the discharge. Hope this perspective helps!",
        "The short answer is no. A judgment lien by definition is secured against something and that something could be real property or your personal property. If the lien has been recorded against your real property then it either needs to be paid in your Chapter 13, or \"avoided\" if it impairs the exemption you took on the property. If it is a lien recorded against your personal property, it should be, or have been \"valued\" in your bankruptcy to a value that you claimed in schedule B of your bankruptcy (with some adjustments), and again paid through the bankruptcy. This is a fairly confusing concept and you should talk to your attorney about the lien and what will happen or has happened to it, and if you don't have an attorney, you should hire one to discuss this matter with.",
        "Whether you file a chapter 7 or chapter 13, a judgment lien is discharged by 1) claiming an exemption in the property and 2) filing a motion to avoid the lien.

        "The debtor's personal liability on that debt would be discharged upon completion of the Chapter 13, but without taking further action the lien would not be extinguished. As a secured claim, that lien could have been paid through the Chapter 13 plan, and if so, the lien would be gone upon completion of the plan. In addition, the lien could possibly be avoided if it impaired an exemption, but that would take a motion with the bankruptcy court. If the lien is not paid or avoided, it would survive the Chapter 13, even though the debtor would have no remaining personal liability."

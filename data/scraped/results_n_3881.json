    "title": "Can Wells Fargo come and reposes furniture if I do not sign reaffirmation agreement?",
    "question": "Wells Fargo sent me a reaffirmation agreement for furniture I purchased at Easy Life. I have not paid them for over a year. They did however bring down the balance by $1500 and 0% interest. Can I keep it and not reaffirm or should I sign it?",

        "First, you do NOT indicate if you received your discharge order yet. If so, once the deadline date passes, it is too late to file a reaffirmation whether you want to or not. Secondly, you do not indicate what the actual value is. As Attorney Larkin states, they do NOT want back your furniture almost EVER. I can tell you a lot of persons in your shoes do NOTHING and end up keeping the furniture for free as the creditor does not want to employ an attorney to pursue a replevin action to obtain back the furniture. If you want peace of mind and the deadline has not passed, make them an offer on what you believe it is worth, with 0% interest, low monthly payments..If they offered $1500, counter with $600 and see what they say! Good luck. Your agreement will also need to state when the first payment is due so negotiate on that too.If you don't possess any of the furniture, or there is any damage to it, let them know also!",
        "If you do not reaffirm, Wells Fargo has the right to repossess the furniture. Whether they actually will is another question. If you really want to the keep the furniture, you should reaffirm. If you do not care if they take it, then you can refuse to reaffirm and see if they come and get it.",
        "Assuming they have properly filed the financing agreement pursuant to your state's UCC (never safe to assume they have by the way...furniture stores are not known for their compliance department efficiency), they have a valid secured position vis-a-vis the furniture....in other words, yes they can come get the furniture if they want to. Now, as my esteemed colleague observed, these people are really only interested in money. Talk to your Ch 7 attorney, it may be worth signing it, assuming the time to allow signature has not run, etc. Look, if you like the furniture, then do what you can to keep it.",
        "I Wells Fargo has a security interest in the furniture, you will either need to surrender the furniture back to them, redeem the furniture (keep it and pay the fair market value to Wells Fargo in one lump sum, and sign a redemption agreement), or reaffirm the debt. As a practical matter, most such creditors are not really interested in the furniture - they want your money."

    "question": "My husband passed away suddenly last year leaving me with almost $60,000 in credit card debt (There was no will, and he had no assets). With my own debts weighing down, I had no choice but to file for bankruptcy for myself. On the list of creditors, I also included my husband's debts as well. Recently I was discharged.",

        "The amount is small and most likely exempt anyway. However, the problem is that property not reported in the petition remains in the bankruptcy estate and it is not yours unless exempt or abandoned by the trustee. Reopening the bankruptcy case is costly because there is a fee and you need a lawyer to file a motion. If you had a bankruptcy lawyer then you must consult with your attorney and file his/her advice of course. However, one alternative so you do not get in trouble is to report to the trustee in writing that your recently discover the money. If the trustee feels he/she can take the money the the trustee will reopen the case. You can then amend the exemption schedule to claim the IRA money exempt. If the trustee sees that the money can be exempted he/she will not bother to reopen the case and after a reasonable time (probably at least 90 days) you can assume the trustee has, in effect, abandoned the funds and then use the funds as needed. What I am suggesting is not technically what the law requires but the law must also be practical given the small amount involved, that it would be exempt and that your reported it to the trustee promptly and that shows that you are acting in good faith. Also, California has a procedure that allows you to obtain the funds without an expensive and long probate since it is only $4,000. You need to do a declaration stating that as the wife you are entitled to the funds because it is community property and that you are the legal spouse. A lawyer should do that and the fee should be about $200. Good luck.",
        "You have posed a sticky question. Bankruptcy law says that if a person inherits property within 6 months (180 days) of filing for bankruptcy, the petitioner must inform the trustee. I take it that it has been longer than 6 months since you filed. But you may (or may not) have been entitled to inherit this $4000 at the time you filed. You did not know about it at the time and you have done nothing wrong. But do you have to report it now? Technically you still haven't inherited it. Since you are not named as beneficiary on the account and there is no will, you would have to be declared to be the heir by a court. That's why you need to get letters testamentary from the court. You may not even be entitled to all of the $4000. Do you have any children? What does California law say about sharing the estate between spouse and children?\n\nThen there is the issue of your husband's debts. You say that you declared bankruptcy because of his debts. Unless you were a joint debtor on the credit cards, you are not liable for your spouses separate debts and you cannot have them discharged because you list them in your bankruptcy as though you owe them. Which leads to the next part of this sticky question.\n\nDepending on CA law, your husband's estate is liable for his debts. Theoretically you should be turning the $4000 over to his creditors.

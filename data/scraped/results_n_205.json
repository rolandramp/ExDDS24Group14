    "title": "In California Chapter 7 Bankruptcy. Sued for copyright infringement. If they don't file anything by ch. 7 deadline am I safe?",
    "question": "So I was sued for copyright infringement. The case is ongoing / no verdict or judgment yet. I read that they want to say it was \"willful and malicious\" and I believe that that could make it not discharged in bankruptcy. However, the case is ongoing. So if I file chapter 7 and it dismisses the underlying federal case, what are the options of this creditor?",

    "answers": [
        "Discharge determinations based on copyright infringement are typically brought under 11 USC 523(a)(6), the \"willful and malicious injury\" exception that you mentioned. Those actions must be brought (i.e. a complaint filed in the bankruptcy case) by the stated deadline (60 days following the initial date set for the meeting of creditors). If the creditor does not file a complaint objecting to discharge by that date, and you receive your discharge, then that ends the rights of the copyright infringement creditor and the underlying case must be dismissed. This assumes the creditor properly received notice of the bankruptcy filing (i.e. the address was correct, etc.).",
        "Assuming the creditor was properly noticed, the creditor must file a complaint objecting to your discharge by the deadline to file (60 days from the initial 341a meeting). If they fail to file timely, the nondischargeability claim is forever waived. The nondischargeability case would also proceed in the bankruptcy court and not the underlying case as the bankruptcy court has exclusive jurisdiction in 523 nondischargeability adversary proceedings.\n\nWith respect to attorney's fees, the prevailing party can recover attorney's fees if there is an applicable contract that includes such a provision or fees are recoverable by statute. You should consult with a bankruptcy attorney with significant experience litigating 523 nondischargeability adversary proceedings.",
        "If you file a chapter 7 and list the person who sued you as one of your creditors, the bankruptcy court would then have jurisdiction over that creditor's claim. The filing of a bankruptcy case will \"stay\" the copyright case, and it would not proceed until the stay is \"lifted\" or the bankruptcy case is concluded. If the court issues a discharge of all your debts, the creditor would have to dismiss its case. A discharge in bankruptcy is a complete defense.\n\nHowever, if plaintiff wants to argue that the debt is not dischargeable in bankruptcy, he or she would have to file an adversary complaint (lawsuit in the bankruptcy court) to make the argument that the damages sought by the copyright case are not dischargeable. In order to understand the possible outcomes, and cost of litigating that issue, you should consult with a bankruptcy attorney, someone who has litigated adversary complaint such as the one you anticipate would be filed.",
        "If you file the bankruptcy petition (whichever chapter), make sure to list the creditor address and address for the creditor's attorney so there is no doubt the creditor was served with all notices from the bankruptcy court.\n\nOf course you will also file a notice of stay in the court where the litigation is pending.\n\nBut your bankruptcy petition will not \"dismiss\" the ongoing litigation; it will only stay it pending the creditor's option to seek the determination from the bankruptcy court that the debt is nondischargeable, and the creditor may even seek relief from stay to continue the litigation pending entry or denial of your discharge.",
        "Mr. Markus has the correct answer. If you file bankruptcy mid-way, the \"creditor,\" if it elects to do so, can file an adversary proceeding within the bankruptcy and \"continue\" their lawsuit within the bankruptcy case and prove non-dischargeability - if applicable."

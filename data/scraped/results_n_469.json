        "Assuming that you received a discharge a discharge in the prior Chapter 7 case, you would be eligible to file a subsequent Chapter 7 case eight years and one day after the date on which you filed the earlier case.\n\nYou would be eligible to file a Chapter 13 case in which you would be granted a discharge even if you paid less than 100% of the creditor claims if you await four years and one day after the filing date of the earlier case. This would be what is called a \"full discharge Chapter 13\".\n\nAnd even if neither four years or eight years have run, you are still eligible to file a Chapter 13 case, but there would be no discharge granted. This would be what is called a \"non-discharging Chapter 13\".

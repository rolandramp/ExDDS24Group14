    "title": "Can an abstract judgment for a judgment default be dismissed with Chapter 7 BK, and can they levy my bank acct as well?",
    "question": "I had a credit card co (their law firm) receive a default judgment against me, even though I had paid an attorney to file a response. All he did was make a phone call telling them I was filing bk at some point. Of course, they got the default judgment last year. What's done is done. Now they have filed an abstract judgment against my home. Two questions - can they still try to levy my bank account as well (my income is all disability). Second, can the abstract judgment be removed by filing Chapter 7 BK?",
    "answers": [
        "The most complete way to get relief from this debt and the lien (other than paying it off) is by filing for bankruptcy protection. It appears you would qualify for Chapter 7. To take care of both the debt and the lien will require filing the petition and then filing a motion to avoid the lien. The motion will be granted if your equity is less than your available exemption amount. Although you may be able to protect your social security income from creditors outside of bankruptcy, there is no way to avoid the lien except in Bankruptcy.",
        "Bankruptcy does not dismiss debts or liens, it discharges debts. Although the two terms are similar & sound nearly the same, their legal affect is quite different. Bankruptcy will not remove a judgment from your credit report. It will take additional effort & cost an additional fee to remove a judgment lien during a bankruptcy. Although a judgment creditor can attempt to levy your bank account, you will want to determine if the money in the account is exempt or not. Social security disability would be exempt, but you didn't specify the source of your disability income. I am providing a link to a general description of the exemptions available in all 50 states for you to review. California has two exemption formulas, one is only available when you file bankruptcy & the other could be used now to protect you from a creditor seeking to collect. Hope this perspective helps!",

        "Ms. Brewer gave you the long version. In the end, your mother's debts will have to be paid from her estate to the extent assets are available to do this. You will not be able to get around it, however more facts would be helpful as she points out.",
        "I'm very sorry about your mother's death.\n\nEither Mr. Garner did not read your question carefully or he does not know California probate laws.\n\nYou state that your house is in your mother's name. My first question is whether it is in her name alone or if she owned it in \"joint tenancy\" with someone else (your father or you). If so, it will pass to the surviving joint tenant(s) without having to go through probate.\n\nIf she owned it as \"community property\" with your father, someone will need to initiate a \"Spousal Property Petition\" in the probate court to have the house retitled into his name. If the house was in her name alone or if she owned it as a \"tenant-in-common\" with someone else, then someone will need to initiate a full probate proceeding to have it retitled into the names of her heirs.\n\nBased on what you've said, it sounds like there's approximately $300,000 in debt on the house ($100K mortgage plus $200K line of credit), plus her credit cards and other debts.\n\nDepending on a number of factors that are too complicated to discuss in a forum like this, someone will need to repay the debt - probably your father, if the debt would be considered \"community property\" debt.\n\nIf the house has to go through a full probate, the creditors can look to the equity in the house for repayment of the debt if there are no other assets that can be used to repay them (so it could be necessary to sell the house in order to satisfy the debts if there’s no other way to pay them).\n\nIf your mother has a will or a trust that leaves the house to you, then you will inherit the house subject to the mortgage and the line of credit and you will be responsible for repaying those items (the \"good news\" is there’s a federal law called the “Garns St. Germain Act” that prohibits the mortgage company from forcing you to refinance the house as long as you keep making the mortgage payments).\n\nYou need to contact a knowledgeable probate lawyer as soon as possible to determine the best course of action in this matter.\n\nGood luck.\n\nThis information is not intended to substitute for professional legal advice and does not create an attorney-client relationship. You should accept legal advice only from a licensed legal professional with whom you have an attorney-client relationship.",
        "First let me say I am very sorry for your loss.\n\nIn California, when a person with no assets passes away, the family members (other than a spouse) are typically not responsible for the debt owed by the deceased.\n\nThat said, you have stated that your mother had assets (a home and a business). If your mom had assets, then the creditors after being informed of her passing will have a right to seek attachment of those assets to repay the debts.\n\nThere are many issues here that cannot be addressed in this forum due to a lack of specificity. For example, was your mother still married when she passed away? Was your mother's clothing business incorporated? The home appears to have $300,000 in mortage/debt and that may require a re-finance, or the assumption of the debt by your father (if he was still married to your mother).\n\nI strongly advise the questioner to consult with an attorney to thoroughly review his or her particular circumstances and for advice tailored to his or her specific circumstances.\n\nDisclaimer. Ms. Marsh is an attorney licensed to practice in California. The information posted above is for general information, does not constitute professional legal advice, and does not create an attorney client relationship.",
        "The good news: You and your family will not be liable to repay any debts she has. If the resources she left were insufficient to cover them then the creditors are out of luck.\n\nThe bad news: Creditors can reach the house and any equity therein. In addition, since California is a community property state, creditors can reach any community property assets as well in seeking satisfaction of this debt.\n\nI would talk with a probate attorney immediately."

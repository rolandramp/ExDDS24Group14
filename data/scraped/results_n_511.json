    "title": "What do creditors need to do when collecting on their judgements in California?",
    "question": "I have a discharged Chapter 7 bankruptcy from 2013 which was filed in 2012, I am not sure if it's from filing date or discharge date that you can refile. However, I used very poor judgement as I got sicker while trying to run my own business and ran up a lot more debt that I was unable to pay back. So I have several judgements that have been filed with the court.",
    "answers": [
        "I agree with the response of my colleague atty Firth. That said, only real estate is considered \"real property\". Vehicles are considered \"personal property\". That said, it is unlikely any creditor who sues you would actually be able to collect on its judgment. The filing dates are 8 yrs and 1 day apart. The date of the filing is date to use. Concentrate on your health issues. To the extent that debts adversely impact your recovery, you will have to let that go.",
        "If you go back to work, the judgment creditors can garnish your paycheck or levy your bank account. You can file another chapter 7 eight years from the date of filing the previous one. You can file a chapter 13 four years from the date of filing a chapter 7. I suggest that you work with a bankruptcy attorney to see if you can put together a minimal plan to get the creditors off your back until the eight year anniversary of the chapter 7 filing. Then you can convert to a chapter 7."

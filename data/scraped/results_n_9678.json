        "Mr. Mashal is correct. You may not be able to redeem the store credit...it may be lost forever if the company that provided it went out of business and is in bankruptcy. As Mr. mashal correctly stated, you can file a \"proof of claim\" in their bankruptcy case, but it may cost more than its worth.\n\nHowever, if the store closed but there are others, or if it is owned by a parent company, you may be able to still redeem that credit. You will need to research the company.\n\nDisclaimer. Ms. Marsh is an attorney licensed to practice in California.

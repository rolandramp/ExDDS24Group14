    "title": "My father-in-law passed away with credit card debt. Debt collectors are now hounding my wife for payment. Do we have to pay?",
    "question": "My wife was left as trustee. Upon death, my father-in-law had no money due to expenses to care for him in hospice. We tried working with the bank before passing because my FIL was coerced into opening the account by some \"friends\". At the time of opening the account, we did not know that my FIL had brain cancer which the doctor believe may have affected judgment. The bank did not want to work with us in relieving the debt even though we gave them the names and number of the \"friends\". The bank also didn't care to hear about the possibility of the cancer affecting judgment. Are we obligated to pay this debt?",

        "In addition to the answers from the other attorneys, I can't help but wonder if the callers are violating the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (\"TCPA\"). Under the TCPA, if creditors or debt collectors are calling your wife's cell phone using an automated system (robocalls), and the calls are made without consent, each call is worth $500. In addition, creditors and debt collectors are bound to comply with collection laws and they are prohibited from harassing your wife with excessive calls. If the creditors are violating your wife's rights, she could be entitled to up to $1,000. I recommend you contact an experienced consumer protection attorney for advice.",
        "From the information you have provided, without assets for the creditor to recover from belonging to your father-in-law, and without your names on the accounts, you would have no liability to the debt. These creditors, however, will often be relentless in their effort to collect. Do not allow them to pressure you into offering some type of settlement - as it is not your obligation.",
        "Typically estate debts are only payable out of estate assets. If your wife did not co-sign on this account she has no responsibility to pay the debt out of her personal assets. Obviously she is being contacted since she is the trustee of your FIL's estate. I would suggest writing a letter to the creditor informing it that the estate is insolvent and there are no assets to satisfy their debt.",
        "No. Unless, you make some promise to the creditor, if some asset is held partially in your name or if you received assets from the deceased. A trustee is not personally liable unless he/she misappropriates trust assets. If there are no assets, the creditor cannot collect.\n\nIf the collectors continue to bother you, you should consult an attorney who files and litigates Fair Debt Collection lawsuits against debt collectors. The availability of such a lawsuit will depend upon specific facts, but if the collector makes any false or misleading statements that are not true, you might have a good lawsuit, even if you do not pay the bill. Also, check your credit report to see whether the collector is trying to report the debt as your personal debt.",
        "Not out of your own pockets unless you or your wife cosigned on the account. If your fil left an estate subject to probate, his debts would be paid in the probate process. If your wife is trustee of an iv trust, the trust assets aren't subject to creditor claims. Hope this perspective helps!"

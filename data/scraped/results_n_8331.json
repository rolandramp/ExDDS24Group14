        "Both of the above answers are correct, and you may need to work quickly to file an amendment to your bankruptcy petition before the case closes. However, any and all executory contracts (that is, contracts in which the parties have not fully performed as required) must also be listed on schedule G, as instructed on that form. The contract itself can be accepted or rejected. While you are amending the contract you should also amend schedule G.\n\nBankruptcy requires review of your entire financial situation including all debts, income and assets. I highly recommend that you retain an experienced bankruptcy attorney in your jurisdiction to guide you through the complexities of bankruptcy law and procedure.\n\nIf you find my answer helpful, please click the ‘thumbs-up’ tab below.

        "If your case was a \"no asset\" chapter 7 case (i.e. no assets were liquidated and/or distributed to creditors) then the debt to the unlisted creditor was discharged along with the other debts.\n\nThe case that provides this is In re Beezley, 994 F.2d 1433 (9th Cir. 1993).\n\nIf that creditor has a basis to challenge the discharge of their debt (e.g. because it was incurred through fraud), then they do have the ability to seek permission from the court to late-file a complaint objecting to discharge.

    "title": "What are my options when a civil suit is filed against me and a judgement has been issued?",
    "question": "A civics suit was filed against me from a creditor and I was not aware because I was never served properly. The proof of service shows it was delivered to someone at a previous job I had years after I left so I never received it. The first knowledge of the suit is when a wage garnishment filed in 2013 was served once again to another former employer Who I’m not sure how long he had it until he personally gave it to me.",

    "title": "Will filing for bankruptcy protect backpay from SSDI?",
    "question": "I have been on state disability for almost a year, with tens of thousands in medical debt and other consumer debt but not credit cards from 11 year old debt to recent. I also have about 80K in student loan debt. I have mental health issues that have prevented me from maintaining a job or address for more than 6 months and a history of non payment.",
    "answers": [
        "It seems that you most definitely need some assistance in getting your concerns addressed. if your only source is SSDI, then there should not be a problem with a chapter 7. More facts would be needed to ascertain the student loan discharge avenue. You do have other options as well. As indicated, you should contact a San Diego Student Loan Lawyer who also practices bankruptcy.",
        "Most of your debt will go away, possible even the student loan debt given that you are unable to work. See DJ Rausa who is a San Diego bankruptcy lawyer who specializes in the discharge of student loan debt.. good luck to you. You can find Rausa on the Find a lawyer tab on AVVO.",
        "You sound like a good prospect for BK 7. Student loans generally not discharged in BK but you may be able to apply under their hardship programs."

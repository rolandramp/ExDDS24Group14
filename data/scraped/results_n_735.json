        "They should not be able to come after you personally because once a discharge order is entered, it usually means your responsibility to pay that back goes away. However, if there is a lien on your house then that typically survives the discharge order. Meaning it attaches to your house and may get paid off during the sale of your house. You need to have a bankruptcy attorney look over the lease paperwork to see if they could attach your house and record a lien. I suggest you consult with a bankruptcy attorney.",
        "Yes, but the lien on the house may be a stickier issue. Consult with a bankruptcy attorney",
        "Your personal liability on this debt would be discharged in your chapter 7. You should also state your intentions to surrender the solar system back to the lender. You will need to review the lease contract, or have an attorney do it, to ensure that there is no security granted. Typically on a lease, the security is the items.",
        "If you did not permit a lien to be recorded, yes, your obligation on the lease will be discharged along with the rest of the unsecured dischargeable debt.",
        "Have a look at your paperwork. You probably allowed a lien to be filed against your residence, in which case your personal liability would go away, but the lien would survive the Chapter 7."

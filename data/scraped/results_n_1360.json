        "If your husband was not listed as a defendant on the Judgment, then the creditor cannot garnish your husband's wages. The judgment creditor can however levy your joint bank account if you do not file for bankruptcy or make payment arrangements with the judgment creditor. I recommend consulting with an experienced bankruptcy attorney in your local area to discuss your bankruptcy options.",
        "You need to talk to a Bankruptcy Attorney right away and talk about your specific situation. There is a lot more to it then can be easily answered here.",
        "If you file for bankruptcy and the debt is discharged, (generally) a creditor cannot collect that debt from the debtor's spouse. That is known as the \"phantom discharge.\" You will benefit from a consultation with a reputable bankruptcy attorney. Most bankruptcy attorneys offer free consultations.\n\nIf you were never served with a summons and complaint for the lawsuit, you might also consider discussing the situation with a debt-collection defense attorney. It might be possible to \"set aside\" the default judgment, litigate that case against you, and defeat it. If that's the only debt that is problematic for you, that is also worth exploring.",
        "This is why you need to meet with an attorney. BK in your case is not a do-it-yourself project. The prior BK discharge should be reviewed. The judgment needs to be reviewed. Was your husband named as a defendant in the lawsuit? There are ways that a creditor can go after your husband's interest in your community earnings and community property, but it is somewhat cumbersome. You should see an attorney how, rather than later.",

    "question": "I need to pay my traffic fines through my bankruptcy plan, but I do not know how to get them paid if there are listed on sch \"F\" as an unsecured debt.",
    "answers": [
        "If no claim has been filed for this debt, you may file a claim on behalf of the creditor. File as a priority debt and the claim will be paid before your unsecured creditors.",
        "You are correct, they do belong on schedule F, however -- as noted above-- it may be possible to treat them as \"special\" creditors if there is grounds to do so such as retaining your drivers license. You should discuss with competent legal counsel from what the traffic fines arose, to determine if they are dischargable and how they should be dealt with in the chapter 13 plan.",
        "You may file a proof of claim on behalf of the creditor/collection agency in your own case. That way the trustee will send out notice of intent to pay claims and if not objected to, the creditor will begin to get paid.",
        "The first question is why do the tickets need to be paid? Bankruptcy forgives many governmental debts. If the ticket(s) resulted in the loss of your driver's license then you may need to pay them. If you need to pay them, you need a special classification in your chapter 13 plan. The special classification is to provide for payment in full even though other debts are not being paid in full. The court has discretion to allow a special classification. One doctrine to support your classification is the \"critical vender\" doctrine.",
        "They should be listed on Schedule E as \"priority debts owed to the government\". That should do the trick. Remember, BK is not a DIY project. Hire/consult with a BK atty by clicking the AVVO tab \"Find a Lawyer\". Many of us offer free consultations."

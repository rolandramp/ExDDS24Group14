    "title": "Single mom $21,000. in debt on disability...should I file B.K.?",
    "question": "I am a single mom who has not rec'd child support in 9 mos. and may not in the future. I already started paperwork for a BK with a Paralegal with $21,000.00 credit card debt and I am disabled. I recently was approved for permanent disability and rec'd 1/2 of that debt in back pay. I am really confused now as to whether I should continue with the BK or try to negotiate with my creditors. I am not sure how negotiating a final payment, if even possible, will affect my credit vs/the B.K. I am 30-60 days behind in payments.",

        "You should contact an attorney to discuss your situation. Someone experienced can discuss your options with you and help resolve any confusion about whether to declare bankruptcy or whether to negotiate with your creditors.\n\nYou should be aware that a paralegal cannot give you legal advice (although they can and often do), and cannot appear with you at any required hearing(s). In my experience, many \"pro se\" debtors (people who do not have an attorney) end up being questioned much more or even harassed at their hearing than people who have attorneys. Inevitably, people who use paralegal services have significant errors and omissions on their schedules. Even a very experienced paralegal may not practice law, and although completing bankruptcy schedules might seem easy, it requires a knowledge of the law in order to complete them accurately.\n\nMany of my clients want to try to negotiate with their creditors, and for most of my clients it is not a good option given their situation. Again, I hope you will take the time to contact an experienced and knowledgeable attorney in your area who can discuss your situation with you and help answer your questions.\n\nDainen N.

    "title": "Does the automatic stay toll the SOL on a judgment lien-credit card debt? Do you have to consider the years that you were in",
    "question": "bankruptcy in order to get the real expiration date of the judgment/judgment lien? So, if I was in bankruptcy for three years, the expiration date would be extended for 3 more years, at least, giving them 13 years after the entry of final judgment before the judgement expires, and they can still renew the lien, if they want? Does anything change that rule if the debt was discharged?",

        "The first question is, was the debt discharged in a bankruptcy. Once a lien is in place, the debt becomes secured. Most, if not all secured judgment lien can be avoided, which means removed, with a motion, in an open bankruptcy. This is not something that you should try to do by yourself. If you had a bankruptcy attorney, go back to that attorney, or hire a new attorney. But, not something that most people can do without some help.",
        "Typically, if the debt is discharged the judgment lienholder will pull the lien if you ask them nicely. You may need your attorney to ask for you.",
        "It seems like you have a couple of different questions here, and a very precise answer is going to require talking to a lawyer who can analyze all of the facts in your specific situation. That being said, let me see if I can give you a couple of general legal ideas that might point you in the right direction:\n\n1. In California, statutes of limitations are \"tolled\" for the time that you are in bankruptcy. That means that the time you were protected by the automatic stay in bankruptcy does not count for the purpose of calculating time under a statute of limitations.\n\n2. If you were discharged, you have no remaining personal liability on the underlying debt. The statute of limitations has no more bearing; the creditor cannot collect against you. However, without taking some action in your bankruptcy to remove the lien (if your circumstances allow), your bankruptcy does not remove their lien.\n\nI hope that helps.",
        "It sounds like you filed a bankruptcy and received a discharge. The bankruptcy alone will not remove a judgment lien from your assets; however, in most cases you can file a motion to remove the lien as part of the bankruptcy process. These motions can be filed after the bankruptcy is finished and are routinely granted by the courts so I suggest you try that. If the lien is removed by the bankruptcy court then you do not need to worry about the expiration date.",
        "The discharge of your personal liability for that debt has no effect on the lien."

    "question": "Hi, wife and I are in the middle of a divorce. There is an ATRO (Automatic Temporary Restraining Order) in effect. We have three joint checking accounts. During the marriage we also share our credit cards by adding each other as authorized users to each other's cards.",

        "The Cliche is that \"the devil is in the details.\" I think that you must look very closely at the details to divide your question up. Did she violate the ATROS when she closed the joint checking accounts -- probably YES, as that was a transfer of property. Did she violate the ATROS when she took your name off of credit cards -- that is actually unclear, since your ability to plunge deeply into debt may not, in fact, be \"property.\" Did she violate the ATROS when she changed passwords -- possibly, but it is NOT clear that your \"right\" to incur debts with these companies really is \"property.\"\n\nAs attorney Peters pointed out, you need to read the back of the Summons. Most of what she did is not really a clear violation. The only one that looks clear to me is when she took the joint account money. How hard do you want to fight in Court over half of a couple hundred dollars?",
        "She can remove you from credit cards, and close accounts and change passwords. She can't transfer property or borrow against property that would create debt on your behalf. As long as she can produce any share you have in the joint account she has not violated the ATROs. Read them more carefully. Your wife is not required to leave these things so that you can violate the ATRO by creating more debt with the credit cards. She cannot dispose of persona or real property. Or cancel insurance policies.\n\nhttp://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/fl110.pdf",
        "If she did these things after having either filed the Petition (if she's the Petitioner) or been served with the Summons and Petition, then yes, she violated the ATROs.\n\nBefore you make an issue of it, however, consider a) what your damages were, and b) how much trouble you're willing to undergo to address it.\n\nIf she changed the name of utilities that YOU use, then this is a problem, but the easier answer might be to contact the service providers and open your own accounts.\n\nYou still have the right to request reimbursement or property division, etc., even if you never \"nail\" her on violating the ATROs.",
        "Yes, she did, but there may be little you can do about it. If you ho to court, it's going to be ugly, and costly."

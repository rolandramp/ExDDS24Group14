        "Judgment vacated merely means there is no judgment, i.e., the judgment has been cancelled. Unless the case was dismissed, the plaintiff can still conduct discovery and bring the case to trial. In most cases, it would not be necessary for the lawsuit to be refiled. The most usual circumstance when a judgment is vacated is when the defendant prevails on a motion to set aside a default and default judgment.",
        "If the judgment was vacated, it means that it will be scheduled for trial. They do not need to refile the case. It is not clear what type of interrogatories were served. If the interrogatories were the type that are used to obtain information from a judgment debtor, you should probably serve objections in the form specified in the Code of Civil Procedure. If the interrogatories are the type appropriate during litigation, you must respond. If you ignore the case, you will lose.",
        "It is unclear what the status of the case is. Judgment vacated then was the defendant required to file a response in court? Was the complaint dismissed? If the defendant filed a response in court after judgment was vacated, then discovery may proceed and interrogatories are included. Check online, if possible, to see what the online court records show for this case, perhaps the status of the case is not as you had imagined. I sometimes get calls from prospective clients who paid a settlement after being sued and the complaint served, but they did not have the papers done correctly and mistakenly assumed the case would be dismissed, but it was not.\n\nThis is a debt collection case. LRLO can be very efficient at intimidating unrepresented consumers, who are trying to be their own attorney. I recommend consulting and possibly retaining an experienced debt collection DEFENSE attorney to represent you in this case.\n\nRobert Stempler (please see DISCLAIMER below)\nwww.StopCollectionLawsuits.com\nwww.facebook.com/SoCalConsumerLawyer\nTwitter: @RStempler"

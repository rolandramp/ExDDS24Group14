    "question": "My wife and I agreed that the home will be mine. She is coming to California and wants to transfer the home to me via \"Interspousal Transfer Deed.\" After it's been recorded, we plan to file dissolution documents in the court pursuant to Marital Settlement Agreement. Can we proceed this way, or are we putting the cart before the horse with the transfer of the house? This is her preference as she does not plan on staying in California for more than a few weeks.",

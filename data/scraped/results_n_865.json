You may exempt any property that falls into one of the exemptions categories available in CA, up to the dollar amount listed. You will be able to kept this exempted property after you file bankruptcy. An exemption limit applies to any equity you have in the property. If the property is secured by a loan, such as a car or home, and you are current on the payments and the equity is covered by your exemptions, you may elect to keep making payments on the loan and keep this property through the bankruptcy.

    "title": "What should I do about my attorney who has already taken between $22,600 and $25,000 and refuses to answer my questions?",
    "question": "I've had 3 failed Chapter 13 BKs since 2009. I had 2 lawyers - the 2nd one has charged me between $22,600 and $25,000. He refuses to give me a full accounting of all I've given him, I can't tell the exact amount because he calls at the last minute and demands more in cash. Prior to my last hearing in April, he called me hours before we were to be in court & demanded that I bring $3,200 CASH with the implication that if I didn't he wouldn't represent me. That case was dismissed & the trustee sent my previous plan payments to my lawyer who not only refused to tell me he had the money, but also refuses to tell me why he won't give it to me. I have a letter from him that states that the money is mine. There is much more but I'm out of space. He refuses to answer my e-mails. I have receipts.",

        "I would check your court's website for Guidelines re Attorney's compensation in Ch 13s. There are very clear limits on how much the attorney can charge without filing a motion to approve additional compensation. Charging over $47,000 for a Chapter 13 is something I cannot see as ever be approved by the court. That would be appropriate for some, but not all, Chapter 11 proceedings, but for Chapter 13 pretty unheard of. Chapter 13 trustee can launch investigation into this issue and it is likley to be more effective then State Bar complaint."

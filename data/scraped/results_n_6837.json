    "title": "Statute of limitations in California on an unsecured debt",
    "question": "I checked my credit report and saw that there were two collections from Midland Credit Management from which were the result of two seperate Verizon Wireless accounts. I sent them a letter to verify the debt and all they sent me was the last billing statement on both accounts from April 13, 2005. I have requested all three main credit reporting bureaus to investigate the validity of the information and have not received a response yet. Is there something else I should be doing? The statute of limitations is 4 years in California and these accounts are past that. Any advise will be appreciated.",

        "This one can be tricky.\n\nYou are correct that in most instances, the statute of limitations on a written contract is four years in California. However, the four year period can be \"tolled\" (put on hold) under certain circumstances, such as when a debtor is out of the jurisdiction. Also, the four year clock can be re-started if the debtor acknowledges the debt, either by making a payment or simply by saying something like \"I know I owe the money.\"\n\nIf you haven't made a payment or acknowledged the debt in over four years, then be sure to let the debt collector know, and demand that they stop reporting the time-barred debt as a current obligation.",
        "You don't need to worry about the statute of limitations on the original debt if it dates back to April 2005. If you want the two accounts removed from your credit report, the best way to do it is by suing under California not federal law. That is what my office does. I suggest you contact me for additional details. Because these accounts are in collections (and no longer with Verizon) there is a very high probability of success.",
        "It is generally 4 years from the date of the last actual payment or charge on the account.",
        "Federal law explicitly sets a two-year limitations period for lawsuits aimed at collecting cellular telephone service debts. See 47 United States Code Section 415(a) (\"All actions at law by carriers for recovery of their lawful charges, or any part thereof, shall be begun within two years from the time the cause of action accrues, and not after.\") Thus, I believe that any dispute letters that you send incorporate this reference.\n\nHowever, for purposes of credit reporting, the period of time that an unpaid debt in collection may be reported is 7.5 years from date of default. Credit reporting is uniform for all debts and all states per the Fair Credit Reporting Act, it does not relate to the statute of limitations.

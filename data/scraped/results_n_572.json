        "Bankruptcy is probably going to be your quickest option to rebuilding your credit. Definitely call around to a couple experienced and reputable bankruptcy attorneys and discuss your financial situation with them. They will be able to recommend what is best for you. $30k is a medium amount of debt and bankruptcy may benefit you by allowing you to just eliminate it all at once instead of hashing away at it over time. A chapter 7 (assuming you qualify) is only about 90 days from when you file to when you receive your discharge. Additionally, if you are already late on your debt or have collection accounts then bankruptcy can benefit you even more by just wiping that bad debt out.",
        "If your concern is your credit score and your credit is already bad due to lates, collections etc. then bankruptcy is the best option. Payment plans on collection accounts won’t help until the balance is paid. Bankruptcy will help balance your debt to income ratio and give you a fresh start which is what you need. You will be able to recover from a bankruptcy much quicker than paying off $30k. Contact a knowledgeable bankruptcy attorney for a free consultation.",
        "Go see a few BK lawyers immediately before you do anything else. You should have no difficulty finding lawyers who will give you a completely free consultation. Why would you even think about paying the collection agencies when you already failed to pay the original creditors. You are going about this all wrong and desperately need professional advice."

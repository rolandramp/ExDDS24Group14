        "I cannot comment on the bankruptcy issue but you may be able to do something about the EDD overpayment. If you received the letter recently, you should file an appeal.\n\nThe Notice of Determination telling you about the overpayment contains information about the appeal. You MUST file your appeal within the time limits stated on the letter, or have a very good reason for any delay. In the appeal, make a brief statement saying why you believe the denial was incorrect. Save your detailed argument and evidence for the hearing. For example: the decision that I owe money to EDD is incorrect.\n\nIn a few weeks, you will receive notice of an appeals hearing with the date, time and location. At the hearing, be prepared with as much evidence as possible. You should also know the law the administrative law judge will consider. You can get a lot of helpful information on the EDD website.\n\nHome page\nhttp://www.edd.ca.gov/Unemployment/\nEligibility requirements\nhttp://www.edd.ca.gov/unemployment/Eligibility.htm\nSummaries of the law (Benefit Determination Guide)\nhttp://www.edd.ca.gov/UIBDG/\nAppeals\nhttp://www.edd.ca.gov/Unemployment/FAQ_-_Appeals.htm\nPrecedent Decisions (law the administrative law judges rely on)\nhttp://www.cuiab.ca.gov/precedent_decisions.shtm\nFrequently asked questions\nhttp://www.edd.ca.gov/unemployment/FAQs.htm\nFiling a claim for unemployment benefits\nhttp://www.edd.ca.gov/unemployment/Filing_a_Claim.htm\n\nYou can be represented by anyone at the hearing. If your appeal will be difficult or you are uncomfortable speaking, you may wish to retain an attorney to help you prepare or to represent you. For training, expect the attorney to need approximately three hours. For hearing representation, expect the attorney to need three to seven hours to prepare, depending on the complexity of the case, witnesses, documents and other evidence, and allow two hours for the hearing itself. Unemployment hearings usually last one hour or less, but you must arrive early to look at the file and there is a possibility you will have to wait for the previous case to finish.\n\nGenerally, as of 2015, plaintiffs employment attorneys in California charge between $250 and $700 per hour for legal services.

        "Filing for bankruptcy would discharge the amount you owe on benefit overpayments. It could be difficult to get the tax refund back, however. You may have a chance if you file very soon. That being said, there are many issues that go into filing for bankruptcy. You need to sit down with one ore more bankruptcy attorneys as soon as possible to discuss all of your options. Most bankruptcy attorneys offer free consultations. Best of luck to you."

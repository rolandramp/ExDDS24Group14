        "It is likely that you are not being sued by the original credit card company but rather a junk debt buyer who bought your debt for pennies on the dollar and is now attempting to collect the entire debt from you. I mean pennies: for example, say they claim you owe $6k. It is likely they bought the debt for under $100. You may not need bankruptcy--certainly if this debt is your biggest concern.\nThe problem with these junk debt buyers is that they do not typically have any of the documentation necessary to support the lawsuit. They hope you will either call and make arrangements to pay or do nothing and have a judgment entered against you by default which they will then attempt to execute on either by seizing your bank accounts or if your state permits it garnishing your wages. I believe child support is exempt.\nYou need to challenge this lawsuit and you need help--not from a bankruptcy lawyer but from an attorney experienced in handling these types of cases. If you got letters in the mail from attorneys you tell you then can represent you and have the case dismissed or at least withdrawn, call them. Another option is to go to the website for the National Association for consumer lawyers and search for an attorney near you. Do not wait for a judgment to be entered against you--then it may be too late. Call someone now.\nIf it is a junk debt buyer who sued you they will need to produce documentation that they now own this debt. This can be done by producing the bill of sale. THey don't have it. They may produce a bill of sale that says they bought debt listed on an exhibit or schedule but this documentation is never attached. They may be able to show they bought debt but not your debt. They may add an affidavit or statement from the company that says they bought your debt. This take my word for it document is not a business record and does not support the claim.\nThis is a breach of contract case. Have they produced the contract or agreement you signed or just an exemplar of an agreement.\nThey say you owe a certain amount of money. Did they produce all the statements so you can add it up--all the purchases, interest, penalties, late fees, etc. Without the statements, the amount they claim is not a provable sum. That affidavit that says they checked and you owe it is simply not enough. Typically they attach the last statement or a few statements. They may attempt to get around this using an \"account stated\" theory. Many states do not permit it and do not know if your state recognizes such a claim for a credit card case.\nYou may have other defenses including the statute of limitations.\nAgain, it is in your best interest to challenge this lawsuit. Secure representation today. It should not be very expensive. You owe it to yourself and your children to fight this lawsuit.",
        "It sounsd like you agree that you owe the credit card so there is no need to be present or defend yourself. Once they obtain a judgment, they can levy your bank account It sounds like you need to meet with an experienced bankruptcy attorney right away. Also, some bankruptcy courts offer clinics to help very low income debtors. Check with the bankrutpcy court in your area to see if this help is available. Many bankruptcy attorney offer low fees and take payments on them over time, although your case won't be filed until the fees are paid. In the meantime, keep your money out of the bank.",
        "If your child support is deposited in your bank account, your bank account balance can be levied by a judgment creditor. You may be able to fight the bank account levy, but its easier to avoid the issue altogether by changing banks. Unless you have a \"defense\" to the CC claim of non-payment, you're going to incur a filing fee of several hundred dollars or file for a fee waiver, but to what end? You appear to be \"judgment proof\". If you get a job, buy a house or win the lottery you will have assets to be levied, otherwise, you don't have the financial horsepower at this stage of the process. Good luck and God bless.",
        "No - they cannot garnish your child support.\nWhat are you planning on doing to \"defend yourself\"?"

    "title": "Can I keep my car in California, if I don't reaffirm the debt.",
    "question": "Filed a chapter 7, ( Pro Per) majority of my debt was medical bills with the exception of my car. I continued to pay my car payment on time. Credit union says if I don't sign the reaffirmation agreement they will pick up my car. The last payment I made was returned, although they had accepted the others. I did not get the reaffirmation agreement from them before the meeting of the creditors, just received it a few days ago. Now they are calling me saying I must sign or else they will pick up car.",

        "You are in between a rock & a hard place. Although some vehicle lenders won't repo a vehicle after a bankruptcy as long as payments are current, several will unless you have signed a reaffirmation. Depending on whether the vehicle has equity or not, you may want to look into purchasing a replacement vehicle and tell the credit union to \"eat metal!\" Hope this perspective helps!",
        "You must reaffirm or redeem the vehicle or the credit union can repossess your car once the automatic stay terminates.",
        "While I agree with the other responses, in some jurisdictions if the judge does not believe that it is in your best interest to reaffirm the auto the judge may allow you to keep it so long as your remain current on the vehicle. The judges here in the Southern District of California often will not approve the reaffirmation agreement if it is not in your financial interest but will issue a \"ride-through\" order that allows you to keep the vehicle so long as you remain current. You may want to check the feasibility of such an order in your jurisdiction.",
        "California law allows the lender to repossess the vehicle even when payments are made if you do not reaffirm. Not all lenders will repossess if you are current with your payments. It appears that the credit union is taking a hard line and have put you on notice. If keeping the car is important to you then you have to sign the reaffirmation document. You must understand that having filed the bankruptcy you can walk away from the car with no liability. If however, you reaffirm the debt and anything should go wrong later you will be personally for the outstanding balance."

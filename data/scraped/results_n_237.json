    "title": "Can I file bankruptcy and keep some credit cards?",
    "question": "I have close to 100K in debt in revolving accounts, credit cards and personal loans. I don't own anything and my income has been drastically reduced due to COVID-19. Some creditors have worked with me but others have not, resulting in a larger debt due to late fees and APR increases. I would like to keep a credit card with a low limit for emergencies and to begin to build my credit again.",
    "answers": [
        "The short answer is 'no' - you do not get to keep credit cards in a BK. Any credit accounts with balances will be immediately closed. There's a slim chance that a card with a zero balance will not be closed; but it doesn't really matter because once you receive your discharge of all your dischargeable debts, you will be offered a number of new credit cards.",
        "In my experience, once you file bankruptcy, all your cards are cancelled, even the ones you want to keep. You do get to keep your debit card of course. Having said that, you will get new credit card offers before you even receive a discharge in bankruptcy because the credit card companies know you can only file a chapter 7 once every eight years. You can also get a prepaid card as well.",
        "If you file a Chapter 7 bankruptcy, you are required to list all creditors that are owed money. If there is a balance, it gets listed in the bankruptcy petition. However, if you have a credit card with a zero balance, you are not required to list it in your bankruptcy petition. While you may think that this zero-balance card could be used to help rebuild credit post-bankruptcy, more likely than not, the issuing bank will likely shut the card off when they learn of your bankruptcy filing. Good news: many debtors have little difficulty getting new credit cards post-bankruptcy if they are smart about rebuilding credit.",
        "Generally, when one files bankruptcy their credit card accounts are closed even those that have zero dollar balances. The bankruptcy code requires the debtor to list all their creditors on their paperwork. One of the purposes of bankruptcy is to provide immediate relief to the debtor and treat creditors fairly by eliminating the debt owed to them.\n\nMany debtors are able to take out a new credit card after their bankruptcy closes. If used appropriately, this is one way a debtor can rebuild credit post-bankruptcy.\n\nI hope this was helpful.",
        "The responses already provided cover great information that you should seriously consider. Particularly, I urge consulting directly with an experience bankruptcy attorney to analyze your bankruptcy options from all relevant information about your income and assets. Additionally, a budget of your monthly living expenses compared with your income is important for you to consider - you really should focus on this information to figure out how to live without depending upon credit cards. It is good to have a credit card for an emergency but relying on them to make ends meet is not a solution. This site is a great resource to locate an attorney to guide you. Good luck.",
        "No is the answer as stated by the attorneys above. You will get a mailbox full of offers once your case is discharged. My advice is to begin building an emergency fund of 6 months living expenses after your are discharged. Set aside money each month until you reach that goal.\nUsing credit cards for emergencies is a huge financial mistake that leads to trouble. If you get a card down the road, pay the balance if full every month without exception.\nImagine how your life would be now if you did not have the debt (and you had 6 months of expenses in the bank). You would not looking at bankruptcy. Learn form this and you will bounce back quickly.",
        "My colleagues are right. You'll be surprised by manyk new credit card offers. They will have low limits and high interest. You can pick a couple to get your credit rebuilt. Don't pay minimum payments. Pay off in full. Avoid those with annual fees.",
        "As the other attorneys indicated, you cannot pick and choose. Quite frankly with $100k in credit card debt, you should consider not using credit in the future.",
        "You have to disclose everyone to whom you owe money. So, if you have a balance on this card at the time you file your bankruptcy, you are obligated by law to list it and you sign the documents under penalty of perjury that you have listed all debts.

        "I agree with Mr. Woolley, it really depends on the dentist. If you had no intent to pay back the debt when you incurred it, the debt is non-dischargeable and you may be facing an adversary proceeding for a determination of non-dischargeability. However, as adversary proceedings generally are very expensive and time consuming, the dentist will probably do the same thing that the rest of your creditors will do once they receive notice of your BK: Nothing.",
        "Almost NO creditors ever show up at the meeting which means by asking such you probably have NOT discussed with an attorney. Filing bankruptcy involves MANY other issues which as a result I strongly encourage you to employ one. Other issues I set forth below.\n\nYou need and want to enjoy your fresh start also. But the most important thing is to meet with an attorney as you asking this question means you have not. You care about 2 goals: keeping everything you have equity in and discharging all your debts. If you don't have any of the exceptions to discharge you will obtain that goal; most exceptions are set forth in 11 USC. 523 (Google it) like child support, some income taxes, traffic (in a ch 7) and criminal fines , and presumption of student loans. But some debts are dischargeable in a ch 13 but NOT in a ch 7 so you want to make sure and your attorney will discuss any such types with you also!\n\nYour exemptions depend on what state you have lived in in the last 2 years and thus if in your state, then your states exemptions will apply. Most persons filing keep everything they own but your attorney will confirm that with you when they learn everything you own and the equity thereof!\n\nSome secured debts like homes, vehicles, other secured debts an attorney will discuss your options on also as you must list any debts; but that does not mean you will lose them unless you have too much equity or are in default on paying for them! Discuss those options if they apply with your attorney too.\n\nBut other issues can arise that can greatly harm your case. Just one example: If you paid back a relative $3,000 11 months ago and now file bankruptcy next week, the trustee can SUE that relative to retrieve that $3,000 (under what is called a preference) for the benefit of the bankruptcy estate. As a result, most attorneys don't charge to meet with them the first meeting so meet with one no matter what.\n\nMany great attorneys can be found right here on AVVO in your state so look, call, and meet one as soon as you can.\n\nYou should also want to know when to file: is there an advantage of waiting versus filing now and who should you pay between now and then! Good luck and enjoy your later fresh start.",
        "Attorney Elie and Woollie are spot on. If the dentist does not object, you're in the clear. If the dentist objects you will have to fight the adversary (which will be expensive and you'll lose). I would advise you to stipulate to an agreed upon settlement and payment plan IF the dentist objects and seeks payment. Big IF. Best of luck.",
        "It really will depend upon the dentist and how aggressive they want to be. Most dentists have no clue about bankruptcy and how to object to your bankruptcy filing. If you did that at my wife's dental office, I would object to your bankruptcy discharge as to the debt. I would allege that your conduct was fraudulent because you represented that you were going to pay the bill when the dentist performed the procedure but you knew you were going to file bankruptcy. If this was an emergency procedure, it would be different. Fortunately for you, the dentist will probably get your bankruptcy notice and do nothing.",

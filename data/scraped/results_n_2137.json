    "title": "My wife is driving a car that is registered under my name what can I legally do to remove my name from the registration?",
    "question": "I have a restraining order on my wife. She is currently in possession of a Jeep Patriot that is registered to me at the DMV. I am financing the car through NAVY Federal and still owe $10K on it. My wife does not want to give me the car back. I plan on continuing to make the payments to Navy Federal but I do not want to continue paying insurance on a car I am not driving. What is my best option? She has a suspended license as well. If I remove the car from my insurance what am I responsible for if she gets into a car accident or the car gets impounded? She doesn't not work as well. Can I go ahead and report the car stolen or will the car fall under community property and I cannot report it stolen? Should I go to the DMV and remove myself from the registration?",

        "Is there a divorce case that has been filed and pending? If not, then there is nothing you can do as the car is probably community property. Once you file a divorce matter then you will be required to maintain the status quo on such things as auto insurance until a judgment is entered and all the assets and debts are divided.",
        "The prior answers have covered your question. I would just make sure the car is insured. Fully insured it's better to be safe than sorry. Best of luck.",
        "The car is not stolen; file the appropriate Request for Order with the order for the sole and exclusive use of the car.",
        "If you did not request the car back in the restraining order, you must do so through a divorce case. Be aware that once you file a divorce action, you are prevented from cancelling or changing the insurance.\n\nIf the car is financed in your name, you have few options to properly remove your name from the car outside of a divorce action if she won't cooperate with you. You also do not want to resort to self-help because that will get you in hot water, especially if you are still active duty. and your efforts could backfire and cause you credit and other troubles.\n\nConsult an attorney and begin or continue the process of divorce.",
        "You are right to be concerned about insurance coverage. The car is not stolen. It is HIGHLY unlinkely you are the first person this has ever happened to. Talk to the lawyer handling your family matter and s/he will know what to do about this. Do NOT make a false police report."

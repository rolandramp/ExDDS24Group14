    "title": "Does Postponing/Rescheduling a Trustee's Sale Violate Automatic Stay Under Chapter 13 BK Filing?",
    "question": "We filed a California Chapter 13 BK electronically a day before the scheduled Trustee's sale on our property; however, the debt collector simply postponed it to 30 days from this last scheduled date, instead of cancelling it. Is this allowed in the state of California, or must they immediate cancel the sale while the stay is in place, particularly after they get \"Hard Copy\" notice of the BK filing, or face a lawsuit? Wouldn't it be more feasible for them to just cancel it, and wait things out?",
    "answers": [
        "I agree with my fellow lawyers: postponing a trustee's sale in CA does not violate the automatic stay. The practice of virtually \"unlimited\" postponements as a result of a BK filing is permitted. The mortgage trustee never knows when or if your case might be dismissed or otherwise impaired due to multiple reasons, and will usually go for a series of 30 day postponements. I take it that you are in pro se?",
        "Yes ... it's allowed. No ... it does not violate the automatic stay. They will continue to postpone it for approximately 30 days each time until you have a confirmed Ch13 Plan.",
        "Delaying the sale while they monitor the bankruptcy is specifically allowed under case in the 9th Circuit, which includes California. it is pretty common for people filing a \"barebones\" bankruptcy to stop a foreclosure only to see it dismissed later.\n\nYou are wise to monitor the foreclosure date. Make sure you keep current on your payments and provides all documents needed by the trustee to avoid dismissal."

        "Although I never practiced in California, my former partner who is a chapter 13 trustee, did practice in San Diego for over 10 years. As I understand, there are two exemption schemes in California and you can choose the scheme that best fits your needs. If you do not own a home, you can chose the scheme that tracts federal exemptions and has a wild card exemption of $13,100.00 in anything including equity in a rental unit. Thus, you should be able to use the rental unit.\n\nYou need to understand that most debtors that file for relief under chapter 7 that later realize they made a mistake when they filed did not understand what questions to ask and issues to consider. If you are considering filing pro se, you nee to know that a US Courts survey in 2012 a pro se chapter 7 is 8 times more likely to be dismissed than a chapter 7 filed with attorney representation. That survey does not consider the other problems I mentioned above. That study does not consider the number of cases in which the Debtor lost assets or filed under the wrong chapter considering their particular situation.\n\nYou really need to take the time to meet with an experienced bankruptcy attorney that handles chapter 7 and chapter 13 cases. Most bankruptcy attorneys will meet with you at no charge for the initial appointment. You can use the Avvo \"Find a Lawyer\" link at the top of this page to search for an attorney.",
        "Be VERY CAREFUL. Get an experienced bankruptcy attorney who is VERY familiar with your housing laws. There is a very bad case that's been on appeal in New York on this very issue. Although what happens in NY is not binding here in CA, the case may be considered. Most Chapter 7 Trustees are members of NABT where they attend conferences, participate in listservs and share ideas on how to liquidate assets.\n\nI'm not familiar with the SF housing laws, but I know I'd be a fool to file a case without researching the issue for my client.

        "The \"equity\" in your apartment, if any , is most likely exemptable anyway but never seen any trustee go after such a rental in my 30 years and 8,400 cases I have filed! Now I assume if you rent $100 a month and it is worth $5000 a month and you have 4 yr lease that is different. In Washington you could probably exempt up to $125,000 equity in such value of the rental. California has other exemptions and all depends on all facts and other assets you own.\n\nYou need and want to enjoy your fresh start also. But the most important thing is to meet with an\nattorney as you asking this question means you have not. You care about 2 goals: keeping\neverything you have equity in and discharging all your debts. If you don't have any of the\nexceptions to discharge you will obtain that goal; most exceptions are set forth in 11 USC. 523\n(Google it) like child support, some income taxes, traffic (in a ch 7) and criminal fines , and\npresumption of student loans. But some debts are dischargeable in a ch 13 but NOT in a ch 7 so\nyou want to make sure and your attorney will discuss any such types with you also!\nYour exemptions depend on what state you have lived in in the last 2 years and thus if in your\nstate, then your states exemptions will apply. Most persons filing keep everything they own but\nyour attorney will confirm that with you when they learn everything you own and the equity\nthereof!\nSome secured debts like homes, vehicles, other secured debts an attorney will discuss your\noptions on also as you must list any debts; but that does not mean you will lose them unless you\nhave too much equity or are in default on paying for them! Discuss those options if they apply\nwith your attorney too.\nBut other issues can arise that can greatly harm your case. Just one example: If you paid back a\nrelative $3,000 11 months ago and now file bankruptcy next week, the trustee can SUE that\nrelative to retrieve that $3,000 (under what is called a preference) for the benefit of the\nbankruptcy estate. As a result, most attorneys don't charge to meet with them the first meeting so\nmeet with one no matter what.\nMany great attorneys can be found right here on AVVO in your state so look, call, and meet one\nas soon as you can.\nYou should also want to know when to file: is there an advantage of waiting versus filing now\nand who should you pay between now and then! Good luck and enjoy your later fresh start.",
        "You should not. Although it may be an asset, the trustees in Northern California generally do not look at a rent controlled apartment as a recoverable asset."

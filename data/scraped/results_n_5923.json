    "title": "Can the executor of an estate keep assets that aren't allocated in the will?",
    "question": "I'm the executor of my boss's estate. Most of his property is allocated in a will, but he has a few hundred thousand dollars in bank accounts that aren't designated to anyone. If he dies, and there is money left after settling all debts and payments, do I get to keep the reast?",
    "answers": [
        "Doubtful, unless the will says otherwise. If there's no residuals clause in the will, the remaining assets likely go to his intestate heirs. You are entitled to fees as the executor, though, under Probate code sections 10800-10805.",
        "Mr. Daymude is correct. Even if there is no residuary clause, your boss would die intestate as to those assets and they would pass to his heirs at law. Since you describe him as your boss, I assume you are not related in any way, so you are not an heir at law. See an attorney to assist you with this probate so that you make sure you do everything correctly.",
        "Nice try. No. I am fairly certain the Will contains a residuary clause which states who gets what is left over. Unless you are named a beneficiary, that would not be you."

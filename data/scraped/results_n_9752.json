    "question": "My father passed away last month (40+days ago). I am the named Executor in the will and sole heir. I am also a joint tenant on his bank acct. His estate is small (under 100K), with no real property. I understand that his mobile home, which is paid for, doesn't count as real property under CA probate code. He has about 10K in credit card debt and a nursing home bill of apprx. 2K. I want to sell his mobile home in order to pay off his debts. I'd like to act quickly, due to a monthly rental charge of about $600 a month at the mobile home park. What is the best way to proceed? Can I use the small estate affidavit to collect his personal property, and to whom would I present it since all of his property is paid for? Since I won't be appointed Executor, what is my \"title\" and what authority do I have to act on his behalf",

        "Mr. Hoffman's answer was generally correct.\n\nBut for the mobile home, you will also need to fill out the DMV form for small estates. I've included a link to their website below.\n\nEven though the mobile home isn't real property, sales are usually handled through a title company. Most title companies will want you to give them a Small Estates Affidavit when they transfer the title (unless you've transferred title at the DMV beforehand & have a pink slip showing you are the sole owner of the property).\n\nYou don't say what other \"personal property\" your father had. If it was just \"stuff\" (like clothing, sofas, bedroom furniture, etc.), then you don't need to present the affidavit to anyone. If he had things that had a title (like a car or a boat), then you need to give a Small Estates Affidavit to the DMV or whatever agency regulates that particular asset.\n\nAs you probably know, if you collect assets using a small estates affidavit, you are also responsible for the debts up to the value of the assets you collect. The bank account wouldn't count (since you were a joint owner, you will not be using a small estates affidavit to collect it). But you'd need to look at the value of the trailer, his car, his boat (if any), etc. Add up the values. If the debts are less than the values of the assets, you're responsible for paying all of the debts.\n\nThis information is not intended to substitute for professional legal advice and does not create an attorney-client relationship.

        "Since you are on the bank account, all you should need to do is go to the bank with a certified copy of the death certificate and have the bank account changed to your name.\n\nAs for the mobile home -- the Cal. Dept. of Health and Safety generally regulates the sales of mobile homes. Check the website, there is probably a downloadable form that you can fill out. Most likely, it will require you to provide at the very least, a certified copy of the death certificate. The DHS may also want to have an affidavit to collect personal property -- this is found is Probate code sec. 13100-13101. But check the DHS forms first. The idea would be to transfer the mobile home to your name as the sole heir, and then you can sell it directly.\n\nYou should also contact the credit card company to let it know of your father's death -- the company will freeze the card and delete interest from acruing from the date of death.\n\nFinally, if your father was on Medi-Cal, you need to inform the State of his death."

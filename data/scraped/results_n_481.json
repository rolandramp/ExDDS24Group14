    "question": "Few yrs ago I had a title loan and I stopped giving payments and they took possession of my car. Now, they sued me and I have to answer back. The court gave me some papers to fill out and I have to send a copy the company that sued me and another copy for my self. I am willing to pay the debt. I don’t understand the part of the answer form that says “To complaint of and To-cross complaint” what option I have to check? Thanks.",

        "The purpose of an Answer is to admit or deny the allegations made in the Complaint. The allegations usually claim that you borrowed money and you didn't pay it back. Can you deny that you borrowed the money? Can you prove that you paid it back? Do you have any defenses, such as that the contract violated consumer protection laws or that the lawsuit was filed beyond the statute of limitations?\n\nWhat I have found in these normal loan situations is that there really is no defense to the lawsuit except perhaps as to the amount. Is that worth your time and effort? You may want to consider settlement of the amount you owe, or if you can't and you have other debt issues, consider filing bankruptcy.",
        "I agree with Mr. Boyer, you may want to consider bankruptcy if you have other debts. If you want to pay this debt I would recommend contacting the attorney that filed the lawsuit and working out a payment with them, this could resolve the lawsuit. If you file the answer you are answering to the complaint, not a cross-complaint.",
        "You clearly have significant financial problems, if you had to resort to a title loan. Depending on your overall financial situation, Bankruptcy may be right for you. An experienced CA Bankruptcy attorney will be able to determine which type of Bankruptcy, if any is the correct one for you. Use AVVO's Find a Lawyer tool to select a qualified attorney. Good luck. THIS IS NOT LEGAL ADVICE! YOU NEED TO SPEAK TO AN ATTORNEY WHO IS LICENSED IN YOUR STATE FOR LEGAL ADVICE. This is merely suggestions for you to think about in discussing your situation with the local attorney."

    "title": "Can creditor access judgment proof debtor's checking/savings account after court rules on creditor's request?",
    "question": "After losing job, 68-year-old debtor's only income is social security retirement and unemployment--also receiving gov't housing and medical assistance. Now unable to pay credit card debts. The minimum payments equal entire social security check. Is it true that even though debtor is judgment proof, creditor may still access or attach debtor's checking/savings accounts, especially if the government deposits are made electronically? Should debtor withdraw all funds from checking/savings accounts if not filing for bankruptcy protection? Thank you!",

        "If the collection agency is actually aware that your client's only income is Social Security and that the account holds only funds from this source, it may be an illegal and abusive act to attempt to freeze the account with a levy. The attorney and collection agency can be held liable for damages etc. under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. A creditor may be held liable under the California Rosenthal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act.\n\nAgain, you should put the attorney on actual notice that this account contains only these exempt funds. Also, contact the bank and ask them how they may handle it if they receive the notice, since they should know all funds are exempt, and reject the levy.\n\nThe alternative is to take the money the day it appears in the account and only use money orders and cash to pay for things, but money orders get costly to use in place of regular checks.\n\nMy web site has much useful information to stop a debt collection lawsuit, which I have in the link below.",
        "Creditor can levy on those accounts even though they contain exempt funds. Your remedy is to file a claim of exemption within the 10 days allowed. If you do sheriff will hold funds until motion is decided. If you cannot live without those funds until the hearing on your claim, take them out of the bank.\n\n\nThe response given is not intended to create, nor does it create an ongoing duty to respond to questions.

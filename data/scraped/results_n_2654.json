    "question": "My dad lives in CA. He owns rental property in Alaska which produces monthly income. He has designated me in his will to receive this property when he passes away.

        "No. Rental income from property of estate will be retained by personal administrator during probate process. Income will be used to pay costs of administration, estate liabilities, on-going expenses. If you have an immediate need for income from estate, you may petition for preliminary distribution.",
        "It is not possible to know what your rights will be in your father's estate. Too many factors that will affect the nature and extent of your inheritance will have to be taken into account when the time comes. For instance, before any property is distributed to beneficiaries, the debts of the decedent and expenses of the estate must be paid. Until income-producing properties are distributed and transferred to the new rightful owner, the income is property of the estate, and may well be needed to pay debts and expenses. When the time comes, the information needed to know more precisely what to expect will be available from the estate's executor and/or attorney.\n\nBest wishes for an outcome you can accept, and please remember to designate a best answer.",
        "No as the estate must finish probate and there must be an order for distribution before anyone receives from the Will as an heir."

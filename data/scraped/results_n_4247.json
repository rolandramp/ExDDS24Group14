    "title": "Can Caregivers be classified as 1099 independent contractor in California if they are working for an home care agency?",
    "question": "My parents own a home care agency, that provide companionship services to the elderly. They are being fined by the EDD for $170,000 for misclassifying the Caregivers they send out as Independent contractors instead of W-2 employees. Is the EDD Correct? If the EDD is correct how do they protect themselves (their company in an s-corp). If they file bankruptcy will they still have to pay the EDD?",
    "answers": [
        "Whether a worker is an employee or indep. contractor depends entirely on the duties of the worker and the amount of control, if any by the employer/principal. The State of CA began cracking down on employers who misclassify workers and not only can the EDD audit and fine, the IRS can too as well as other agencies. Your parents need to pay a reasonable amount to consult with an employment law attorney and should have done so BEFORE the EDD audit. To continue to go forward without legal counsel is probably foolish and may end up costing them more money. For example, if the workers were misclassified, the workers can sue for any labor law violations which may have occurred going back up to 4 years, including, but not limited to, meal/break violations, overtime, etc., etc. Those lawsuits can be VERY costly. Filing bankruptcy may allow your parents to discharge some of the claims. Any debts owing to the government, however, may not be discharged if they are new charges. If your parents are considering filing BK, they will need to seek the advise of BK counsel as to whether and how much of any government debts they can discharge.",

Most EDD auditors are not lawyers and use very basic outlines when auditing to determine whether they consider individuals to be employees or independent contractors.

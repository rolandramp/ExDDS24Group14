    "title": "How does Ch. 7 Bankruptcy affect a pending lawsuit filed by collection company on medical bills I am attempting to discharge?",
    "question": "I just received a summons in superior court for a medical bill debt that I owe for surgery a few years ago. The collection company is trying to seek a judgement against me for this debt. I am thinking about filing for Chapter 7 Bankruptcy because of these medical bills and so I am wondering what will happen with the pending lawsuit? And will the bankruptcy discharge trump the pending lawsuit, meaning if I file for bankruptcy before or after the superior court makes its ruling on the collection company's lawsuit, does that debt still get discharged since it is an unsecured debt?",

        "The lawsuit will be stayed if you file Chapter 7 Bankruptcy pending the judgment. Most lawsuits will go to default judgment when the debtor does not file an answer within the time indicated on the summons, or they file bankruptcy. The Judgment, should it come to pass, is a debt that can be included in Chapter 7 bankruptcy.\n\nThe judgment would be a general unsecured debt, and you will be able to include any medical debts incurred through the date of filing, including judgment debts.\n\nOnce the creditor gets a judgment, they do have the right to enforce the judgment against the debtor, unless and until there is a bankruptcy filing.",
        "Chapter 7 will stop this lawsuit collection of this debt.\n\nYou will be fine.\n\nAs a side note, if you are still in the middle of medical treatment, you should hold off on the bankruptcy. Wait until you are reasonably through your medical issues.\n\nGood luck and hope you are getting better.",
        "I basically agree with my colleagues but have one caveat. In most jurisdictions a judgment acts as a lien against real property that is owned in the county/jurisdiction where the judgment is entered. If you own real property when the judgment is entered against you, it automatically creates the judgment lien and the judgment lien would survive a subsequent bankruptcy unless you file a Motion to Avoid the Judicial Lien in the bankruptcy. If you file before judgment is entered or if you do not own real property, then the bankruptcy will halt the lawsuit in its tracks and assuming you get your discharge, your obligation to your creditor will be discharged.",
        "A judgment is no more able to withstand a bankruptcy than was the original debt.\n\nIf you have ongoing medical issues, you probably want to wait to file until you've accumulated all the debt you're going to accumulate. If you foresee that you'll have new debts in the near future, it is better to wait and discharge as much debt as possible.\n\nFor issues of timing the bankruptcy, there is no substitute for hiring an experienced debt relief attorney.",
        "The Chapter 7, or the filing of any bankruptcy, will stop the lawsuit you are talking about. Pursuant to 11 USC 362, the automatic stay would be effect on the day you file your petition, and you provide that proof to the Court, and your case should cease in that court."

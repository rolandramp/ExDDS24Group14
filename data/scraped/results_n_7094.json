    "title": "How do you turn a remainder of a arbitration award into a judgment or how can I collect the remainder owed.",
    "question": "Can you please tell me what I need to do to turn my arbitration award into a judgment. I live in Riverside County California, I filed a claim with the CSLB against a contractor and through the arbitration process I was awarded over $17,000. Through his bond I received $12,500 but a remaining balance of $4800 is due and he refuses to pay. I read that I can turn a award into a judgment but can not seem to find the steps or process needed. If this process does not relate to my situation do you know what can be done to collect the funds owed? Thank you so much for your time.",

        "In California, a petition to confirm a contractual arbitration award is brought pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure section 1285, et seq.\n\nThe petition must comply with the requirements of California Code of Civil Procedure section 1285.4, providing a copy of the arbitration agreement, the name of the arbitrator, and a copy of the award. Pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure section 1286, the court must confirm the award unless it determines that there are grounds to correct or vacate the award or to dismiss the proceedings.\n\nYou can use this form:\n\nhttp://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/adr106.pdf\n\nFor other forms, go to the group of forms for \"Alternative Dispute Resolution\" at\n\nhttp://www.courts.ca.gov/forms.htm?filter=ADR",
        "Generally, what you need to do is to file a petition to confirm the arbitration award with the court in the county where the arbitration took place. The court will then ultimately convert it to a judgment.",
        "A lawsuit must be filed to convert the arbitration award into a court judgment. There are virutally no defenses so it is a relatively quick procedure compared to normal litigation which goes to trial. It is fairly simple for an attorney, and not too expensive, but a pro per may have some difficulty. The court judgment, however, is not the same as collecting on the judgment which still may remain a problem."

    "title": "I filed Chapter 7 in 2011, agreement with Toyota Finance to keep car and make payments in California, but they took car anyway.",
    "question": "After filing chapter 7, I made arrangements with Toyota to continue payments on my vehicle. In 2013 ,I had surgery and missed 1 payment, but did not realize it. The following payment caught up the missed payment for every month to the current date today. Toyota sent a company out yesterday, they drug car out of my driveway by hooking the rear bumper, would not show me paperwork. Now Toyota wants payment in full plus repossess fees. I asked for notice of intent, they said it takes 7 days, asked if I could reinstate the loan, they said no. When asked why not, they said because of the bankruptcy? Payment due in full only and said I am 51 days late. Am I being discriminated against for bankruptcy? I made May 2014 payment and all payments but one, for almost 5 years.",

        "They can repossess your car when you miss one payment, bankruptcy or no bankruptcy. hese entities are typically very unforgiving. If you caught back up on the payment before they repossessed (which is unclear from your statements) then the repossession was improper and not done in good faith. As these other attorneys have stated, you need to figure out whether a reaffirmation agreement was formally entered into and approved by the court. If you did not enter into a reaffirmation agreement, then your personal obligation to pay was discharged, but they still had right to repossess based on their lien. If there was some sort of other written agreement that they made you sign that was not a formal reaffirmation agreement, then this may be an unlawful violation of the court's order of discharge. If they are sending collection letters or threaten suit then this may also be a violation of the discharge. If you want to keep the car, then a Chapter 13 may work, but the costs associated with it probably won't make economic sense. You should consult with your former bankruptcy attorney, if you had one, or contact a bankruptcy/consumer protection attorney in your area",
        "If you did not sign a reaffirmation agreement, then you likely have no ability to re-instate the loan. You should contact your bankruptcy attorney to discuss and see if you can do an immediate 13 to get the car back if it is worth it for you to do so.",
        "When you said you missed a payment but did not realize it, apparently Toyota did realize it and took the car for that reason. The repo company does not have to show you anything. They work for Toyota. You do not have a \"right\" to reinstate your loan under the circumstances. Did you sign a reaffirmation agreement? Did you have a lawyer?",
        "When you say that you \"made arrangements\" with Toyota, do you mean that you signed a reaffirmation agreement that was approved by the bankruptcy court? If you did, Toyota can only legally repossess the vehicle if you were behind on the payments required by the reaffirmation.\n\nIf you did not obtain a valid and approved reaffirmation agreement, though, the analysis is quite different. Without a reaffirmation, vehicle creditors can repossess vehicles even if you are current on the payments that were required under the original note. That's the general rule, at any rate, though there are many potential exceptions that you could argue depending on factual details.\n\nIf Toyota legally repossessed the vehicle, they are not obligated to allow you to reinstate the loan by becoming current on the required payments. You could have some options, such as using a Chapter 13 bankruptcy to pay the full balance over time, but you need to consult with an attorney to see if that is a good idea in light of all of your other financial circumstances.",
        "First, if the value of the car is LESS than the amount owed including repossession costs, be done with it. You can go buy another car NOW just like it in better condition and if you did what you should have since 2011 with your credit your score should be good for a decent interest rate!\n\nSecond, assuming no reaffirmation, it is simple . Your debt is GONE. You cannot be one day late which you failed to do. So, they could only exercise their rights as legally they cant ask you to pay the missing debt as that would be a violation of the discharge and THEY could be sued! They are entitled to their fees because you actually caused it by paying late! So sit back and see..what do you really want? Want to go \"car shopping \" today on Saturday? Check out on Internet the sales of similar vehicles and see what you want. If not paid back in full, then you may NOT possibly want to be in a ch 13 to pay off as you would NOT obtain a discharge unless you filed MORE than 4 years after your ch 7 was filed but that was in 2011!\n\nFinally, if your vehicle is worth more than ALL debts owed on it, go to your bank and see if they will give you a loan to payoff in full so you can pay your bank back..but act quickly"

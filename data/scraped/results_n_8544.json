    "question": "The value of my home is more than what I owe on the property, but combining the 1st + the second they are more than the value. If I file ch. 13 providing I have employment, can it still effect the second loan. I am not being foreclosed on but am being threatened by the bank on my line of credit. I owe less than $500.00 on the second, but 3 months behind on the first, and still making monthly payments on the first. I want to know if ch. 13 can help my situation, thanks.",

        "I have successfully filed many lien strips on real estate. If it is your primary residence and the liens only cover the real estate, then the only question is whether the house is worth more than the first. If so, then the second is secured and cannot be removed. If the house is worth even one dollar over the payoff on the first, the second is secured and cannot be changed.\n\n[This communication is intended as general information and not specific legal advice, and this communication does not create an attorney-client relationship.]",
        "There seems to be a contradiction in the first sentence of your question.

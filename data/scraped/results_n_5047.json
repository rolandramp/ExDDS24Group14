    "title": "Retired defaulted on credit cards, never received a 1099-c and haven't filed for income taxes in 15 years.",
    "question": "My mother is now 88. I am her son/ caregiver. Years ago she defaulted on her credit cards. She has not filed any income tax forms for over 15 years. Her Social Security and pension are not taxable. If she defaulted in 2007, now past the SOL, and she hasn't filed any income tax forms since around 2000, how can you do a wage and income transcript search with the IRS, concerning if any 1099-c was filed? Would the IRS still have some kind of transcript, even if she hasn't filed? or should I just forget about it.",
    "answers": [
        "I agree with the other attorneys. You may not have a filing requirement here. It depends on what the amount of cancelled debt is in this case Even if it is a large amount it may not be taxable if she is insolvent at the time of the debt cancellation. These are questions that cannot be answered without additional facts. I give a Free Initial Consultation. If you are interested give me a call.",
        "I agree with my fellow lawyers. If you don't have sufficient income, no tax returns need be filed. This might be a question better answered by a tax specialist.",
        "The IRS would still have transcripts going back that far, based on SSN. If they received any 1099s, they would show in the transcript for the year. They would also send her a request for tax return or other response, if she received 1099s without filing a tax return for that year.\n\nIs it possible that she has not filed in so many years that they no longer have her address? Also, if the 1099 has a wrong address on it, then the IRS might not have her current address and she would not know if a request for tax return had been sent to her. How long has she lived at this address?\n\nIf you want to order tax transcripts from the IRS, the link is below. Not all financial institutions issue a 1099-C, though it is become more frequent in the past couple of years. If you are referring to a 1099-C several years ago, there's a good chance it was not sent.\n\nRobert Stempler (please see DISCLAIMER below)\nwww.StopCollectionLawsuits.com\nwww.facebook.com/SoCalConsumerLawyer\nTwitter: @RStempler"

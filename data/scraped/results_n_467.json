        "Your attorney should know based on your particular situation.",
        "I agree with both prior answers here. Your current attorney is the right person to be asking. If you are not getting the answers you want from your current attorney then I suggest considering your options to hire another bankruptcy attorney. Many great bankruptcy attorneys are right here on AVVO.",
        "You should direct that question to the attorney you just hired. Several factors exist that are not identified in your question",
        "I think it would be prudent to file the bankruptcy soon. Big banks and credit unions have cross collateralization provisions in in their agreements which could make your car collateral for the credit card. They may not actually try to repossess the car because that is an extreme remedy, but it would be a big project to get the car back. Just file your bk case now."

    "question": "IF the judge in a UD ction decides for the landlord and possession only, and the tenant files BK, does this prevent the eviction? How does this work? What is the point of the eviction if it is not going to happen even after you win the case?",

        "If the landlord sued the tenant for eviction and won a judgment for possession BEFORE the tenant filed for bankruptcy, the landlord CAN proceed to evict the tenant, even if the tenant then files for bankruptcy in an attempt to stop the eviction. Otherwise, the tenant is shielded by the \"automatic stay.\" The landlord can still file a \"lift stay\" motion seeking permission to pursue the eviction, but this requires notice and would stall the process by roughly 30 days or more depending on if the landlord acts quickly if at all. After the automatic stay, the landlord can resume the eviction.",
        "The tenant cannot stop an eviction for possession after judgment by filing for bankruptcy. The eviction can proceed, however, any money judgment or subsequent civil action for money owed will be stayed during the bankruptcy proceeding unless there is a motion to lift the bankruptcy stay and proceed with the civil suit for money damages.",
        "I disagree with Mr. Cook, who is not licensed in California. The automatic stay does not apply to stay an eviction in California once a judgment of possession is entered. If a judgment of possession has been given to the landlord, a sheriff must serve a writ of possession notwithstanding a tenant's filing of bankruptcy after the judgment of possession. The stay would apply to any collection on a money judgment for rent and costs, but it would not operate to stop the eviction itself."

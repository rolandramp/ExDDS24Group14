        "While I am unsure of your explanation of the facts, it sounds like the credit card company may have obtained a judgment against you and recorded it with the county recorder. If this is true, the judgment will become a lien against any now owned or after acquired real estate in that county. In certain circumstances, you can avoid judicial liens against real estate. You should speak with a qualified bankruptcy attorney to discuss the facts of your particular case.\n\nDisclaimer: The materials provided herein are for informational purposes and neither constitute legal advice nor should they be relied upon as legal advice. Every situation is fact sensitive, and it is impossible to evaluate a legal problem without a comprehensive consultation and a review of all facts and documents at issue. This answer does not create an attorney-client relationship. I am a California Bankruptcy lawyer. You should consult with a bankruptcy attorney to obtain advice specific to the particular facts of your case.",
        "Perhaps you mean an abstract of judgment, which records a lien on any real property that you have in the particular county in which it is filed. It is one of the ways to enforce a judgment, but is fairly meaningless unless you plan to buy any real estate in the particular county or currently own real estate in such county. The judgment itself has more meaning to you, because until you have the judgment either set aside (see my web site below about that), fully satisfied, or discharged in bankruptcy, you will find it impossible to obtain financing for property you wish to buy.\n\nIf you have no real property, I'd be more concerned with a possible wage garnishment, bank levy, or order to appear in court to discuss your finances, assets, and income (known as a judgment debtor's exam). Please consider my web site and if you were not properly served with the summons and complaint, your best option is probably to have an experienced debt collection defense lawyer set aside the default judgment."

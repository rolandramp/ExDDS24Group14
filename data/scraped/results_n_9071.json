        "I practice bankruptcy law in the Central District and I have had the U.S. Trustees office specifically look at whether the dependents were on the tax return. The safest way to deal with this issue is to claim your dependents on your tax return. However, there is no need to despair as there are many ways to pass the means test. You just need to find an attorney who has the experience and the patience to go through the means test. There is usually a way to pass the means test if you work with your attorney. And I agree with another answer that you absolutely cannot trust the online calculators. It is a bit more complicated than that. Good luck!\n\nPlease note that although this answer may provide information concerning potential legal issues, it is not a substitute for legal advice from qualified counsel. You should consult an attorney for individual advice regarding your own situation.

        "In the Central District of California, the test is generally \"heads on beds\"--ie: how many people actually reside in the debtor's household on a full time basis. That said, there is considerable uncertainty in this area of the law and not much guidance yet from the courts.\n\nMoreover, just because you are \"above median\" for a household size of 1 does not mean that you are necessarily ineligible to file a Chapter 7 bankruptcy with no presumption of abuse--even, possibly, without counting your brothers. It is necessary to do a complete analysis of your situation. There are a variety of factors which can come into play to make above-median debtors eligible for Chapter 7. These include, but are not limited to, the following: allowable payments on secured debts, reasonable expenses for elderly or disabled family members (whether or not they reside with the debtor), expenses for dependents, unusual medical or household expenses, etc... Most bankruptcy attorneys (myself included) offer a free consultation. I do not recommend that anyone (especially \"above-median\" debtors) attempt their own means test calculations using free online calculators. Such calculators are generally not tailored to your individual filing district and may not include the latest inflation adjustments, etc. There are a variety of complex considerations which must be taken into account.\n\nMost attorneys (myself included) use specialized bankruptcy filing software which takes into account all of the most recent changes and adjustments to the means test. Please call my office if you would like to schedule a free consultation in order to conduct a tailored analysis of your situation.",
        "Each court can vary in what they use for the definition depending upon where you are filing. Many follow the US Census Bureau's definition that includes all people who occupy the housing unit, which would include your other family members. Some trustee's will ask if they are claimed as a dependent as well. The size of the household needs to be consistent through the case. It will raise a red flag if you list 3 family size for the means test and then only list 1 on any other schedules or filings."

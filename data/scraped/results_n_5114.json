    "title": "I received a letter from a random lawyer that I was being sued by a debt collection agency w/o being in debt. What do I do next?",
    "question": "I just got my credit report checked 2 weeks ago, and there are no debts on there aside from my car and college loans. I have excellent credit. N & Kennard are the attorneys in this case and I have seen that they usually go after people in these circumstance. I'm going to fight them to the ground. How should I approach this lawsuit? I was never officially served. I believe I perhaps had a CC stolen and someone may have racked up a lot of debt on it, but all my accounts are in good standing. I also have over a 780 credit score, so wouldn't this debt have appeared on my report? Any information would be helpful on how to take on these leeches. Thanks!",

        "It is not possible to tell you how to defend against this lawsuit, since you do not describe the lawsuit's status. Was the case just filed? Is there a default against you? A default judgment? When did the case begin? When you say \"never officially served,\" what does that mean? Were you \"unofficially served,\" or did you find out about this claim for the first time when you received this letter?\n\nOnce those questions are answered, a lawyer can begin to advise you as to how to proceed. I strongly suggest you contact a lawyer in person for this strategic advice, since those communications would be protected by the attorney-client privileged, and materials in a public forum like this are not. You may be able to have the claim dismissed by convincing the plaintiff in a strong letter that you have no liability, or you may have to defend against the lawsuit.\n\nThere are many fine lawsuit and litigation lawyers on AVVO, and many of us handle this type of claim. I suggest you start contacting lawyers on the \"Find a Lawyer\" service here to see if they can represent you.\n\nI also do not recommend that you try to handle this yourself. Litigating against someone represented by a lawyer is at best an uphill fight."

    "title": "Can I object to discharge of debt in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy case where the debtor is my former employer who failed to pay wages?",
    "question": "In 2012 I was employed by a California company which was recently acquired by a Florida company. I resigned from the merged company at the end of 2012. The company failed to pay all of my owed wages upon my termination. I filed a claim with the State of California Labor Board and was awarded a judgment (about $25K) in October 2013. The company never responded to the judgment. Shortly afterwards the company apparently went out of business, but I don't think they filed for formal corporate bankruptcy. Three years later, I've just received a Suggestion of Bankruptcy and a Form 309A for a Chapter 7 personal bankruptcy filing (in Florida) of the company's CEO and his spouse, including me as a creditor for the California judgment. Of course I want to object to any potential discharge of this debt, but I don't know on what basis I could make the most persuasive argument to the Florida bankruptcy court for such a motion. I would appreciate any suggestions.",

        "Yes. Wage earner may object to discharge of pre-petition wages earned and owed by debtor.\nWages are entitled to priority treatment.",
        "First, the corp. is a separate entity and even if dissolved, its assets are for the benefit of its creditors but there may be none left.\n\nSecond, if you did not sue the CEO individually, then you would have no claim against them ; however, it is possible if their estate possesses assets of the corp then you could have a claim against it so discuss that with your attorney.\n\nThird, the debt appears to be a dischargeable debt just like any other claim for wages. Exceptions to discharge are in 11 USC 523 ; take a look at you will see it appears none apply. Therefore the debt would be discharged.\n\nLastly, before you waste a lot of money chasing them think about the above, how much to try and chase, and the fact that it is probably dischargeable before you employ an attorney . It is up to you. This is not legal advice and you should rely on the advice of an employed attorney. But that is my take on the situation.",
        "It is does not sound as if you any specific facts to challenge the Chapter 7 filing, unless you know something about the CEO's financial status. If he, it listed you as a creditor may be a precautionary move, unless he is named in the judgment. If he is, then you should make a claim in his bankruptcy."

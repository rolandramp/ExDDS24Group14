    "title": "Who has the right to sell the house in a Divorce?",
    "question": "My wife and I got a divorce. As part of the divorce, I grant deeded the house to her. The loan is in my name ONLY. She now has defaulted on the house and she wants to short sale the house. She has a Real Estate Agent that she listed the house with, but I don't want to use that Agent. Since the loan is in my name, I have a buyer for the house, but my ex-wife won't sign with my Agent. Who has the right to sign the listing agreement with an Agent, me since I am the only one on the loan or my ex wife who received the house in the divorce settlement, but the loan is still in my name?",
    "answers": [
        "The divorce decree would dictate the distribution of assets and liabilities. Based upon the facts presented in your question, your ex-wife holds sole title to the property and she can convey that interest to anyone she chooses and list that interest with a real estate agent. However, since the mortgage (assuming it is a loan secured by this home) is solely in your name, she cannot short sale the property without your consent as well as the lender's agreement. Her default on your loan in your name could potentially be in contravention to the divorce agreement. The divorce decree appears to have created a troublesome situation.",
        "I would think that the owner of the house has the right to sign the listing agreement. If you deeded the house to her, you probably have no say in the matter.",
        "You problem is probably rooted in the actual agreement for the division of assets and debts. If you deeded the house to her as ordered in the agreement or judgment, wasn't she also required to take the debt on the house? How was the debt disposed of in the judgment or agreement? That is your key as to what needs to be done. You probably will have a difficult time getting the proper remedy without using an attorney to help you.",
        "\"I got a divorce\" doesn't tell me whether the Court retained jurisdiction to enter orders on the house. Usually they do. The title owner can list and sell the house, technically, unless you go to court to get an order to have the court stop the listing, and do something different. I won't tell you to \"get a lawyer\", but suggest that if you don't know what an RFO is, how to calendar a request, how to serve the other side, how to prepare a detailed declaration in support of your request, and how to present your position to the court by way of testimony, witnesses, exhibits and follow all necessary court procedures through a hearing and preparation of orders, you may need an attorney."

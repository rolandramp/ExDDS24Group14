    "title": "How do I stop a judgment against me.",
    "question": "I had a judgment against me back in 2011 and just yesterday 01/17/2017 the collection place called me and stated I still have to pay for that judgment against me. The thing is they are trying to bill me for medical bills going back as of 2000. It's that to far isn't there a statue of limitations for the state of California that is 5 years only that they can go back and bill me? Or am I wrong.",

        "I agree with Mr. Sinnett. Bankruptcy may be a good option to wipe away the judgment. It is a good idea to be pro active now and explore your options. I recommend you consult with a bankruptcy attorney.",
        "Once a creditor has a judgment against you, then the statute of limitations no longer applies. The statute of limitations only applies before a lawsuit is filed.",
        "The statute of limitations only applies to the deadline to file a lawsuit. Once they've filed and obtained a judgment the statute of limitations doesn't apply. If you have a judgment for medical debt you might was to consider simply eliminating with a bankruptcy. I would definitely talk to a bankruptcy attorney and see if thats an option.",
        "Judgments in California are valid for ten years and can be renewed.",
        "The important issues here are: 1) when was the last activity on the account; and 2) when was the lawsuit filed. If the dates that are the answers to those questions are within four years of each other then it's likely the judgment is valid.\n\nThe question of whether the debt is collectable is easily answered, and the answer is that it is collectable forever; it's just that it can be more difficult to collect a debt that hasn't been reduced to a judgment without the legal tools available to collect/enforce a judgment.",
        "The judgment is good for 10 years and can be renewed prior to the expiration of that 10 year period. The Statute of Limitations does not apply in this case. Consider elimination of debt through bankruptcy. Consult with a local bankruptcy attorney. Most offer a free consultation.",
        "At this point, your options are to: (1) set aside the default judgment for lack of service, (2) satisfy the judgment in full, (3) discharge the debt in bankruptcy, (4) allow it to grow and be enforced on your assets and income, or (5) settle and get the plaintiff's collection counsel to file a satisfaction of judgment in full. Consult a debt collection DEFENSE attorney to explore which of these options is a good fit for you and your finances.",
        "The Statute of Limitations relates to the period of time in which the creditor must file a lawsuit. If the lawsuit was filed within 4 years, the subsequent judgment is within the Statute of Limitations. After a judgment is entered, it is good for 10 years, and the creditor can renew it for another 10 years. Why did you allow a default judgment to be entered in this case after you were served with Summons and complaint?",
        "The time to \"stop a judgment\" is before it is entered. Court rules limit the ability to set aside a judgment once it is entered. Regarding the statute of limitations which might have been raised, calculating the statute is not as simple as you might imagining. Typically on an open account, such as medical bills, the statute commences upon the last activity, so every payment restarts the statute. For the specific advice needed in this situation, contact local experienced litigation or consumer rights counsel.\n\nBest wishes for an outcome you can accept, and please remember to designate a best answer."

    "title": "I rec'd a debt collection letter from a law firm in CA for an three year old credit card debt with US Bank.",
    "question": "The original debt is with US Bank for $12K and have been through 1 collection agency already. Apparently it was sold to a second collection agency and this law firm represent them. I sent a debt validation letter the same day but, out of curiosity, I called to try and make a settlement and they stated that I have to pay the full amount or else they will file a lawsuit. Why wouldn't they settle for less or is this just they strong arm tactic to start out with?",

        "There can be countless reasons for not settling, including because they don't want or have to.",
        "Assuming the debt is valid you could have an attorney try to settle the debt for you. If a bankruptcy attorney who represents you negotiates with the creditor then the creditor might realize that there is a chance that you could file a chapter 7 bankruptcy. If you did file and get a discharge then the creditor would probably receive nothing.\n\nThis sometimes helps to get creditors to agree to a settlement that would be more beneficial to you.",
        "it is always very bad practice for a lawyer to psychoanalyse another lawyer or an opposing client. Perhaps it is because you contacted them without a lawyer and they think you will be unable to effectively defend litigation. Perhaps they are not authorized by their client to accept less. It is conjecture."

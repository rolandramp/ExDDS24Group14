    "title": "Can I sell my car while in Bankruptcy?",
    "question": "I filed for Chapter 7 in California and had a hearing on July of this year. No creditors contested except for a civil lawsuit which I included in the Bankruptcy. I received a summons and they are claiming non-dischargeability of this suit. My Bankruptcy has not been discharged because of backlog and will probably be discharged late November.",

        "The car is not yours to sell until the trustee abandons it (which means he or she can't get anything from it because it is exempt or not worthwhile selling.). After the trustee abandons the estate which may have already happened, your car is yours again to do with it whatever you want.\n\nThe problem is that a creditor is saying that one of your debts is not dischargeable in bankruptcy. If you need to sell the car to be able to pay living expenses or an attorney to represent you against the creditor objecting to your discharge then I see nothing wrong with selling the car if the trustee gave up on it. Since you need to consult with a lawyer about the lawsuit in bankruptcy, why don't you ask him/her the question about selling the car? The proceeds from the sale of the car might not be enough and then you'll end up with no car and no lawyer.",
        "You need to check with the bankruptcy trustee. If you exempted the car and the bankruptcy trustee doesn't have a claim (or has abandoned its claim) than you may be able to sell it, otherwise you may need to file a motion with the court allowing you to sell the car (assuming you exempted it).\n\nUntil the trustee closes the case, all assets of the bankruptcy estate belong to the trustee (unless the trustee agrees to abandon the asset). Abandonment of the asset also requires a motion or notification to all creditors.",
        "You are right to be concerned about disposing of your car until your case has been closed. You can contact your Chapter 7 Trustee to see if he is willing to abandon the car and what steps you must follow. You may need to file a short motion requesting the Court to abandon the asset. You will probably not get a discharge until this non-dischargeability lawsuit is resolved (if I understand your question correctly).\n\nBest,\nLeonora Gorelik\n\nDisclosure: This response is for general information only.

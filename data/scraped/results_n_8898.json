    "title": "Is it really that bad of an idea to form a Single Member LLC?",
    "question": "I noticed a single member LLC can basically do nothing after forming the LLC and the IRS will classify it as a sole proprietor for tax purposes. If you have no employees, you will not need a EIN (correct me if I'm wrong on any of this) and can use your sole proprietorship EIN or SSN for tax reporting.",
    "answers": [
        "An LLC does provide even a single member with limited liability, if the owner takes care to treat the entity as a distinctly separate legal thing, both from an accounting and legal standpoint, capitalize it adequately, etc. The most important factor in allowing a claimant to \"pierce the corporate veil\" is when an owner tries to use a corporate entity to defraud someone and an inequity results.\n\nDisclaimer: Please note that this answer does not constitute legal advice, and should not be relied on, since each state has different laws, each situation is fact specific, and it is impossible to evaluate a legal problem without a comprehensive consultation and review of all the facts and documents at issue. This answer does not create an attorney-client relationship.",

No attorney-client relationship is created.\n\nGenerally (though not always) it is better to obtain a separate TIN.

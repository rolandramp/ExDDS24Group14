    "answers": [
        "If you live in California now you will file for divorce in California. As California is a community property state, assets and debts accumulated during marriage are presumed to be community property. That being said, you and your spouse can agree to whatever property division works for you which may include each of you retaining your own pension assets. However, you must BOTH agree.\nAs you have been married less than five years, you MAY qualify for a Summary Dissolution. There are specific criteria to qualify. If you do not meet those criteria, you will have to file for a regular divorce. You must have lived in the state for a minimum of six months before filing the Petition and a resident of your county for a minimum of three months immediately prior to filing the Petition.",
        "It really depends on the agreement but you would only be exposed for the two years you were married or whenever the separation date occurred."

    "title": "How can midland win a judgement without having to show proof of debt?",
    "question": "I just lost in court against Midland funding. I brought copies of the debt validation letter I sent them which they never answered and also told the judge but I never heard from Midland for almost four years after they filed a court date. The judge said it was my fault for not making Midland provide documentation. Judge also stated since I lived at the same address for the last 10 years that was enough to show that I knew about the debt and had plenty of time to contact Midland funding and work out an arrangement.basically I had to show all the proof that it was not my debt which does not make sense to me.I am wondering if I have grounds to file an appeal? Also one more thing Midland served me the trial brief as we sat down for trial.",

        "Midland's failure to respond to a letter requesting \"debt validation\" may give you the right to sue Midland in a separate lawsuit, under Title 15, section 1692g of the United States Code. However, it is not a defense in the lawsuit that Midland filed against you. What you should have done was to propound proper discovery requests under sections 2030 and 2031 of the California Code of Civil Procedure, and follow the related court rules. Actually, what you really should have done was to sit down with an attorney early on and get specific legal advise and an evaluation from an attorney who regularly practices in this area of law. At this pint, if you wish to file an appeal, you should know that an appeal is not a second chance to have a trial. The issues in an appeal are confined to the official court record of the trial court proceedings, which would include what is in the court's file. If there was oral testimony, you need to get a reporter's transcript of the oral proceedings. Did you arrange for a court reporter to report the trial proceedings?",
        "I have answered a lot of questions just like yours, and my answer is always the same. Yes, there is an example here and there of someone who, like you, decides to \"litigate\" every little thing in a debt collection case - they challenge the documentation, consumer laws, etc. - and they end up getting a debt case dismissed. But, that's a VERY small percentage of the cases - less than 1%, I'm guessing. For the other 99%, it is a total waste of time, and judges hate it since it appears like nothing more than playing games. I do not see in your post a denial of actually owing the money. Do you deny that you EVER borrowed money from whomever Midland represents (they aren't the original creditor, are they)? Unless that's your case, you're wasting your time, and the court knows it. Midland testified, basically, that you owed the money. Therefore, you have to then prove you DON'T owe it. A debt validation letter is meaningless - did you serve discovery upon them in the course of the litigation? If not, then it was your fault not getting the evidence YOU needed. The money and time an appeal would cost would (unless you owe Midland a fortune) outstrip what you owe to Midland, so an appeal would be a total waste of time as well.",
        "All over the internet there is misinformation being published and people making money selling books and other materials claiming that they can stop debt collection lawsuits without an attorney. Sure, a few cases get dismissed, if the key witness cannot show up for the trial, but California's Limited Civil Case procedures allow a simple declaration to be submitted in lieu of live testimony.\n\nIf the trial judge determines that the custodian's declaration complies with the statute and contains admissible evidence of the debt, then often a judgment is entered for the debt collection agency against the consumer debtor. Do you know how much additional costs you must pay to appeal? Do you know that the standard on appeal is to affirm the trial court's judgment, unless the appellant shows on the record what the judge did wrong (known as reversible error)? If you do not have a transcript of the actual trial by a court reporter, how will you present the record to show the judge was wrong?

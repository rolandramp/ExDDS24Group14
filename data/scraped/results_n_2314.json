    "title": "When my private student loan comes off of my credit report, will it no longer be an issue?",
    "question": "I took out a student loan for $8,000 in 2006, after an economical disaster it defaulted and now belongs to Navient. On my credit it states: Account charged off. $14,307.00 written off. $9,286 past due as of Jan 2015. Status details: This account is scheduled to continue on record until March of 2016. That is about a year away. What does this mean to me? I have other college loans that are being paid and in good standing. Will they no longer pursue retribution?",
    "answers": [
        "1. Its a private student loan, so it wouldn't show up on nslds, that website is only for federal student loans.\n2. Credit reporting and the collection of a debt are unrelated.\n3. They could still pursue you for payment even after the account drops off your credit report.\n4. What you probably have to watch out for is being sued by the private loan servicer. If the get a judgment, that judgment can be reported for the longer of 7 years (7 more years) or so long as the judgment is valid under state law.",
        "I don't disagree with any of the above, however, if the private student loan actually is private, and was taken out and used in California, and if you have not made payments in 4 years, and if you have not somehow reaffirmed the debt... the statute of limitations has run and the debt is not collectible. Only in BK is a private student loan not treated like any other debt. Outside of BK, the statute of limitations (Cal. Code of Civ Pro Section 312) will prevent collection on a written contract after four years. Private Student Loans come under this provision. Good luck.",
        "I concur with my colleagues and add this: A charge-off entry on your credit report does not mean you don't owe the money. Instead, it is basically a bookkeeping entry required by accounting practices that the debt has \"aged\" to a point where recovery is considered \"doubtful\". As such, it is removed as an \"asset\" by the lender which reduces the financial standing of the lender by a microscopic amount.",
        "Unless the loan is forgiven, you still owe the money. Creditors will typically \"charge off\" a debt so they can sell it to someone else to collect. I advise all of my bankruptcy clients to list ALL \"charged off\" debts. The only debts on the credit report you no longer owe are the debts listed as either forgiven or paid as agreed -0- balance. Whether a different creditor buys the written off student loan and attempts to collect it in the future is a question I can't answer."

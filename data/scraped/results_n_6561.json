    "title": "Wage garnishment ordered but they have the wrong guy.",
    "question": "I got an email from HR telling me that they are going to start garnishment of my wages. It is from a collection company for some money owed that I don't know anything about. After looking into it I found out the case was filed in San Diego. I've never even lived in San Diego. I am positive this is a case of mistaken identity and called the attorney trying to garnish my wages, but he refused to do anything about it. What can I do to stop the wage garnishment? I pulled my credit report and it shows up on there too. What can I do to get it off my report?",

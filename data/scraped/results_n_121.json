    "title": "Was in a chapter 7 & did NOT reaffirm/assume on my auto lease. When I turn it in, can they charge me for mileage/condition?",
    "question": "I was in a chapter 7 bankruptcy about 1 year ago and received a discharge. I've been paying all along on my leased car but didn't \"assume\" or reaffirm on it. From what I've read, that means I'm not liable. So my question is if I turn it in at the end of the lease, can the bank charge me mileage overage, \"excess\" wear and tear or condition, lease termination fee(s), etc?",

        "The contract of the lease was discharged by your bankruptcy. Thus, return it and indicate in letter that your bankruptcy discharged the debt . This is different that when a debtor assumes the lease where as then debtor is liable ( see https://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2020/08/03/18-55688.pdf ) for case on that issue. So glad you did not assume. That does NOT mean you can wilfully injure or damage the vehicle post petition though either. Thanks for asking here on AVVO."

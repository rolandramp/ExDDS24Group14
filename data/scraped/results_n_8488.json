    "title": "Changing my mind about surrendering my investment property",
    "question": "I have filed chapter 13 last year and included my investment condo.The attorney suggested I just surrender it. I agreed but now 1 year later with no actions from the bank, I would prefer to short sale it. I have realtors i know that will get the listing and I do not expect any profits from this since I am upside down by 80K. My attorney says he must petition the court to now let that property out of the bankruptcy and I need a reason for the courts to approve this action.Other than possibility looking better on my credit report as a short sale than a surrender, I dont have a reason. He said the court would not take that as a reason and will not suggest one that might be approved. Tenant is living rent free for the past year and she may want to buy it. What reason should be on the petition.",

        "With all due respect, the bankruptcy filing is the 800-lb elephant on your credit report; the difference between a voluntary surrender or a short-sale is going to be rather minimal in light of the big picture.\n\nHowever, there may be tax consequences to take into account. Canceled debts dis charged in bankruptcy are not subject to 1099c issues, but investment properties that are short-sold may create a taxable event that you would owe taxes on.\n\nPerhaps you should consider getting the tenant to pony up and pay rent,m and if she doesn't, then evict her! Do not let the tenant create financial instability that threatens your successful completion of the Plan.\n\nI hope this response was helpful.\n\nThis response is not intended to create an attorney client relationship, and if the issue does not involve the laws of the State of Florida, this response shall not be deemed to be legal advise but only a general response to a general question.

        "I disagree, the only good reason I could see is to get the property out of your name quicker. The title change ends the responsibility for taxes, maintenance and HOA dues. Whether you surrender or short sale makes no difference on your credit report, because the debt is discharged in bankruptcy either way.\n\n[This communication is intended as general information and not specific legal advice, and this communication does not create an attorney-client relationship.]"

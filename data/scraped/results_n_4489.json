        "In addition to the possibility offered by Ms. James, some courts want a good faith declaration regarding the debts and liabilities when an out of state representative is being appointed. This is because bond can be required, even if a will waives bond, when the personal representative does not reside in California. In that situation, the bond is for the protection of the creditors.",

        "You cannot waive an inventory & appraisal, but you can sell the property before you get one. You need to send the beneficiaries a \"Notice of Proposed Action\" informing them of what you intend to sell the property for (price) & other pertinent details (such as how much you intend to pay the real estate broker).\n\nYou can sell the property before changing ownership to the beneficiaries as long as the will does not specify that the property is supposed to be distributed to one of the heirs (a \"specific bequest\").

It can sometimes take 6 to 12 months after the sale of the property before you get the escape assessment notice.

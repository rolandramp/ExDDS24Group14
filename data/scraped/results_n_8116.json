    "title": "Will my son (TIC co-owner) be responsible for paying the full mortgage, after I file for Chapter 13?",
    "question": "I am faced with a judicial foreclosure from a property lien (old creditcard debts) and behind on my mortgage for 2 mos. My (TIC) son has not contributed to the house for the 15+ years since I have lived here. Since I plan to file for Chapter 13 protection, will the lender hold my son legally responsible for paying the mortgage in FULL or in PART? If he refuses and the lender forecloses on his share, will I have an opportunity to deal with the lender directly and pay off his interest through a reverse mortgage? I have tried to refinance and my son simply refuses to sign anything relating to the property. I highly doubt that he will commit to a payment plan since he has his own mortgage to deal with. Thank you in advance for your contribution in helping me make a well informed decision",

        "IF your plan is to save the property in your Ch 13, your plan will require that you make ongoing mortgage payments and restructure your arrearage over the lenght of your plan. Thus, your son should not be contacted for payment.\n\nIf you plan to surrender the property then, YES, it will be your son who is contacted for the deficiency after the foreclosure. Secondly, the mortgage company does not foreclose on a \"share\". The property as a WHOLE is foreclosed. You are both jointly and severally liable for the ENTIRE MORTGAGE. That is why both of you are on the mortgage.\n\nSo that dovetails into the WHY would you take out a reverse mortgage to pay off his share? Secondly, I highly doubt you would qualify for a reverse mortgage anyway if you have that much debt. HOWEVER, if you are truly in a 13 plan, your attorney would likely file a motion to avoid the non mortgage lien, if there is no equity in the property and then once your plan is confirmed, work to help you find a lender to refinance in your chapter 13. In healthier times, many mortgage brokers were helpful to refinance debtors in Ch 13 plans.",
        "Are you going into Chapter 13 to try to save your home from foreclosure? If so, you will be paying the mortgage in full, so don't look to the bankruptcy court to require your son to contribute to paying the mortgage.\n\nIf you are going to let the house go and are concerned that the mortgage company might come after your son for a deficiency, that is a possibility. However, in today's economy, it is not likely.\n\nSince strategy is so important in forming a Chapter 13 Plan, I urge you to give up on this notion of filing Chapter 13 without an experienced attorney to represent you. Most of the money your attorney is paid will come out of the money that would otherwise go to paying your unsecured debts, such as credit cards.\n\nHope this perspective helps!",
        "If your son is obligated on the mortgage, the lender will likely try to hold him responsible for the debt. The mortgage holder will also likely try to foreclose on your interest in the property as well, so you should contact a bankruptcy attorney before proceeding to ensure that filing bankruptcy will resolve the issues you have raised."

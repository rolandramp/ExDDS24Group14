    "title": "LLC Credit Card Debt and Debt Collections",
    "question": "I am a member of an LLC which is no longer in business as of 2009. After liquidating, I settled with all the LLC creditors except one credit card. The credit card co. refused to settle with amount we offer (1/3 of the original owed). But that is all that is remaining from LLC. The credit card co. wrote off the debt and the debt collection agency threatens to sue me personally, saying that I am still responsible. The credit card is in LLC name with me as an authorize user. Can I file bankruptcy just for the LLC?",

        "You cannot file bankruptcy just on one debt.\n\nWhen you file Bankruptcy you create a financial estate. That estate is “administered” by a Trustee. There are very different paths to the same outcome if you file a Chapter “7” or a Chapter “13” Bankruptcy, but the result is the same: you get rid of “unsecured” and maybe other kinds of debt.\nBankruptcy is filed by creating and filing a Petition. In the Petition you list all of your assets and income for the household; and all of the debts and obligations for that property or person who is filing.\nAfter everything is listed your attorney applies “exemptions” to the property. Exemptions are creatures of State law in New York. Quite simply, they are the “things you get to keep” as defined by specific statues and laws.\nEXEMPTIONS\nThere are many exemptions. It does not matter if a person files a Chapter 7 or a Chapter 13 Bankruptcy. These exemptions apply to all cases:\nHomestead exemption: This is where the homeowner who is on the Deed and living in the property gets to protect $50,000.00 (in New York…other States Vary!!!)each (up to two) of equity in the property. So, if one person is on the Deed and they live in the house and the home is worth $50,000.00 and is paid off, they get to keep the home and no one can try and take it if they file Bankruptcy. If two people are on the Deed and reside in the home the house can be paid off and worth $100,000.00 and nothing will happen to it if they file a Bankruptcy.\nPersonal property: The vast majority of people do not have to worry about losing property when they file Bankruptcy. However, it is your obligation to report all property. Most people’s furniture, bedroom sets, dining room sets, clothes, etc. are normal consumer items that we list, but since the PERSONAL PROPERTY EXEMPTION IN NEW YORK IS $10,000.00 DOLLARS (In New York…check your State) we have found that it is not worth the trouble by the Trustee appointed to oversee your Bankruptcy to take and sell the property.\nDON’T:\nTake out a second mortgage to pay credit cards;\nTransfer property to family members or friends to “protect it”;\nTake money out of your retirement account to pay credit cards.\nREQUEST: Please give this answer a \"thumbs up\"(below) if you find it valuable.\nDisclaimer: This answer does not constitute legal advice. I am admitted in the States of New York, New Jersey and Massachusetts only and make no attempt to opine on matters of law that are not relevant to those three States.

        "You cannot rely on a credit report for a legal status of your debts. Although the credit report may say that the debt is a \"charge off\" that phrase does not mean that the creditor wrote off the debt. It only means that the debt is more than 120 days delinquent. It doesn't protect you if the creditor sues you.\n\nIn most LLCs, the members personally guaranted payment of any credit extended to the business. So if the LLC files bankruptcy, the creditor can still look to you for payment.\n\nSorry to have to deliver this bad news, but you need to know the truth! Good luck!",
        "Whether you are personally liable for that credit card debt depends on the wording in the credit agreement that you signed. If you are personally liable, then a bankruptcy for the LLC wouldn't protect you from that debt; a personal bankruptcy would be required to do that. Also, if the LLC has been legally dissolved, there may be no reason to file bankruptcy for that entity. In any event, I recommend that you consult with a qualified bankruptcy attorney in your area to explore your situation."

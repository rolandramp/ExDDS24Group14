    "question": "If a creditor discharges an account, how much time do they have to collect? Can they try to collect five years from the discharge?",
    "answers": [
        "I am not sure what you mean by the creditor \"discharges.\" Normally, that phrase is used for bankruptcy under Chapter 7. If a debt is discharged by bankruptcy, it is no longer enforceable. Normally, when there is a written contract, the lawsuit must be filed within four years from the date of the default or the last payment on the account, whichever is later. All other contracts, such as oral contracts, are two years. If the debt is on a contract which has a shorter statute of limitations, then California would apply the shorter limitations period. Even if the statute of limitations has expired, a collector can still try to contact you, they just cannot file a lawsuit or threaten to sue you, if the debt is a \"consumer debt.\" There is no limitations period on most government-guaranteed student loans.\n\nI have been representing consumers on bad debts since 1997.

        "The Statute of Limitations is 4 years from date account is due or date of last payment, whichever is later.

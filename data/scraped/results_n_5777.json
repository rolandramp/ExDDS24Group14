    "question": "I have car registration fees for 3 cars in my business. The total amount is $3200. My first car had its fees incurred 4 years ago. And my other cars had both of their fees incurred around last year. Would any of these fees be dischargeable in bankruptcy?",

        "I agree. Atty. Herbert raises some good points, but read them in conjunction with the responses to your other post on this same subject.",
        "I practice bankruptcy in Illinois and Kentucky. Your question in part depends on California law so I cannot be sure. I would recommend speaking to a California bankruptcy attorney. I believe that this obligation will not be discharged. First if you do not pay the registration fees the vehicles will not be registered. This means it would be illegal to drive them and probably also means you could not properly insure them. It seems to me that vehicle registration is part of the state's police and regulatory powers and bankruptcy cannot undermine those public functions.\nIt may be different if those fees are for prior years and you did not pay them and you no longer have the vehicles. Then the issue looks more like debt collection and less like law enforcement. In any event if you want safe harbor and you are filing for bankruptcy relief anyway, you could only be sure where you stand by filing an adversary proceeding (a lawsuit) within your bankruptcy case where you name the State agency that levies those fees as defendant. Your complaint would be a complaint to determine the dischargeability of a debt. You would assert that this obligation is a debt and that you believe it does not fall within any stated exception to discharge and you ask to have a trial of the matter before the bankruptcy judge. If the judge rules it is dischargeable, then it is."

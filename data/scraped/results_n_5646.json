        "You can assign rights and liabilities. For assigning liabilities you need to have consent of other person ( like written) otherwise it won't be valid. But, you will be still liable secondarily as surety or guarantor.",
        "The analysis is that it can probably be done as some \"hybrid\" arrangement Your use of the term \"but not liability\" is unclear. Trade debtrs are one form of liability.\n\nWhat you are seeking, however, is advice about how to do it. My clients usually come to me with the elements of the deal. Even more important than knowing how to draft what they want into the contract, I can also recognize (often) what is missing. This is based on interviewing the client and the specific facts.

        "I do not see how anyone can assume the control of someone else's business without being considered an employee. One of the key factors that makes a person an employee rather than an independent contractor is whether the person is acting in the principal's primary business. A contractor who assumes control of the entire business will necessarily be doing so.",
        "I agree with Mr. Doland. Avvo forums are for analysis, not advice and what you need is advice. I suggest you find a local business lawyer to discuss exactly what you want and the reasons why you want such arrangement. Depending on the type of business you are in, a properly written contract may accomplish the job, or you might be better served by forming an appropriate business entity.\n\nMatthew Blair\nwww.beverlyhillsbusinesslawyers.com"

        "Assuming yours was a \"no asset\" case, send the creditor and/or their attorney a letter (w/copy of discharge) stating that their's was a prepetition debt and per In re Beezley, 994 F.2d 1433 (9th Cir. 1993) it is considered discharged. Additionally, now that they have notice, any further attempt to collect will be a violation of your bankruptcy discharge per 362 of the Bankruptcy Code, blah, blah, blah.\n\nIf you want to email me I'll send you a copy of my standard letter.\n\nGood luck!\n\n\nRob Taylor\nwww.affordableattorneysgroup.com",
        "In re Neilsen, 383 F.2d 922 (9th Cir. 2004) and In re Beezley, 994 F.2d 1433 (9th Cir. 1993) protect you in this situation. Like my colleague properly stated, simply send creditor copy of your notice of filing and discharge, and if they had no ground to object, they are discharged as well.",
        "I doubt you need to do such a thing. Just because you forget to list a debtor, doesn't mean that debt was discharged. Were there any assets distributed by the trustee in your case? If not, I would simply send the creditor and their attorney a copy of the discharge order."

        "I would highly recommend contacting my receptionist, I would love to help you in any way I can.",
        "Yes. The automatic stay enacted when you file your bankruptcy case protects you from all debt collection efforts (including garnishment) while your case moves through the court system.",
        "Yes. Filing BK will stop the garnishment, at least temporarily. If taxes are dischargeable, they will be discharged in BK. If non-dischargeable, garnishment will resume upon IRS obtaining relief from automatic stay or after case is closed. If some or all taxes non-dischargeable, you may benefit from C13 BK. Review all tax records and facts with BK counsel before determining if BK is best option.",
        "It will temporarily stop the wage assignment, but it may resume after your BK is closed if the taxes are not discharged. There are many factors to consider when determining the dischargability taxes. You need to consult with an experienced BK attorney. There's too much to discuss to get any good offhand advice here.\n\nRob",
        "As the other attorneys have stated, filing bankruptcy will stop the garnishment right away and there will be no garnishment for the duration of your bankruptcy.\nYou may be able to eliminate the tax debt if it is older than 3 years, its personal income tax, and you filed your tax returns on time. This is assuming the IRS does not have a secured lien against you. Make sure to consult an experienced bankruptcy attorney so they can review your tax documents to advise you whether or not the tax debt will be eliminated and what chapter - chapter 7 or chapter 13 would be best for your situation.",
        "The best advice we can give you is to consult with an experienced, local bankruptcy attorney who can review your situation in more detail and advise you based on the results of that conversation.",
        "The garnishment would start as soon as you file the case. Practically speaking, you want to file in enough time to inform your payroll department so they can stop the garnishment.\n\nHowever, be very careful with assuming the taxes are dischargeable. Timing is very important and there are lots of dangers in this area. In addition to needing to have been due at least three years ago, there are requirements for filing of the taxes, for recent assessments, and if the IRS has filed a lien against you that could affect things as well. You don't want to jump into a chapter 7 cases just to know you'll be back in the garnishment four months later when the case ends. There could be timing issues that help you in a chapter 7, or reasons to file a chapter 13.\n\nThe simple answer is the garnishment will stop as soon as you file and inform payroll. The more important answer is to be careful with this area and seek a consultation, particularly as it appears there are a large amount of back taxes due.\n\nHope this helps!",

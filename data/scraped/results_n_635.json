    "title": "I need to know if it is a good idea for me to file personal bankruptcy",
    "question": "A year ago I decided to go with National Debt Relief to help with all my personal credit cards. After a year they contacted me and said I was doing so good that a third party wanted to step in and finish paying out the few credit cards I had left. Well I said yes... I should not have. The beginning debt was around 47,000.00. The credit cards settled with 20,000.00. Now the 3rd party wants a 60 month contract which will end up making me pay 48,000.00. I made a huge mistake in going this route. Is there anything I can do?",
    "answers": [
        "Consult with a local bankruptcy attorney. Most offer a free consultation.",
        "It sounds like the \"third party\" is a lender, who is seeking to pay off your existing debt and charge you interest over 5 years. First of all, I do not think you should take on a new debt to replace your old credit card debt. I would question what was done with the $20,000 that you paid to the debt settlement company, and why the amount being paid off is just $1,000 less than the original debt amount. I strongly suspect that the debt settlement firm has used most of the money to pay itself, and now wants to avoid having to actually settle your debts. To me this means that you have not benefited at all from their services. Companies like this, that promise consumers an easy way to pay off debts and avoid bankruptcy, are simply a RIPOFF\n\nSecondly, consider that you may not need to pay any interest on your outstanding debt. If you get a new loan with the \"third party\" you will be paying interest. Also, consider that if you stopped paying on the credit cards a few years ago, some of your debts may now be \"time-barred\" (too old for the filing of a collection lawsuit).\nYou should pay nothing to those creditors.\n\nConsider terminating the agreement with the debt settlement company and going forward on your own. It sounds like they are doing nothing for you, and if you wanted to actually settle your debts by making monthly payments to creditors, you could do that on your own. If you get sued by a creditor, contact a debt collection defense attorney, or a bankruptcy attorney.",
        "I am sorry you have had this experience with the debt consolidation company. Filing for bankruptcy protection and relief may still be an option, depending. Since we don’t know anything about your household income, budget, your assets and available exemptions, and more, you will need to have a consultation with a bankruptcy lawyer first to help analyze and determine if filing for chapter 7 or chapter 13 would be a strong option.\n\nBest of luck"

    "title": "Can Restitution be changed based on marriage? Does the spouse then inherit that debt.",
    "question": "My girlfriend has a rather large restitution that will probably take her whole life to pay off. It was long before I had even met her. What should be my concerns in this debt if we were to ever get married? Would the court be able to raise the monthly amount she would have to pay and would they also be able to go after me based on my income? This is my first step in finding out more information, so I apologize for my ignorance all around.",
    "answers": [
        "The obligation to pay restitution is her separate debt. It does not become yours when you marry. However, once you marry, her obligation to continue paying the debt remains and your household income (i.e. your income if you work) becomes something she can legally use to continue making payments. However, it never becomes your debt alone. Can the court increase the monthly payments after you two marry? No, not unless her pay increases or she inherits money.",
        "This is a question to be answered by a family law attorney as it has to do with community v. separate property debts.",
        "Contact a family law attorney. The debt does not become your's but as the family income grows, she is essentially expected to pay more or at least maintain tre currently set payment amount."

        "You do not need to obtain and record an abstract of judgment, unless you believe that the defendant owns real property in the county, such as a residence or vacant lot. If they don't then save the money and simply garnish the wages using the judicial council forms, which must be stamped by the clerk of the court and then sent for enforcement to the Sheriff's civil department, where the employer is located.\n\nRobert Stempler (please see DISCLAIMER below)\nwww.StopCollectionLawsuits.com\nwww.facebook.com/SoCalConsumerLawyer\nTwitter: @RStempler",
        "First, you need a Writ of Excution from the court. They won't care what you intend you to use it for. Take the original writ and several copies to the Sheriff's department. Keep copes for yourself too. You need to pay a fee and complete an application for earnings withholding order. The sheriff will take care of the rest. You keep copies of the writ if you need to do something else such as banke levy.\n\nYou don't need an abstract for a wage garnishment. However, you can record the abstract at the county recorder's office and put a lien on any land they might own in the county where is has been recorded.",
        "According to the California Courts website:\n\nIf the debtor is employed, you can get an Earnings Withholding Order to garnish the debtor's wages until you are paid. You have the right to collect up to 25 percent of the amount over the federal minimum wage that the debtor earns (as long as it is not exempt under other rules). This only works if the other person is employed by someone else. A wage garnishment does not work against someone who is self-employed.\n\n1. Ask the court to issue a Writ of Execution (Form EJ-130). (See link below to learn how to ask for a Writ of Execution.)\n2. Prepare an Application for Earnings Withholding Order (Wage Garnishment) (Form WG-001).\n3. Hire a process server or the sheriff/marshal to serve the employer with the necessary papers for the wage garnishment.\n4. The process server or sheriff/marshal will usually fill out the Earnings Withholding Order (Form WG-002) using the information from the Writ of Execution. But you may have to fill it out yourself. This form has instructions on the back for the employer explaining how much money to garnish (take) from the debtor's wages.\n5. The process server or sheriff/marshal must also serve the employer with the Employer's Return (Wage Garnishment) (Form WG-005) and Employee Instructions (Wage Garnishment) (Form WG-003). You may have to provide these forms to the process server or sheriff/marshal.\n\nThe debtor has 10 days to file a Claim of Exemption (Form WG-006) . If the debtor does file this claim, you have the right to oppose it. Click to learn about a Claim of Exemption for wage garnishments and how to oppose it."

        "You should no matter what NOT rely on this answer but meet with an experienced bankruptcy and trust attorney to make sure on legal advice. I found this answer and so well stated I will quote it:\n\nIn general :\n\nIf you are the beneficiary of a trust, and are considering filing for bankruptcy, you might be wondering if you will lose your interest in the trust to your creditors. The answer to this question depends, first, on whether the trust is a “spendthrift trust” under the law of the state which governs the trust, and second, if the trust contains no valid spendthrift clause, on whether there is an exemption which can be used to protect your interest in the trust.\n\nThe law states that a trust becomes property of the bankruptcy estate, unless the trust contains a spendthrift clause enforceable under state law. If so, section 541(c)(2) of the bankruptcy law excludes the trust from the bankruptcy estate, and therefore it is protected. This means your bankruptcy lawyer will need to carefully examine the terms of the trust to see whether it contains a spendthrift clause.\n\nNext, your lawyer will need to determine which state’s law governs the trust, and whether the trust’s spendthrift clause was properly drafted so as to be enforceable. This may a matter of interpreting complex trust law unique to the state involved. Your bankruptcy lawyer may need to seek an opinion from an experienced trust lawyer in order to answer this question.\n\nIf the trust contains a valid spendthrift clause, your worries are over, because your interest in the trust is excluded from the bankruptcy estate and you cannot lose it. However, if there is no spendthrift clause, or if the spendthrift clause is defective in some way so as to render it uneforceable under the law of the state involved, your interest in the trust will be lost unless you can claim it exempt.\n\nIn addition to the trust other issues may exist as I set forth below also:\n\nYou need and want to enjoy your fresh start also. But the most important thing is to meet with an attorney as you asking this question means you have not. You care about 2 goals: keeping everything you have equity in and discharging all your debts. If you don't have any of the exceptions to discharge you will obtain that goal; most exceptions are set forth in 11 USC. 523 (Google it) like child support, some income taxes, traffic (in a ch 7) and criminal fines , and presumption of student loans. But some debts are dischargeable in a ch 13 but NOT in a ch 7 so you want to make sure and your attorney will discuss any such types with you also!\n\nYour exemptions depend on what state you have lived in in the last 2 years and thus if in your state, then your states exemptions will apply. Most persons filing keep everything they own but your attorney will confirm that with you when they learn everything you own and the equity thereof!\n\nSome secured debts like homes, vehicles, other secured debts an attorney will discuss your options on also as you must list any debts; but that does not mean you will lose them unless you have too much equity or are in default on paying for them! Discuss those options if they apply with your attorney too.\n\nBut other issues can arise that can greatly harm your case. Just one example: If you paid back a relative $3,000 11 months ago and now file bankruptcy next week, the trustee can SUE that relative to retrieve that $3,000 (under what is called a preference) for the benefit of the bankruptcy estate. As a result, most attorneys don't charge to meet with them the first meeting so meet with one no matter what.\n\nMany great attorneys can be found right here on AVVO in your state so look, call, and meet one as soon as you can.\n\nYou should also want to know when to file: is there an advantage of waiting versus filing now and who should you pay between now and then! Good luck and enjoy your later fresh start."

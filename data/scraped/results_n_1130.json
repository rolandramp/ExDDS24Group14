        "I am not certain what the defamation claim is all about but in recent days it has become a very difficult tort to prove.\n\nNonetheless the view point of the plaintiff side is they want to win a lot of money, including the possibility of punitive damages.\n\nIf I were you, I would sell my home and get the equity out now, THe balance would be used for living expenses and ordinary expenses, including legal fees.\n\nIf you win the case, they owe you your costs and possibly attorney fees if there is a basis to claim it either in contract, by statute or by law.\n\nWinning defamation cases on the plaintiff side is usually highly uncertain unless you have a great deal of evidence that there was an actionable defamation. There are also issues of privilege and truth as defenses. And finally, damages.\n\nDepending on how strong a defense you have, a plaintiff may be inclined to settle rather than go to trial. For how much depends on how ticked off they are and how much they have invested in their case.\n\nWithout more information it would take a crystal ball to predict what your plaintiff is looking for to resolve the case amicably.\n\nNow for another part. Defamation is usually not dischargable in a bankruptcy case as it falls into wilful and malicious acts (11 USC 523(a)(6)). Therefore a Ch. 7 may not be an option but a 13 might be.\n\nI would not run to bankruptcy without the assistance of a seasoned bankruptcy lawyer. It could prove to be a trap. Here's how. You file before they get a judgment, in a Ch. 7 they can file an adversary proceeding to determine that the nature of the debt is non-dischargeable.. In a case like that, you end up with collateral estoppel going back t the state court which means now there is a finding of liability with the state court determining damages.\n\nAgain, its tricky. Don't do it without a seasoned attorney.",
        "Before looking into Bankruptcy you need to speak to an experienced attorney pertaining to the defamation cause of action. As suggested in prior comments it is a very difficult tort to prove and an experienced attorney will know whether the lawsuit holds water and what defenses are available. If the claim for defamation is not substantiated and/or strong, there are certain steps that an experienced attorney can take to prevent the lawsuit from moving forward at an early stages of such a lawsuit, and potentially you might be entitled to attorney's fees. However, you must speak to an attorney this is not an easy matter.",
        "Hopefully you have counsel in this defamation lawsuit. I recommend that you also speak to an experienced bankruptcy attorney and request that he/she get factual information from your lawsuit attorney so that you can be properly advised.\n\nIf a defamation action is something the plaintiff can win, they can probably make that judgment nondischargeable under the Bankruptcy Code. Section 523(a)(6) involved \"willful and malicious injury\" to another person. Defamation would likely fit into this category, depending on the facts. If the state court enters a judgment with a finding of facts that fits the definition of \"willful and malicious\" under the Bankruptcy Code, it is almost certain that if the plaintiff moves forward with an Adversary Proceeding (lawsuit) in the Bankruptcy case, that judgment will be adopted by the court and made nondischargeable. There might be an advantage in filing before a judgment is obtained, since some plaintiffs are unwilling to pursue this in bankruptcy court.\n\nThere is a time limit that is set for the plaintiff to take action, which is usually about 90 days after filing. If they don't file the Adversary, the debt is discharged.\n\nYou also mentioned that you may have assets that aren't exempt. You need to consult with an attorney to explore that issue.\n\nFinally, also discuss chapter 13. While the debt has the same dischargeability issues in chapter 13, it is even less likely that the case will be pursued if you are paying something to general unsecured creditors. That may be the best option to get the best \"deal\" from this plaintiff.",
        "You need to seek counsel and advice from an attorney who is familiar with defense of such suits to analyze your opponent's allegations against you. It is rarely wise to ever run to Bankruptcy before a claim has ripened into action! Do you have other debts, or is this fear of suit the only debt you are concerned about? Everyone here agrees that obtaining a Plaintiff judgment is very difficult to do in defamation cases. It doesn't appear that you have been sued yet. As mentioned by my other esteemed colleagues, Mr. Elie and Mr. Boyer, Bankruptcy can become a trap. It may also be useful. You might be able to defend yourself better in a Chapter 13, and pay much less than you would lose if the plaintiff were win a valid case. There are tools in Chapter 13 not available in Chapter 7.

One thing for sure...do not discuss the details of your concerns with your opponent over social media or with anybody other than your attorney!!\nI will recommend that you seek counsel from a Bankruptcy attorney first, and he/she may refer you to a defense attorney if you really need one.

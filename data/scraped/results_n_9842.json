    "title": "We have $60,000 in debt, should we file BK....and can I keep some cards and file on some?",
    "question": "My husband and I have a combined total credit card debt of almost $60,000. I carry about 40k he has the remainder. We have our primary 535K mortgage which is on a pay-option-arm loan, which we are trying to negotiate, a heloc of 155k that we haven't paid on since august. I was in real estate doing fairly ok, but this year after having about 9 escrows fall out and getting a paycheck for the first time in June this year, we've exhausted our savings and have been living on credit card. Fortunately we have no 30 day lates on the credit card but we 1 on our mortgage. Oh yeah we have a rental property in Arizona, thats vacant and we haven't paid on that since July. The only mortgage in my name is the 1st for our primary residence. The heloc and rental is in my husbands name. I have now gone back to my former job, prior to real estate, bringing home about 3,400 a month and my husband brings home 4,800 a month....which is still not enough to pay our bills. The credit card interest rates are all between 21% and 29%, when we make a payment of 320 only about 150 goes to principal, it seems we'll never pay it off, unless my real estate picks up. Oh yeah one more thing, I'm leasing a car (mercedes, that I wish I can return) which will be over in May 2010, and I need to buy a car.....should I purchase a car now and file BK in about 2 mos. I do the finances and my husband has said we should just file BK, I've been saying lets just try and pay, but realistically we keep getting the phone, lights, or water shut off almost every other month, and I'm extremely stressed. Will they say I can't have a car? Do I file 7 or 13? Can I file on only a portion of my credit cards and keep some?",

        "Whether you can file a Ch. 7 at all depends on your total household income. There is a threshhold currently for Chapter 7, which is based on your annual income calculated for the 6 months immediately prior to the month of filing, then doubled. There is a chart for each state, based on median income. If your income exceeds the chart you are not normally eligible for Ch. 7 so if so, Ch. 13 is probably your only option. The formula used to determine whether you would be over or under is called a Means Test.\n\nIf you buy a car shortly prior to filing bankruptcy,the creditor can claim that you got the loan under false pretenses.\n\nFor California, the Means Test ceilings are:\n\nCalifornia $47,363 $62,690 $68,070 $77,014 - read from left to right. The first total is for a one person household, the second number for two, etc.\n\nIf you file Chapter 13, they give you an allowable budget, based on the average expenses in your area, and that is all you can spend - anything more you make has to go into your Ch. 13 plan.\n\nIf you can stand to wait, there may be serious improvement coming after the new President and Congress are sworn in in January 2009. There has been considerable talk about changes. The law is currently very onerous, due to the revisions made in 2005.",
        "Re: the portion of your question about filing on only some credit cards, you must list all debt on your petition, but can reaffirm something after the filing. I'm not sure why you would want to on an unsecured debt. If you have a credit card without a balance that might be different.",
        "You have a rather compled situation which involves several issues:\n\n1. You own a home which you want to protect.\n2. You have a second property which is not exempt.\n3. You may or may not have income that precludes you from filing for Chapter 7 under the means test\n4. You have a car which you want to surrender\n5. You are considering obtaining a new car before filing\n\nBased on all of these issues, there is no way to give you an easy answer, as the advice is very dependant upon more specific facts that you don't indicate.\n\nMost bankruptcy attorneys provide for a free consultation. I would urge you to consult with an experience bankruptcy attorney who should be able to give you the advice and guidance that you need."

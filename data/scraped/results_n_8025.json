        "In Chapter 11 bankruptcy, individual employees may make a priority claim for wages earned up to 180 days prior to the filing of the bankruptcy petition for up to $10,000.\n\nAn independent contractor is not generally considered an employee and must make a claim under the bankruptcy as any other creditor would to claim a pro-rata share of any repayment to creditors made in the Chapter 11.\n\nA number of other factors will also affect the above considerations such as, most commonly, any willful failure to pay wages owed prior to the filing of the bankruptcy petition.\n\nPlease be aware, to determine what rights you have with respect to your specific situation in the debtor’s Chapter 11, please contact a local bankruptcy attorney as soon as possible!",
        "Like the others, I agree you should file a proof of claim. I can't say that this will guarantee that you will be paid anything, though. If you were an employee, rather than an independent contractor, your wages would have been considered as a priority claim & would be paid first. However, as an independent contractor, you have to wait for payment with most other creditors, who are last on the list.\n\nHope this perspective helps!",
        "You need to file a Proof of Claim for the monies you are owed.\n\nWhen filing a Proof of Claim, be sure to attach photocopies of supporting documents to the original Proof of Claim form (NOTE: Do not send the “original” copies of the supporting documentation). A creditor may also send to the clerk’s office a letter with the creditor’s name and address, the debtor's name and bankruptcy case number, the amount owed to the creditor, the type of claim (secured, unsecured, priority), the date the debt was incurred, and any documentation that supports the claim.\n\nA creditor may need to file a Proof of Claim with the court within 90 days of the first date set for the 341(a) Meeting of Creditors, and possibly even earlier. To be aware of the applicable deadline, refer to Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure Rule 3002(c) and check for relevant court orders in the bankruptcy docket for the debtor who owes the money. An original and one copy of the Proof of Claim are required. If a creditor wishes to receive a conformed copy of the Proof of Claim, enclose one extra copy of the Proof of Claim and a self-addressed, stamped envelope.",
        "You are a creditor like other creditors. Make sure you file a proof of claim in that bankruptcy case. I recommend that you contact a qualified bankruptcy attorney in your area, one who has dealt with Chapter 11 cases."

        "Benjamin Heston's practical suggestion is the best approach. There is no published opinion that supports the position that toll road fees are non-dischargeable. Quite a few years back, in a non-published memorandum, Judge Jame Barr of the Santa Ana Division of the Central District of California came to the conclusion that such assessments were non-dischargeable. But since the memorandum was not published nor was it an appellate decision, it did not constitute a precedent that could be cited as controlling authority. It was binding only in Judge Barr's courtroom. Judge Bar retired from the bench in 2006. He's in great health and enjoying retirement. I know because we recently met for lunch. I doubt that he gives the car pool lanes fees much thought, and the decision is no longer a concern since his courtroom assignment has long since been filled by another judge, who has never opined on the subject.",
        "Government debts are generally not able to be discharged in Chapter 7. Having said that , they still need to be listed on appropriate schedules. I would suggest asking the collecting agency to zero out the account as well.",
        "Debts you describe are unsecured non-priority debts.\nDischargeable in C7 BK.",
        "I would have to agree with the other answers on here that this would be non-dischargeable. HOWEVER, I fairly recently had a case where my client owed $10k+ for toll road violations. After he received his discharge, I called the Toll Roads and requested that they zero-out his balance, AND THEY DID! That will not be the result is every case though.",
        "Attorney Gist states it as is! You have 2 CA attorneys , who I recognize both from their many excellent and correct and complete answers on AVVO here for you and have done so over the years! Because you are asking that question implies you have NOT met with an experienced attorney like them. DO so now! Not to is a grave mistake. But there are other issues and facts that can affect your situation very much, some of which I will point out some next. Why? To create in your mind why you really want to meet an attorney in person who knows what they are doing and explaining all in a manner you can understand the move forward on the option you desire!\n\nYou need and want to enjoy your fresh start also. But the most important thing is to meet with an attorney as you asking this question means you have not. You care about 2 goals: keeping everything you have equity in and discharging all your debts. If you don't have any of the exceptions to discharge you will obtain that goal; most exceptions are set forth in 11 USC. 523 (Google it) like child support, some income taxes, traffic (in a ch 7) and criminal fines , and presumption of student loans. But some debts are dischargeable in a ch 13 but NOT in a ch 7 so you want to make sure and your attorney will discuss any such types with you also!\n\nYour exemptions depend on what state you have lived in in the last 2 years and thus if in your state, then your states exemptions will apply. Most persons filing keep everything they own but your attorney will confirm that with you when they learn everything you own and the equity thereof!\n\nSome secured debts like homes, vehicles, other secured debts an attorney will discuss your options on also as you must list any debts; but that does not mean you will lose them unless you have too much equity or are in default on paying for them! Discuss those options if they apply with your attorney too.\n\nBut other issues can arise that can greatly harm your case. Just one example: If you paid back a relative $3,000 11 months ago and now file bankruptcy next week, the trustee can SUE that relative to retrieve that $3,000 (under what is called a preference) for the benefit of the bankruptcy estate. As a result, most attorneys don't charge to meet with them the first meeting so meet with one no matter what.\n\nMany great attorneys can be found right here on AVVO in your state so look, call, and meet one as soon as you can.\n\nYou should also want to know when to file: is there an advantage of waiting versus filing now and who should you pay between now and then! Good luck and enjoy your later fresh start.",
        "They are not dischargeable in a Chapter 7.",
        "In Chapter 7 they would be treated as unsecured debts but not dischargeable.",
        "You will not be able to discharge these debts in a Chapter 7, but it is quite possible that a Chapter 13, with the limited \"Super-discharge\", would enable you to discharge a part of it. We cannot know how much, because we need to have many more questions answered, such as how much your household income is and what your expenses happen to be. We do not even know if you are qualified for a Chapter 7 or a Chapter 13, so why not take advantage of the free consultations many of your local attorneys offer in Orange County.

        "Government debts are typically not discharged in Chapter 7. Chapter 13 however has a more generous discharge scope. If it's any sort of criminal fine, it won't be discharged anywhere, but if it's just a fine, 13 should handle it okay without even having to pay it in full.",
        "It won't be eligible to be discharged. My experience is that these debts are treated just like debt to FTB - you have to pay no matter what. Hope this perspective helps!"

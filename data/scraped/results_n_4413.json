        "The IRS has a pretty good explanation of their record keeping guidelines on their website. If you Google \"IRS Record Retention\" you'll get links to the IRS website. In short, their requirements vary depending upon your tax filing status. This page - http://www.irs.gov/Businesses/Small-Businesses-&-Self-Employed/How-long-should-I-keep-records - has a good decision tree for records retention. Is the IRS the only concern when considering records retention? No - you need to be concerned with the Statute of Limitations for claims by tenants. Generally speaking, they are going to be four years or less. And, you also need to be concerned with certain ADA statutes of limitations which can be longer. Seven years, as suggested in the previous response is the safest policy. Also look on the IRS' website for information concerning electronic records retention - you may wish, after a certain period of time, to convert the records to electronic records.\n\nDavid L.

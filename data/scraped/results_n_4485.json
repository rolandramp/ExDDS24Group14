    "title": "What happens if I don't show up to a court hearing on a collection case suit?",
    "question": "I have been back and forth with a collection agency that is suing me o an account they bought from the creditor I took out the account with. Hoping they would want to try to settle with me out of court I have gone this long. But the hearing date is set for this Thursday and I am no where near ready or prepared for it. And before I get the obvious response from one of you about \"pay my bills and things won't come to this\", please don't judge for you don't know the whole story and obviously it is too much to put out on this forum. Just want to know what would happen. I've heard that in a nutshell, the judge would rule against me but then what? What would happen after that?",

        "If this is a debt buyer case, you need to hire a debt defense lawyer and it is never too late. I have subbed in on the day of trial and either tried it right then or got it continued. These cases can be won by competent counsel. Rarely can a pro se debtor defendant win his/her own case. I say this not just because of the general rule that a fool represents himself. I say this because if you are present at trial (which you must be if you are your own lawyer) you will be called as a witness and you will probably prove up the debt buyers case for them. the debt buyers problem is proving up the case properly. When the debtor is in court, the debt buyer case is easily proved.",
        "Without your posting being clear what hearing is next week, I would not know what will occur if you fail to show. If this is simply a hearing to set the trial date, you will not be able to give input on what date is convenient and how long the trial will take and if you need a jury, for which you may need to post the $150 advanced fee to ensure you get. Some judges will sanction a party for failing to appear at a hearing, others simply proceed and you receive a notice of what was done at the hearing. If this is trial, failure to appear does not automatically mean you will lose, perhaps the Plaintiff will also not appear. It happens from time to time or perhaps the Plaintiff will still not convince the judge that they are entitled to a judgment. You should consult with an experienced debt collection DEFENSE attorney in deciding what you should do.\n\nRobert Stempler (please see DISCLAIMER below)\nwww.StopCollectionLawsuits.com\nwww.facebook.com/SoCalConsumerLawyer\nTwitter: @RStempler",
        "You'll lose, the court will enter a judgment, and then the creditor will start collection actions - bank levies, wage garnishment, etc.",
        "Don't show up and the creditor will get a default judgment. With a default judgment, the creditor can then garnish wages, levy bank accounts, and/or lien up properties. If you cannot pay, then consider consulting with a bankruptcy attorney. If you can pay a portion of what is owed, then consider consulting with a debt settlement attorney to handle your litigation matter."

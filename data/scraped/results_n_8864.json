        "Under California law, you are not required to have any sort of card to use medicinal marijuana. You need a recommendation from a physician, which is not a public record.\n\nHowever, you still run the risk of arrest and prosecution if you are caught with medicinal cannabis. Your physician's recommendation is a defense to the charges, not a \"get out of jail free\" card.\n\nMost drug convictions guarantee your deportation, especially if they involve any sort of trafficking. However, legal residents are eligible for cancellation of removal if their only drug conviction is for possession of less than an ounce of marijuana.\n\nMy advice: you're better off not risking it... but if you do, make sure you have a written recommendation from a physician.\n\nKeep in mind that marijuana may become legal under California law if an initiative on the November ballot passes. If it passes, it's unlikely the Feds will come in to prosecute people with small amounts of marijuana.\n\nPlease understand that this is a general discussion of legal principles by a California lawyer and does not create an attorney/client relationship. It's impossible to give detailed, accurate advice based on a few sentences on a website (and you shouldn't provide too much specific information about your legal matter on a public forum like this site, anyway). You should always seek advice from an attorney licensed in your jurisdiction who can give you an informed opinion after reviewing all of the relevant information.",

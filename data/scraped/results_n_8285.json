        "In most states, case management conferences are discussions about time and deadlines. So the Court might wish to schedule a time for a trial, schedule a time for discovery to take place, a deadline for motions to take place. Once you file your bankruptcy, you should let this court know about the bankruptcy so that they can cancel any further activities.\n\nHope this perspective helps!",
        "If your attorney can file the bankruptcy papers before the CMC and file notice with the court, then you would not need to appear or file any papers with the court. Otherwise, perhaps you can appear by Courtcall, which is about $75, but it will save you a trip to the court. Or appear in person. You can then advise the court that you are filing bankruptcy. Sometimes, not showing up means that the court sanctions that party. I doubt the court will sanction you, but sanctions are not discharged in bankruptcy.",
        "If you do not show up the court will schedule an Order to Show Cause why your answer should not be stricken and default entered against you.\n\nAs purpose of Case Management Conference is to find out status of case, best thing you can do is show up, let court know you are planning to file Chapter 7 by mid-February.\n\nWorst that happens is court sets trial date in 3-6 months. If you file BK you can serve Notice of Automatic Stay on Court and Plaintiff's counsel. If you do not, you know when your trial is.\n\nYou should also fill out same Form CM-110 and bring original and 2 copies to Court for your CMC hearing.\n\n\nThe response given is not intended to create, nor does it create an ongoing duty to respond to questions. The response does not form an attorney-client relationship, nor is it intended to be anything other than the educated opinion of the author. It should not be relied upon as legal advice. The response given is based upon the limited facts provided by the person asking the question. To the extent additional or different facts exist, the response might possibly change.

    "title": "Pro and cons of filing divorce in Illinois or California",
    "question": "My wife and I have been living in California for many years. Recently, my wife left me and moved to Illinois. Both of us were born in Illinois, but haven't lived there in over a decade. My wife indicates that she wants to fill the divorce in Illinois and I think we should fill in California. She doesn't meet the 90 day residency requirement yet, so we have a bit of time to decide on the best state to fill. We have no children and on the verge of bankruptcy. So assets / debts are not a big deal either. We can cooperate in the process and want to know which state would be easiest and quickest to file in. Also are there significant difference is maintenance rules. Thanks.",

        "File in California. Doesn't sound like you will be fighting over anything since you have no children and are on the verge of BK, so I'm not sure that it makes a difference which state's laws apply. However, in case you do have to make a court appearance, you don't want to have to fly to Illinois to do that. Therefore, it's better for you to file here in LA. The matter can be resolved as an uncontested divorce but just in case it doesn't, you want it to be a local case. Your wife can appear for most court hearings by telephone if you file downtown.",
        "It would be foolish for any attorney here to answer your question without knowing the full extent of your assets and debts and knowing both California and Illinois law. It is virtually impossible to give solid legal advice on the facts presented. Perhaps you should see a lawyer here. She should see a lawyer there, and then compare notes. Alternatively, when you see the lawyer here, see if you can conference her in. The same when she sees the lawyer. Then you both have the same information. There obviously is no attorney-client confidentiality in this situation but it does put you both on even footing with the information you are seeking.",
        "I don't expect this is a question that can be answered unless the attorney answering this question happens to be familiar with both California and Illinois law. I am not one of those lawyers. I do know, however, that one major difference between CA and Illinois is that CA is a community property state. Illinois is not. I would suggest you look through the self-help pages in the LA Superior Court's web site and see if Illinois has something similar and then decide for yourself which state will facilitate an easier/faster path to divorce."

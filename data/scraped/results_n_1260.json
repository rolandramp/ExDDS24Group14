        "You need to file a claim of exemption with the Sheriff immediately. Otherwise, the Sheriff will send the money to the creditor. You should have an attorney review the relevant documents contained in the court's file. Were you named as a co-defendant in the underlying lawsuit?\n\nIf there was a Fair Debt Collection Act violation, you may be able to recover any damages, a statutory penalty and attorney's fees.",
        "First of all, in order to levy on what may be claimed as community property assets, the creditor must serve a declaration, under oath that the account being levied on is in fact community property. Or, you agreed to assume some portion of your ex-husband's debts; or that there was a fraudulent transfer of property to you based on some factual assertion. So you need to carefully scrutinize the declaration or affidavit attached to the levy papers. You can obtain that from both the bank and the sheriff's office.\n\nSecond, you have to act quickly. A Third Party claim has to be filed with the Sheriff's Office and then a request for hearing on third party claim has to be made within 15 days of filing with the Sheriff, and if you don't follow the statute properly, the trial court may lose jurisdiction over the Third Party Claim.\n\nThird, as explained below, the Third Party Claim may be your only remedy. Sadly California has serious issues about protecting the rights of innocent spouses and ex-spouses. The statutes are so poorly written in this respect that the Enforcement of Judgment Law makes it easy to collect from innocent and ex-spouses with impunity. I blame the banking lobby for this.\n\nFourth, moreover, the banks have no choice in the matter. If they refuse to release the levied funds to the Sheriff within a set period of time, they become liable for your ex-husband's debt and face attorney's fees and damages ontop of that due to another bank-friendly statute. So they will be more than cooperative in taking your money and handing it over.\n\nFifth, in addition to the foregoing, you must, absolutely MUST assert your personal exemptions to the levy. No ifs ands or butts.\n\nNow there are two avenues for you to proceed (I hate to say this but right now only one avenue appears viable):\n\n1. You file a Third Party Claim with the Sheriff pursuant to CCP 720.110, et seq. See code here:\n\nhttp://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=ccp&group=00001-01000&file=720.110-720.170\n\n2. Since your question hales from Irvine, you will have to request a copy of the form from the Orange County Sheriff's Office or you will have to draft one up in pleading format, or you may rely on the form I am providing below.\n\nI recommend the following form from another county, and you will have to alter it to correctly reflect the information such as Superior Court and Sheriff's Levy and other information. They (OC Sheriff) will accept this form.\n\nhttp://www.sacsheriff.com/pages/organization/correctionalcourt/documents/7483%20Form%20011-Third%20Party%20Claim%20Form.pdf\n\n3. You are not required to file a Third Party Claim but in OC Superior Court almost all the judges will rule that the failure to follow this procedure precludes you from recovering in a subsequent lawsuit because of the Special Motion to Strike Statute and you would likely lose your lawsuit unless you can prove a malicious prosecution, which is very hard to do under Rusheen's holding. Here is the Rusheen holding:\n\nhttps://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/2582746/rusheen-v-cohen/?\n\nMalicious Prosecution is even more daunting. See Paulus v. Bob Lynch Ford, Inc., link here:\n\nhttps://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/2305488/paulus-v-bob-lynch-ford-inc/?\n\n4. However, that does not relieve the party who outright lied to get the writ, or obtain your money. If you believe that the attorney or party responsible for getting this writ issued outright lied to get the writ issued, that is committed outright perjury, there is a theft statute in place to cover that as there is no lawful right to intentionally commit a crime and obtain money or property through false pretenses. That statute provides for treble damages and attorney fees. Once again you have to prove outright perjury to do this. One thing that can happen is that if the District Attorney is convinced that this is a perjury case, then yes, if charged that would meet the threshhold to avoid an Anti-SLAPP motion. See Pen. Code 496(c).",

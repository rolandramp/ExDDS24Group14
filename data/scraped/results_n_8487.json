        "As you may know, Chapter 7 and Chapter 13 both have their positives and negatives. Since you stat you want to keep you home, Chapter 13 is preferable because you can get caught up on the arrears and potentially strip the unsecured portion of the 2nd once you have completed the Chapter 13 plan. The real issue is whether any plan that can be created will be realistic and sustainable to the point that the judge will approve your payment schedule. I stronly advise you hire an attorney who is knowledgeable in bankruptcy and can create a plan that is feasible.\n\nIf you qualify for Chapter 7, your biggest concern will be whether the 2nd will agree to a repayment schedule. If so, then eliminating your unsecured credit card debt will be the biggest advantage.\n\nI encourage you to call my office, located in Danville, to arrange a free consultation.\n\nDisclaimer:\nThe comments offered here are not meant at legal advice. No attorney-client relationship is created herein.",
        "I agree with both of my colleagues prior responses. I will add this however. You would be wise to seek competent bankruptcy counsel to represent you.\n\nI discuss these issues on my blog.",
        "Debt settlement with the companies that advertise is generally just a waste of your money, because they generally just tell you to stop paying your accounts, which puts you farther behind and they charge your very high fees for that \"advice.\" Then they contact the creditors to settle, but if the creditor or debt collector sues you in court, these companies will not help you. Sometimes they will tell you to find a lawyer on your own. What a waste. I have a legal guide on Avvo about this being a scam. See link below to that legal guide.\n\nIf you qualify for Chapter 7, you could discharge your debts and then focus on the home loans in a Chapter 13, but I wonder if you will qualify due to your income. The big concern for you is the home, which I assume you want to keep. You could resolve the credit card debt, since you at least have a decent income every month. Have you called them to see what they would accept in settlement?",
        "I don't think any attorney can answer everything you want to ask by just posting a message on Avvo. What I can tell you, however, is that (1) if you have stable income; (2) the value of your home is less than what you owe on the 1st loan; and (3) your amount of unsecured debt does not exceed $360,475; then Chapter 13 with lien stripping is probably 'better' for you than Chapter 7.\n\nWhy? Because \"lien stripping\" is not available in Chapter 7, and you are behind by 22 months on your second loan. So if you file Chapter 7, the lender on the 2nd loan may file a motion for relief from stay, get relief from the automatic stay, then proceed with the foreclosure process.\n\nI personally don't have a high opinion of debt settlement. 'Debt settlement' just places you at the mercy of each creditor, as each creditor makes \"settlement\" demands upon you.\n\nI think trying to explain the means test and project your Chapter 13 monthly plan payment is beyond the scope of the Avvo forums. You will need to consult with an attorney.\n\nGood luck!"

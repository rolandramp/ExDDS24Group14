    "title": "Can a creditor file a motion for relief from automatic stay after the 341 meeting and after the car was already surrendered?",
    "question": "I surrendered my car and added it to the chapter 7 bankruptcy. I attended the 341 meeting with no creditors present. After the fact, Wellsfargo filed a motion for relief from the automatic stay. Do I need to attend the hearing ? I also thought creditors were not allowed to contact you to collect a debt after I filed for bankruptcy.",

        "Since it sounds like you are proceeding pro se, you can and should be notified when a lender seeks relief of stay. The lender is not attempting to get you to pay. They want the court to lift the stay so they can proceed with the sale of the vehicle you surrendered. If they can't sell it for the balance owed, any remainder will be discharged and you won't have to pay it. There is no reason for you to attend the hearing, especially if you do not file any written response to the motion.",
        "This is normal. They simply want to remove the car from your bankruptcy estate so that they can proceed to sell it. They are not trying to collect anything from you.",
        "You misunderstand the law. Participating in your case and filing motions they deem necessary is not unlawful contact. As far as the motion, you did not tell us their stated reasons found in the motion. Did the lender actually take possession of the vehicle?"

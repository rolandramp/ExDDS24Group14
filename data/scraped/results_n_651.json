        "There is no way for any attorney to give you a useful answer to this question, because there are too many unknowns. You need to \"fill in the blanks\" by corresponding with the debt collector and the health insurance carrier.\n\nWhen the debt collector calls, calmly ask for his/her name, the name of his/her employer, and the company's mailing address. Send a letter to the debt collector disputing the debt and requesting \"Debt Validation.\" (Send by USPS Certified Mail, Return Receipt Requested.) Next, write to the insurance company, provide a summary of the events that led to the current circumstances. Ask whether, at the time of the services, the provider was an \"in-network\" provider on your particular insurance plan. Ask for a statement of what claims were made for these services, and what was paid to the provider. Ask for a statement of the deductible and co-pays that applied to this service and this provider.

In most situations the applicable statute of limitations is found in the law of the state where the parties reside at the time the debt is incurred, but there are exceptions. Assume for now that the statute of limitations is not a complete defense to an informal demand that has not resulted in the filing of a lawsuit. You may find it more useful to focus on whether you are being pursued for a claim that was denied by the carrier, and whether the denial of coverage was a correct and fair decision.

        "A mistake doesn't have to be fault producing with not way to recoup. The law recognizes that innocent mistakes happen. If the insurer made a mistake they are probably entitled toget their money back. The statute of limitations for them to sue to recover it is probably 4 years."

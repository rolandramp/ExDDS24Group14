        "I only add here what has not been addressed in your original question.\n1. If you are living separately, your income need not be included in determining whether she will qualify for Ch7.\n2. If she files individually, she will discharge her liability on all dischargeable debts. If your name is also on any of those debts, you would remain responsible; but creditors will not be able to come after you if your name is not on the debt, regardless of the community nature of the debt.\nIf you're trying to work things out, wouldn't it be better to restart with her debt-free?",
        "She can change her mind. Debt relief companies who promise to pay your creditors on your behalf tend to be less effective and more expensive relative to filing bankruptcy. Debt relief companies usually charge a monthly fee and their payment plans tend to drag out costing their customers more money in the end. Creditors can still sue under those debt programs and in fact people come into our office who have tried those debt payment programs but who are now being sued. Then, once a lawsuit is filed the debt relief company says go find a lawyer to defend you and the person is left in the dark.\n\nBankruptcy offers an approach that erases most debt for a very affordable price. Bankruptcy may not even effect her credit score that much if she is already behind on her credit card payments. There is also a common misunderstanding that a person who files bankruptcy loses all of their property, this is simply not true. For many, the bandaid has to come off and it is just less painful if it is done right away.\n\nIf you want to discuss more than I suggest you consult with a bankruptcy attorney yourself to get a better understanding of how bankruptcy works.",
        "I would go back to the attorney your spouse started with and explain the situation. Of course your spouse may change her mind, but now you both need advice from someone who has already analyzed her financial situation, what types of petitions can be filed, and whether it makes sense to try to settle debts.",
        "Yes, she can change her mind at any time before the filing and not file for bankruptcy. You can definitely try to approach the creditors first in order to resolve the debts. This may be successful if you have some financial resources you can tap into to resolve the debts.\n\nJust remember, speaking with the creditors in order to resolve the debt does not stop them from taking steps to collect, such as filing a lawsuit. And, yes, I agree with my colleague, be careful about debt settlement firms who claim to help you resolve your debts. Hope this helps.",
        "I admire you for wanting to \"negotiate\" settlements with your creditors/collection agencies. In my experience, time spent in negotiating is wasted because without a lawyer, you will likely not be able to get any significant balance reductions. I do not recommend that you use any of the so-called \"Debt Settlement\" entities because many are scams only looking for folks like you who are desperate to avoid BK. I have personally heard many clients' stories about unsuccessful efforts with these companies and who wound up paying them thousands of dollars for minimal benefits. Instead, I urge you to discuss your options with an experienced BK lawyer.\n\nBK is more than checking boxes on forms you find online. Find/consult/hire a lawyer using the Avvo feature \"Find a Lawyer\". Make a list of 4-5 having many 5 star reviews from satisfied clients. If you don't get a prompt call back from one, go on to the next on your list. Some of us offer a free consultation by phone or in person. Take us up on it.\n\nBecause the bankruptcy process can be handled entirely by phone, email and fax, there is no need to personally visit the lawyer’s office unless you want to. Don’t be limited by the location of the BK lawyers you select. Good luck and God bless.",
        "Yes, she is allowed to change her mind and not file bankruptcy.\n\nIf she is represented by an attorney, you should involve the attorney in any negotiations you are having with creditors, and you should get the attorney's advice in deciding whether or not to file Ch. 7."

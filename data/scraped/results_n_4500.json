    "title": "Did I commit fraud by filing a \"skeleton\" bankruptcy?",
    "question": "An agency solicited me to apply for refinancing of my home that was being forclosed on and helped me complete the long application process. To postpone the eminent foreclosure in order for the bank to receive my application before it occurred, they told me to file bankruptcy and sent me the forms. I didn't want to, but they said it was just a skelton application, and would not send any more forms and would let it expire in 2(?) weeks. (BTW, I didn't know I would lose a credit card to this action...sob.)",

        "You need to get some good advice go sit down with a bankruptcy attorney to see if they can help you with your financial situation.",
        "Courts will not pursue fraud on a mere filing a skeleton BK. If you do not intend to proceed it is certainly a \"bad faith\" filing. Dealing with non attorneys advising on bankruptcy is almost always a mistake. Contact an attorney to advise on going forward. If you file a \"good faith\" Chapter 13 you are not precluded from proceeding with attempts to refinancing. However few lending institutions will finance when there is a fresh BK.",
        "Technically, you did not commit fraud, but you did file a bankruptcy in \"bad faith\". The long term affect of that probably is none, except to your credit, assuming you don't need a bankruptcy in the near future. But, do not file another bankruptcy after this one is dismissed, even at the urging of this company. Bankruptcy is not intended to just stop a foreclosure without the need to either restructure or discharge your debts and the effects of the filing will stay on your record for 10 years. If you were in the middle of a legitimate modification process and your lender was considering your application, no foreclosure was legally possible. Also, in California it is illegal for any company, or individual including a real estate agent or attorney to take any money from you in advance prior to completing the work on a modification. The only reason I mention that, is that it was NOT good advice to have you file a skeletal filing to stop the foreclosure as there are numerous other ways to accomplish that without such a harsh consequence, so I am suspect about this \"agency\". Make sure you are getting legitimate help and advice! Good luck.",
        "What you did is not good, but the question of fraud is about intent. If you filed a bankruptcy without the intention of going forward with it, you can get in trouble. I suggest you evaluate your finances to see if you want to pursue the bankruptcy now that you are in it. You should also get a full understanding of the refinancing because a bankruptcy judge often has to give permission for you to close on the refinancing."

        "I agree with much that has been said before me. Most debts are Dischargeable in Bankruptcy, even if a default judgment has been entered, but some debts are given special status, like most taxes, student loans, support obligations, and debts that are adjudicated as having been the result of fraud, etc. Bankruptcy attorneys are generally great at making themselves (ourselves) available for no obligation consultations. Pick a couple attorneys in your area and look up online what their clients say about their experience(s) working with their attorney.\n\nDon't wait for the creditors to get into your bank account, to record a property lien, or initiate a wage garnishment.\n\nGood Luck! Get it done!",
        "Any judgment based on non-payment of atty fees, including a default judgments, is dischargeable in a Chapter 7 BK.",
        "As I'm sure you have heard by now, the default judgment is dischargeable AS LONG AS the judgment is not based on fraud, breach of fiduciary duty or embezzlement, or some willful intentional act that caused damages to the party that sued you. If you own real estate, you want to check to be sure the creditor has not obtained an abstract of judgment and recorded a lien against real property.",
        "Call Brian Whitaker's Office. He can take care of this for you. Attempting to do a bankruptcy without the assistance of counsel is not a good idea.",
        "I agree with attorney Whitaker and add this: If you own real estate and a judgment lien has been issued against the property, then the debt could be discharged but the lien would remain and need to be cleared if you ever sell or re-finance the property. See a bankruptcy lawyer for details.",
        "Yes - a judgment is dischargeable in bankruptcy (assuming the debt was not incurred on the basis of fraud or malice and was not deemed a form of support in Family Court). (There are other exceptions that would not apply in your case.)",
        "You need to speak to a bankruptcy attorney in order to obtain a specific answer to your question-------a attorney is your best option to protect you. Use Avvo's Find a Lawyer tab & search for bankrruptcy attorneys in your area. Good luck."

    "title": "Palmer Reifler and Associates. Breaking payment plan. Read whole thing before answering please :)",
    "question": "I received letters from palmer reifler and associates for alleged shoplifting and after they kept harassing me with letters and phone calls I called and made a payment plan with them to pay $885 spread out over 10 months. this month is my first month for a payment and i havent sent anything in yet. I have been reading on this site and it seems that they never sue if you dont pay. what are the chances of them suing me for breaching our agreement by not paying? and if i break our \"contract\" if it even IS a contract (by not paying), can this affect my credit? how likely is it that they sue individuals for \"breaking contracts\"? How likely is it that they will notify and damage my credit? Please help!",

        "The general rule is that overpayments of state benefits are still subject to discharge. So, if the mistake is that of the state or other public entity, and not a result of fraud, the \"debt\" for overpayment of benefits should still be dischargeable (cancelled by the bankruptcy).\n\nPublic entity taxes are more difficult to discharge. But social welfare benefits (unemployment insurance & disability, for example) are not taxes.\n\nGood luck.",
        "I agree with my colleagues, as long as there was not a finding of fraud regarding the overpayment (which there usually isn't) then you can discharge this debt in bankruptcy. I recommend meeting with a couple experienced bankruptcy attorneys to discuss your financial situation and make sure bankruptcy is the right option for you.",
        "As another attorney answered, it comes down to whether there was fraud in procuring the benefits. That is generally not the case. An attorney can go over what makes a debt non-dischargeable and how it would apply.",

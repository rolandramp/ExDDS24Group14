    "title": "I owe 1376 non-fraud overpayment CA EDD UI. Making monthly payments now. Will the state withhold both state/federal tax refund",
    "question": "__",
    "answers": [
        "Call the EDD Benefit Overpayment Collection Section at 800-676-5737 and review any agreement with the EDD because they have the authority to attach your refund.",
        "As I understand your question, you have entered into an installment agreement with the EDD to repay your overpaid unemployment insurance benefits. You need to review the installment agreement and see whether it contains provisions allowing the State to offset your State income tax refunds and/or to request interception of any Federal tax refunds in satisfaction of your UI liability. I suspect that the installment agreement probably does contain such a provision, especially as to a State income tax refund.\n\nIn addition, Internal Revenue Code Sections 6402(c)-(f) allow Federal income tax refunds to be offset against the following types of debts: (1) a debt owed to any Federal agency; (2) debts for past-due child and spousal support payments; (3) past-due, legally enforceable State income tax obligations (see also 31 CFR 285.8); (4) erroneous payment of unemployment compensation due to fraud or failure to report earnings; and (5) failure to make contributions to a State's unemployment fund for which the state has determined the person is liable. Thus, it is quite likely that any Federal or State income tax refunds to which you may otherwise be entitled to receive will be offset against your unpaid UI liability until it has been paid in full.\n\nGood luck!"

    "title": "Credit card I didn't open was charged off for $120 in 2011. Now I'm being sued for $6,000. Is this legal?",
    "question": "I never opened a credit card, but started receiving bills for it. I blew it off. They eventually charged it off. About a year ago I got a letter from a new debt collector saying they now owned the debt and I owed them $4,000. I didn't dispute the debt, again, I just blew them off. I just got served with a lawsuit saying I owe them $6,000. Is there anything I can do? Is this a violation of the Fair Debt Act? Can I sue them back?",

        "Just because the original creditor charges off a debt, that doesn't mean that a debt collector cannot sue on it. They can and they do as you can see. It would depend on whether you have any defenses (it appears that you do). If you did not use the card or if it has been more than 4 years since the debt became sue and payable, etc. .. Talk to a qualified attorney (as you can see, they are available). Good luck to you.",
        "The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and the Rosenthal Act (California's version of the FDCPA) regulate the manner in which debt collectors may attempt to collect a debt. A creditor filing a lawsuit against you because you did not dispute a debt is not, in and of itself, a violation of the debt collection laws. However, there are a variety of other ways a collector may violate these laws. You should consider contacting an attorney who is familiar with these laws to evaluate whether you may have a claim. If you have a claim, it will provide additional leverage in your case.\n\nRegardless of whether the collector violated the FDCPA or Rosenthal Act, it sounds like you may have a defensible case. Be sure to respond to the complaint within the time stated in the summons. Even if you don't pursue an FDCPA or Rosenthal claim, you should contact an attorney to assist you with the litigation.\n\nIf this is a case of identity theft, you should file a police report. Providing proper notice of the identity theft to the collector / creditor may subject the creditor / collector to additional liability if they continue their collection efforts.",
        "From what you say, you have an excellent defense to their lawsuit. As far as bringing a FDCPA lawsuit or cross complaint against them, your case should be \"set up\" with proper correspondence before you file. To do this properly, you should be represented by an attorney who has expertise in these types of cases. The good news is that you may be able to get the court to award attorney's fees, payable by the other side to your lawyer. There are strict time limits involved, so see a lawyer this week, or sooner.",
        "To properly advise you, an attorney needs to see the lawsuit, letters from the debt collector, and the documents you still have from original credit company, You should find a local debt collection attorney and schedule a consultation."

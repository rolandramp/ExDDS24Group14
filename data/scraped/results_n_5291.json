        "Review California Family Code section 910. Debts incurred after physical separation are the separate debts of each spouse, with the exception of some \"necessities of life.\"\n\nDo not pay a penny. That will re-start the Statute of Limitations and revive the debt. As it stands now, they cannot successfully sue you if file an Answer and allege the running of the Statute of Limitations.

        "Since California is a community property state, unless you were legally separated at the time that she received the treatment, you would be liable.",
        "You were not living together, but did you or her intend to eventually get back together or was it completely over at that time?\n\nThere may be some loophole to getting out of that particular debt but it may be a lot of trouble. I'd just take the credit hit."

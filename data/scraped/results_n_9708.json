I am not certain how factually your husband's (if you were married at the time of his death) ex wife could have ownership interest in the house you were living in. You probably should contact an estate lawyer. If there is a a will you will need to bring that with you. If your husband was never divorced from the first wife and there was no will you may be in a serious situation. contact a lawyer right away.\n\nBetsey Herd\nTampa, Florida",

No one can file a partition complaint unless they have some equity claim on the home. Even if the ex does have some equity claim on your home, you still get a credit for what you have paid to maintain the home.

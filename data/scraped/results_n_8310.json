    "title": "Can I file bankruptcy on behalf of my deceased spouse?",
    "question": "My late wife and I owned a house which I had put in her name years ago. She had her own business which generated quite a bit of income, but when she died, so did her business. After her death I was able to get the title of \"our\" house back to my name. Since she died her creditors still keep sending me threatening letters for her bills. I also haven't paid my mortgage in 4 months as I am on disability. Her creditors never got a judgment, but I am worried about losing my house. Can I filed bankruptcy on her behalf even though she passed away?",

        "Only real persons & recognized business entities can file for bankruptcy.\nDebts of a deceased person can be eliminated in probate court, and I would suggest that you contact a probate attorney to see if you need to open up a case to eliminate her debts.\n\nBased on the fact that your house is now in your name alone, I wonder whether there is anything that your late wife's creditors could take if they sued her.\n\nHope this perspective helps!",
        "To be a debtor in bankruptcy you must be a living person. So no you can't file on her behalf.",
        "Only a debtor may file bankruptcy. A debtor must be alive.\n\nCreditors cannot collect from a person who is dead. Her debts died with her. Of course if there is property, and an estate is set up in the Probate or Surrogates's Court, they may file a claim. This advice is unfortunatley limited to NY law only.",

Any property that you owned jointly did not become part of her estate, so her liability is only subject to the assets that became part of her estate. You should speak to an estate attorney or perhaps a bankruptcy attorney for yourself, because changing the Deed (if it was in her name only) may have been a mistake and may mean that the house is part of her estate.\n\nREQUEST: Please give this answer a \"thumbs up\"(below) if you find it valuable.\n\nDisclaimer: This answer does not constitute legal advice.

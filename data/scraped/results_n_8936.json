    "title": "Is this the Civil Demand Letter? Came directly from Nordstrom?",
    "question": "I was caught shoplifting at Nordstrom about a couple weeks ago. Items totaled to be roughly $85, but no police were contacted. I gave my info (DL, SSN, address, photo) to Nordstrom, and they said they would keep it with the store only.",

        "They can but I have yet to see either a store or law firm follow through with the threat to file a civil lawsuit, probably because the filing fee would be close to, or more than the demand itself. Seems like an overwhelming consensus amongst the attorneys on Avvo agree that no response is probably the best way to approach this situation. Good luck.\nPLEASE NOTE THAT THE FOREGOING IS OPINION ONLY AND NOT LEGAL ADVICE NOR DOES IT CREATE AN ATTORNEY-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP.",
        "There's nothing that prevents a store from cutting out the middle man.\n\nThe law firms that send out civil demand letters work on commission, taking a percentage of what they take. Since they're just paper-pushers who don't really so anything that requires an attorney, the merchant has apparently decided to cut them out of the action.\n\nBottom line: ignore them. The letter sounds like it's full of the same \"weasel words\" a law firm would include. For instance, they say they \"may commence civil legal action\" instead of coming out and saying \"pay up or we'll sue.\" That's because it's a violation of Federal debt collection laws to threaten to sue if they don't really intend to follow through.\n\nI've written a legal guide with more detail.

It's impossible to give detailed, accurate advice based on a few sentences on a website (and you shouldn't provide too much specific information about your legal matter on a public forum like this, anyway). You should always seek advice from an attorney licensed in your jurisdiction who can give you an informed opinion after reviewing all of the relevant information."

        "Depending on the amount of equity and your available hometead exemption, that could be true. If you have equity over and above the alloted homestead amount, the Chapter 7 Trustee could sell your home. You would receive the first distribution of the applicable homestead exemption to which you are entitled, i.e., $75,000, $100,000 or $175,000. Consider Chapter 13. Look into a Reverse Mortgage. Negotiate a payment plan with the judgment creditor.",
        "In order to properly analyze your situation it is important to know among other things how much equity, whether you are married and/or have dependent children living in the home with you, your age, your income, and any other assets you may own. While Chapter 7 may or may not be an option, a competent lawyer should at least explain more than “only option is lose house.” He/She should be able to provide information so that you clearly understand potential solutions and/or potential risks. If all you were told was that your only option is to lose house get a second opinion.",
        "A chapter 13 bankruptcy may allow you to find a way to become current on the loan."

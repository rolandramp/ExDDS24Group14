    "title": "Will the Franchise Tax Board pursue an owner of an LLC for unpaid $800 annual fee?",
    "question": "What will happen to the owner of an LLC that failed to pay the Annual $800 LLC franchise tax for the last 10yrs? The LLC never conducted any business and has been sitting active all this time. We received a letter asking us to file taxes and pay an annual franchise fee for the last 10yrs, which is an INSANE amount of money, especially since we never conducted ANY business. Are they allowed to collect from me personally?. Will Filling the past due taxes make me responsible to pay the annual franchise fee? (I'm asking this because it would be a pass-through entity). I've read elsewhere on this forum that another individual was going through something similar and was advised to walk away and ignore all correspondence.",

        "The FTB has not been taking court action to pierce the shield of limited liability and collect these tax debts against the beneficial owners of interests in LLCs. That doesn't mean that they won't take such action in the future. Some attorneys believe that the probability of the FTB taking you to court over this is very low. Other attorneys don't want their clients to be the test case for any litigation. If your LLC's only tax liabilities have been the $800 franchise fee, then it is probably even more unlikely that the FTB would take you to court to collect the balance owed."

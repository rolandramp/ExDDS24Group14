        "A process server would not ordinarily call before attempting service ... if you know they're coming you may try to avoid them. Also, they may be bluffing ... so you can advise your fiance to wait to be served. If he is served, he will have to decide whether to defend the lawsuit on the basis of ex's fraud or pay it and attempt to recover from the ex or file BK. If BK (and you have considerable debt yourself) you may want to get that wedding out of the way so you can file jointly.",
        "Sometimes. But they don't have too.",
        "I don't know what a processor is, but I am guessing that you are referring to a process server who delivers legal papers from the court. Typically, private & law enforcement process servers do not call unless they have not been able to find you at home. You will want to receive the legal papers, because if you hide from this information, the creditor can use other methods to proceed with the lawsuit without requiring you to have actual notice of it, and you will have no one to blame but yourself. Hope this perspective helps!"

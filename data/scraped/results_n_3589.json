    "question": "My contractor with a L.L.C. filed for bankruptcy in 3/18 which I did not know about. On 3/19, he asked for second stage of payment. I paid him in cash but I kept the receipt. They obviously filed for bankruptcy as a scheme to avoid completing my contract. Will I be able to sue him and get the second stage payment back? The contract was signed on December, 2013",

        "The proper course of action for you depends a lot on which chapter of bankruptcy was filed and whether the debtor has indicated in its paperwork that it intends to assume (or honor) its agreement with you. In any case, you need to file a claim in the bankruptcy case and then consult an attorney.",
        "Were you listed as a creditor in the contractor's BK? It might be possible for you to get back your money by filing an adversary complaint in the BK for fraud. If you can prove the contractor took your money knowing he was not intending to complete your contract work, the BK judge can order him to repay you. Consult with an experienced creditors rights/BK lawyer now. This is not a DIY project.",
        "A bankruptcy only wipes out debts that were incurred before the bankruptcy was filed. Since your payment of March 19th was a day after the bankruptcy was filed you should be able to sue to get your 2nd payment back. Whether you will be successful in collecting from him is another problem you will have to face."

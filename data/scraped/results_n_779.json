    "question": "my brother has been on the title of my parents house for the past 20 years. About 5 years ago my brother filed for bankruptcy Ch. 7. He disclosed my parents property on the schedule D as the property secured by debtors mother' residence. In 2015 our mother passed and my dad was diagnosed with dementia. Immediately there after, my brother claimed full ownership of the property. An elder financial abuse case is established and evidence presented show he reported the property as my parents at his bankruptcy hearing in 2015. It appears his attempt to avoid the Elder Abuse claim, he is going to Amend the discharged Ch. 7 to now report the property as his own. What is the scenario for him if he does attempt to amend the bankruptcy after five years since being discharged? Will the DOJ see it as perjury? He",

        "I can tell you that this kind of thing happens with some degree of frequency. Someone will omit an asset from their bankruptcy case, appear to have \"gotten away\" with not disclosing it, and then come back to amend. If your brother so much as hinted that his name was on the title to the property in his bankruptcy schedules, the fact that upon the death and disability of your parents he has now become a full owner, he may have fully complied with the requirements of bankruptcy law and amending is a mere formality. The fact that you claim that he disclosed \"my parents property on the schedule D\" suggests that he did attempt to claim this ownership at the time he filed bankruptcy, although real estate goes on Schedule A, and a mortgage debt would go on Schedule D. Hope this perspective helps!",
        "The one core fact is missing from your description. Was your brother the only person on title 5 years ago when he filed, or was dad, mom, and brother (and whomever else). It sounds like he disclosed the existence of the asset. You mention Schedule D (which is secured debts), but debt listed on schedule D should match up to an asset listed on Schedule A or B. So, it sounds like the existence of the asset was disclosed, but your brother either intentionally or negligently misrepresented the nature of his interest. The thing is, with real estate, there needs to be a paper trail to establish ownership. You can't just \"claim\" to own real estate, there needs to be documentation. In any event, a bankruptcy attorney would look at whether there would have been any affect on your brothers bankruptcy if he were to make the change. If the answer is no, then no one will care. For example, even if your brother was the sole owner of the home at the time he filed BK, if the property would not have been liquidated, then it is a case of no harm, no foul. If the home would have been liquidated to pay creditors, then if your brother amends the bankruptcy, that will likely be what happens, and all that happens. Again, it sounds like the existence of the asset was disclosed, so it could have been investigated at the time, so I doubt the US Trustee/DOJ would get involved. The bankruptcy trustee would just proceed with selling the property.",
        "Maybe. The case will be reopened and the trustee reappointed. The trustee will look into whether the asset should be administered ( sold for the benefit of his creditors) and will also look into why the asset was not properly listed when the case was filed. The trustee or the UST might refer the case to the US ATTORNEY if they determine the debtor was trying to hide assets. You need to discuss this with your attorney for the elder financial abuse case and with a local bankruptcy attorney."

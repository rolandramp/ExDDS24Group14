    "title": "Regarding Statement of Intention-Chapter 7-Do I need to amend it if I am no longer reaffirming a car loan?",
    "question": "Originally, I filed the Statement of Intention stating I was going to reaffirm a car loan. The loan company said I didn't need to reaffirm as long as the payments were being made. If I don't amend the Statement, will the Court set a reaffirmation hearing automatically? Or is there a time limit and if no reaffirmation agreement is signed does the court not set a hearing? I am in the Central District without an attorney.",
    "answers": [
        "No need to amend. A reaffirmation agreement must be filed with the court before discharge. If that doesn't happen, that is the end of it.",
        "No - you do not need to amend ... and the court will not set a hearing based solely on your Statement of Intention.",
        "If you can continue making the car payments w/o a reaffirmation, that is what you should do. Since you don't have a lawyer, the court would have to approve the reaffirmation agreement. You don't need to do anything re amending your Statement of Intentions.",
        "No need to amend. A hearing is only set if the reaffirmation agreement (or specifically a motion requesting approval of the agreement) is filed with the court. Generally the reaffirmation agreement is only filed with the court if you signed it. It would need to be filed while the case is open.",
        "Generally, the statement of intention does not affect the reaffirmation agreement. If you do not have an attorney and a reaffirmation agreement is filed, the court should set it for a hearing you will have to attend. Even if the reaffirmation agreement is approved by the court, you may be able to rescind your election if you have a change of heart. You should also discuss with a lawyer an option to \"redeem\" the loan, especially if the vehicle is worth less than the loan amount. On this issue, you need an attorney consultation.\n\nGenerally, the reaffirmation agreement is voluntary on your part. The advantages of signing it are: positive credit reporting if you pay on time, and possibly a new or renewed credit account. The disadvantages of signing it are: you will still owe the debt and if you default, they can harass you, sue you, and otherwise collect the debt despite the bankruptcy being filed.\n\nPlease note, under certain circumstances you may choose to not sign this reaffirmation agreement and you may be able to still keep the car as long as you pay on time and have the required insurance.\n\nPLEASE BE AWARE THAT THE 2005 BANKRUPTCY CODE CHANGES MAY ALLOW THE FINANCE COMPANY TO REPOSSESS THE VEHICLE IF YOU DO NOT TIMELY SIGN AND RETURN THE REAFFIRMATION AGREEMENT EVEN IF YOU ARE CURRENT ON PAYMENTS AND INSURANCE.\nTHEREFORE, GENERALLY SPEAKING, I DO RECOMMEND SIGNING THE REAFFIRMATION AGREEMENT IF YOU ARE CURRENT, IF YOU WANT TO KEEP YOUR VEHICLE AND IF YOU BELIEVE YOU CAN AFFORD TO MAKE THE REST OF THE PAYMENTS.\n\nHowever, on this issue you should speak with a qualified bankruptcy attorney before deciding what to do."

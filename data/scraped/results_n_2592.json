        "I respectfully disagree with my colleagues. The writ of execution has a finite \"life\" of 180 days. However, each bank account levy must be requested by the creditor and a fee must be paid to the sheriff to re-deliver the writ to the bank. Whatever is in your bank account on the date the sheriff re-delivers the writ is what the bank is required to pay to the sheriff. For example, if the sheriff delivers the writ to the bank on January 5 and you have $50 in the account, that is what the sheriff gets. If you deposit $10,000 on January 6, the bank pays nothing to the sheriff. This works differently for a wage garnishment. In the event the sheriff delivers the writ to your employer, up to 25% of your net wages can be withheld each payday. One delivery, many withholdings. To sum up, no new funds are \"scooped up\" from your bank account as a result of one writ delivery by the sheriff. A Chapter 7 BK filed within 90 days of a bank levy permits you to recover amounts levied from you for any amounts if you can exempt them when you file the BK. BK is not a DIY project and you should find/consult/hire an Avvo lawyer by clicking on the tab \"Find a Lawyer\". Many of us give free consultations. Hope this clarified your situation.",

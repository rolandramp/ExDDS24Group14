    "title": "Can a U.S debt collection agency collect personal, foreign debt from another country?",
    "question": "If someone acquired personal debt such as study financial aid abroad and now has received a letter from a US debt collection agency to pay it and if the person has no means to pay it, due to unemployment, can the agency try to collect and are they able to do so here in the US? Is their claim to collect even valid, since the debt was not acquired here in the first place? Is it even legal? Do they have a case? Can they bring me to court?",

    "answers": [
        "They can file a civil lawsuit against you, either here or in the foreign country. If they sue you here, they may need to bring witnesses to court if the case goes to trial.",
        "Yes, they can still attempt to collect the debt from you. Be sure to protect yourself by consulting with either an experienced debt collection attorney or bankruptcy attorney. There are specific requirements debt collectors have to meet at the state and federal level when attempting to collect debt from you. In my opinion, to best protect yourself and asset your rights as a consumer, you should consult with an experienced debt collection or bankruptcy attorney.",
        "Yes, a debt collector or the creditor can file a debt collection lawsuit against a person for unpaid debts, whether incurred in this country or abroad. If the individual is unemployed, they can still get an enforceable money judgment, which lasts for 10 years, but can be renewed again and again. Consult a debt collection defense attorney who handles student loans to explore your options and see if this student loan may be dischargeable in bankruptcy or if you have valid defenses.

        "Without conducting a meaningful review of your specific situation, it is impossible to determine with any degree of reliability what (if any) property the Chapter 7 trustee will likely liquidate in your case. Having said that, to the extent that you have equity in any property that you are unable to exempt, you are right to be concerned that the Chapter 7 trustee may liquidate that property in order to make funds available for distribution to your creditors. Indeed, this is the primary function of the Chapter 7 trustee.\n\nOne possible option that you may want to discuss with a bankruptcy attorney in your area is converting to a Chapter 13 (because property is not liquidated in a Chapter 13). Determining whether this is a realistic option for you, however, will require a close and careful review of your pending Chapter 7 case and your current financial situation.\n\nAs for your final question regarding the consequences of “stopping” your bankruptcy proceeding, you should know that a debtor in a Chapter 7 case does not have an absolute right to voluntarily dismiss his or her case. Although a Chapter 7 debtor may file a motion to dismiss, in my experience bankruptcy courts are often very reluctant (if not completely unwilling) to dismiss a Chapter 7 case when it is evident that assets will be available for liquidation and funds will be available for distribution to creditors. In other words, if you ask the bankruptcy court to dismiss your case because you now realize that the Chapter 7 trustee may liquidate some of your property, I believe it is highly unlikely that the court would grant your request.\n\nAgain, I strongly suggest that you consult with a bankruptcy attorney in your area, if you have not already done so. I wish you the best of luck.\n\nPlease note: this answer does not constitute legal advice, and should not be relied on, since each situation is fact specific, and it is impossible to evaluate a legal problem without a comprehensive consultation and review of all the facts and documents at issue. This answer does not create an attorney-client relationship."

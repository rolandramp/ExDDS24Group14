        "The short answer is yes. Even if you file alone, his income is counted for the \"means test\" (statement of \"current monthly income.) It is also considered when they look at the actual income on the \"I\" and\"J\" schedules. You will need to give the Trustee 6 months of bank statements and 6 months of pay stubs for both of you. This is also an issue because, absent a \"prenuptual\" premarital agreement his income is community property.

The National Association of Chapter 13 Trustees had an article on their website a few years ago.

    "title": "What are standard exit guidelines for partner leaving an C Corp with debt and not worth much?",
    "question": "10 year company. Myself and partner in a C Corp. Company has aprox $80K in debt. Business has been on a decline the past 2 years and at this point is not worth anything on paper. I have decided to move on but my partner wants to keep the business so clearly it has value to her. I would like to just walk away, give her everything, future sales, brand ect. and the debt.",

        "Your focus on who pays or keeps the debt is misplaced. As a C Corp, neither you or the other shareholder are personally liable for the corporation's debts, unless you personally guaranteed the corporation's debts. So, if you want to be bought out or withdraw as a shareholder, there is no reason you should have to assume any portion of the debt. This does not mean that the debt is not a consideration when determining what you may be paid for your shares.\n\nI would agree with my colleague that there is no \"standard\" exit model and that each business situation is different. However, your questions point the way to a reasonable model that should be attractive to the remaining shareholder: she (or the corporation) buys your shares for a price, a portion of which is tied to future sales/profits (which is sometimes called an \"earn out\"). A portion of the purchase price should be paid at closing, with the remainder (including the earn out portion) paid in installments over a period of time.\n\nBy paying in installments, the remaining shareholder leverages the business and earns the money to pay off the debt and pay for your shares. The corporate debt can be one component in determining how the earn out is calculated - i.e., your percentage is applied on the gross profits less operating expenses and payments (and interest) on the debt. So the earn out feature canbe used to provide the remaining shareholder with the time and capital to turn the business around (by defering payment to you and allowing her to focus on paying down the debt). Additionally, the earn out allows he to \"reduce\" her payments if she cannot grow the business, but allows you to share in the profits if she is successful. So both sides benefit.\n\nHowever, there are other issues that you should address beyond the compensation and debt issues. These issues can be complex since you must comply with the requirements of several statutes. For example if you agree to an installment payment plan, then you should have some collateral security or other recourse in case of non-payment or default. There are different methods of \"perfecting\" (or securing your rights in) your security interests, depending on what collateral you use. You should also have some auditing rights (to make sure your earn out payments are accurate). An experienced business lawyer should be able to provide you with various alternatives, alert you to the risks and help you decide what structure is reasonable and fair for both of you.\n\nThis answer is intended for informational purposes only and does not constitute legal advice.

        "Mr. Shultz is right, you need to get a lawyer to have your co-owner buy out your shares of this corporation. In addition to having the corporation keep the debt (and the assets), it's not unreasonable for some of the future profit pay off your share of the debt. You should also be concerned about ending any liability on your part as a result oo the continued opertion, as well as a release from the corporation and your co-owner for claims up to the point of buyout. This can be achieved, but you'll most likely need a business lawyer to help you.\n\nDisclaimer: Please note that this answer does not constitute legal advice, and should not be relied on, since each state has different laws, each situation is fact specific, and it is impossible to evaluate a legal problem without a comprehensive consultation and review of all the facts and documents at issue.

(I appreciate of course, that if money is tight, it may be difficult to pay for a lawyer.)\n\nThird, there is no \"standard\" exit model. Each business situation is different.

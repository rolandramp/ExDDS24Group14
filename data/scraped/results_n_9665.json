    "question": "My granmother is survived by 2 children, one of whom is residing in the house now and paying property taxes, utilities, etc. Do we have to go to probate? Will the 2 children have to sell and split the property?",

        "If the house is worth less than $100,000 you can use a special \"small estates\" procedure. Otherwise, if you try to sell the house or get refinancing you're going to run into trouble - the title company will want proof that the house belongs to the 2 kids, and the only way to get that proof is to go through probate.\n\nJust because the house is probated does not mean that it \"must\" be sold, unless there are creditors' claims and no other money or assets to use to pay them. If the 2 children are \"friendly\", they can agree to keep the property.\n\nIf you don't probate the house and get things straightened out, you might end up not being eligible for the \"parent-child\" property tax reassessment exclusion.\n\nI suggest you get this taken care of. If you need assistance, I'd be glad to help.",
        "I agree with the previous answer that you should probably talk to a qualified attorney. There are small estate procedures for real estate under $100,000.\n\nAlso you didn't state how title to the home was held. You need to ascertain how the title was held by your grandmother first. Its possible it was already held as joint tenancy in which case all you would need is an affidavit from the surviving joint tenant and a certified copy of the death certificate to be recorded.\n\nIt is generally a lot easier to take care of things now when there is no pressing concern rather than when you are in a hurry to sell a house or take out money against it.\n\nI can't tell you how many times I have had clients and potential clients come in where someone hasn't taken care of title after someone passed away and then it becomes an obstacle to selling etc.\n\nI agree that you want to claim the parent child exclusion for property 13 purposes to lock it in.\n\nI also agree that there is no reason why the house would have to be sold unless the children don't get along ( i.e. can't agree to both be on title as tenants in common) and your grandma didn't leave unpaid debts."

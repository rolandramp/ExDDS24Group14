    "question": "Cosigned on a car for granddaughter. We paid it off and hold title. Both names are on the title and we want to have our named removed. She's not paying the insurance, we are, so we can cover ourselves, in case of an accident. She's refusing to sign the title, so only her name is on it. What now??? Help!!!",
    "answers": [
        "You say \"Both names are on the title \"-- then \"only her name is on it. \". Did you mean so only her name WOULD be on it?\n\nIf titnel is in \"or\"and\" you can change it, but in the meantime, (and if now) insure the car.",
        "It depends on how your name is on the title. If it is an \"and\" then you will need her to sign the title. If it is an \"or\", you can sign the title and transfer it."

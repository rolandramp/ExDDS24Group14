    "title": "Can I stop a garnishment from Dept of education?",
    "question": "I called collection agency for Dept of education because I defaulted on a student loan for my son many years ago. I called 2weeks ago to make Pmt arrangements & meanwhile mistakenly signed a studen forgiveness loan scam & hired an attorney to help me cancel the scam contract. In the meantime, I was sent a garnishment notice from Dept of education last week with 30-day notice from date on letter (Jan 11). I didn’t see any 30-days notice, but i only received it a week before I called collection agency. No date on envelope, so I couldn’t prove that I just received it. So I called again last Monday to make Pmt arrangements & they said I was too late, my 30-days expired 2 days before and there’s nothing I can do about it. This was extremely upsetting since I’m trying to build my credit right now. I’ve called this collection agency every day since Monday & some people give me some hope to stop garnishment if I send some financial info & Pmt & others say it can’t be stopped no matter what. If I pay $10,000 by 90 days, it can be stopped. I don’t have that much money though. I know the IRS isn’t this harsh & they are also a government agency. It is not sent to my employer yet. Any advice?",

        "Garnishment does not require a 30 day notice. Once the garnishment hits, you have 10 days to show that you need money to live on. As far as any other way of dealing with student loans, the news is not good. They cannot be discharged in bankruptcy.\n\nPrivate loans may or may not be willing to negotiate with you. Federal loans can possibly end up in a program that allows you to repay part of the debt under certain circumstances. It’s quite complicated I knew all need at least some help figuring it out."

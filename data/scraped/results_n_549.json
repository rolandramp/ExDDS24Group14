    "answers": [
        "As stated by my colleagues, support money cannot be discharged in BK. Being homeless suggests you have little or no income. We don't have debtor's prison here for almost 300 years so don't worry about that. If you do have income above a certain level, you could be held in contempt of court for not obeying the judge's order. Talk with a family law specialist for the best advice. Good luck and God bless.",
        "You can't get rid of child support in a chapter 7 but you may be able to get rid of your other debts. I suggest that you take advantage of a free consult from a bankruptcy attorney in your area.",
        "You can file Chapter 7 bankruptcy and discharge all your other debt; but the child support arrears are not dischargeable in bankruptcy. Another option is to file Chapter 13 bankruptcy and pay what you can afford to pay for the next 3 - 5 yrs (assuming the arrears have been assigned to a governmental unit for reasons other than voluntarily simply for collection) ... you will still owe the remaining unpaid arrears, but your situation may have changed by then."

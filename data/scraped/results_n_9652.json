    "title": "Are VA disablity benefits exempt in bankruptcy, do I have to state them?",
    "question": "I was origanally rated 30% and just got an increase to 60%. I have had SO much trouble trying to work, and I live in CA, I have had to live off credit at times and I am maxed out. I owe $20,000. These are my debts alone, my wife is now active duty and I will be moving with her soon, but I only have currently 376 a month, and I have another back surgery planned. I have had perfect credit all my life but now I can no longer even afford the min payments. This will be the first month I miss any payments, but I can not afford this and I can not rely on my wife to make my payments, that is too much to ask she is only a E-1",

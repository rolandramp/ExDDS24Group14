    "question": "In 2015 i needed to go the emergency room and did not have any medical insurance. Later on I was billed 20,000 dollars. Revenue and Recovery handled the debt and I signed a document at the time being the age I was i did not understand it. I entered into a payment plan. I had paid 600 dollars of it and then fell into financial situation and got behind on payments. 5 days ago I was served with papers and now am getting sued.",

        "Your post raises more questions than answers. When you say the age that you were, does that mean you’re under 18? If so, that makes a difference.\n\nI find the idea of an emergency room visit cost and $20,000 to be obscene. I think that from your perspective filing bankruptcy without your husband makes a lot of sense. Sadly, the hospital will pass their loss along to others, but they shouldn’t be charging that kind of money for emergency room visits.\n\nIf you find out on your own it will not affect your husband’s credit, so that’s probably your best bet. I would talk to a bankruptcy attorney immediately."

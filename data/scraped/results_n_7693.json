    "title": "How do I keep my apartment lease in Chapter 7?",
    "question": "I just filed under Chapter 7 and I am confused about my apartment lease, which has 8 months left to it. I am current with my rent and I desire to continue living in the apartment. Where on the Statement of Intentions do I put it, under \"debts secured by real property\" or \"personal property subject to unexpired leases\"? Neither seems accurate (I am using the SOI form provided by the court) but there is no section for executory contracts or real property leases.",
    "answers": [
        "Not only do I list it on Schedule G and check “assume” as the intention, but I also exclude it from the Creditor's Mailing Matrix.\n\nThis way you avoid tipping off your landlord about the bankruptcy. Why would they need to know? It's not affecting them as you are current with rent and intend to stay that way.",
        "Leases are not covered under the Statement of Intention. You need to describe the lease on Schedule G and if you want to keep it in good standing, you will indicate that you are \"assuming\" or \"assume\" the lease.",
        "Since you have already filed Chapter 7 and you now appear to be filing out the Voluntary Petition, I recommend you speak to a qualified bankruptcy attorney. Leases are listed in Schedule G. Apartment leases are generally not reaffirmed.\n\nAs long as you pay the payment is doubtful the landlord will make an issue or choose to incur unnecessary fees to make it an issue in your bankruptcy.",
        "If you are current on the lease and wish to remain there, you do not have to list it. However, you do list the amount of your rent on item one schedule J.\n\nI hope this answers your question."

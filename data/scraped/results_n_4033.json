    "title": "A car dealer ran my credit through 10 different banks causing a drop in my credit score. Can they do this? What can I do now?",
    "question": "I have been working to improve my credit for the past 2 years after having a 420 credit score. I have managed to resolve a lot of old debts and get my credit score to a 600. Now it may not be the greatest, but I have worked hard for it. I needed a new car, and went to a dealership who asked me if they could pull my credit report. I agreed, but we did not close the deal because I felt the asking price was too high. I decided to wait and research my financing options. I decided to check my credit report again only to find that the dealership ran my credit through 10 different banks and my credit score went down, and that the inquiries will be on my credit for more then a year! Is this legal? Can I file a complaint? What recourse do I have?",
    "answers": [
        "I am guessing there is something else that dropped your score, such as a new home address or a missed payment.",
        "I agree with my fellow colleagues here. Best bet is probably to dispute with each of the bureaus reporting. Seek the assistance of a credit repair specialist if you feel this is too much to handle.",
        "I believe there is some provision that treats all inquiries within a short time span as only one inquiry. Look at the Fair Credit Reporting Act, or talk to a local attorney familiar with it, since there are often similar state laws as well.",
        "Fair Isaac, the developer of the FICO credit score, uses a 14 day window for their de-duplication. Any inquiries that can be reasonably assumed to be from a car loan or mortgage application that occur in a 14 day window are treated as one inquiry in their scoring models. It doesn't matter if you have 20 inquires. As long as they are from lenders who can grant auto or home loans AND they are all done in a 14 day period they only count as one. In fact, this logic is in the process of being expanded to count the same multiple inquiries occurring within a 45 day period as 1 inquiry.\n\nNow this system does not always work perfectly, so you can write to the credit bureaus and ARGUE that the 10 inquiries SHOULD count as only one."

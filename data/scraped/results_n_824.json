        "The issue is not the debt being cleared off \"your credit report.\" Rather, the issue is whether your obligation to pay the debt is, in bankruptcy terms, \"discharged.\" If a debt is discharged, then the credit report must accurately reflect that fact.\n\nSo if your question then is whether your student loans will be discharged in a bankruptcy case, the answer (as the other lawyers have said) is \"probably not.\" It is very difficult to discharge student loans in a bankruptcy case. You have to show 1) that if forced to repay, you wouldn't be able to maintain a minimally adequate standard of living, 2) that there are additional circumstances indicating this sate of affairs is likely to continue, and 3) that you have made good faith efforts to repay in the past. Very few people meet this standard, and usually #2 is the sticking point.\n\nBut if your question is \"will bankruptcy help,\" the answer is \"maybe.\" For example, if you are being garnished and the lender won't agree to a reasonable repayment plan (if they're private loans), or if you don't qualify for income-driven repayment (if they're federal), you might be able to use a Chapter 13 case to force what is essentially a 5-year forbearance on them.\n\nSo all in all, you need to talk to a lawyer. Your situation is unique, and a lawyer would need more facts about your specific situation to help you figure out if & how the Bankruptcy Court can help. Does it cost? It will not be free, but a lawyer will lay out what would be accomplished and what the fees would be, and you can make the decision if it makes sense for you.",

Rausa in San Diego is one of the best. Contact him by phone. You won't be disappointed. Good luck with solving your financial problem.",
        "If these are federal loans, there are several programs to resolve these student loans, including income based repayment programs that could be as low as $0/month. But you can't get these deals without applying for them. Yeah, it will cost several hundred bucks to get into these programs if you in default on these loans. Bankruptcy probably the worst way to sove this kind of debt problem. Hope this perspective helps!",
        "Debts do not get 'cleared off' your credit report, they stay on your report and the debt is listed as 'discharged in bankruptcy' and fall off as they age.

This is done by filing a complaint inside the bankruptcy, or after the bankruptcy is discharged.

Private student loans become zombie debt if you don't make a payment for 4 years and the creditor fails to sue you. If the creditor sues you you may use any defenses you have and work out a settlement.

    "title": "Chapter 7 bankruptcy. If we bank w/ BofA and have credit cards with them, can they freeze or attack our account b4 we file?",
    "question": "My question is, since we are not paying on the credit cards with BofA and are planning to file bankruptcy next month, will they be able to freeze our account or otherwise attack it?",
    "answers": [
        "If you owe money to BofA, they can take funds out of your account to off set those amounts. This usually does include credit card debt, amounts not owed directly to the bank. Talk to a local bankruptcy attorney to see if your local area is different.",
        "Many BOA deposit accounts are subject to a provision called \"set off.\" This provision makes your checking or savings account a form of collateral against any debt you have with the bank and allows the bank to take your deposit account to pay any delinquent debt. Why take the risk when there are many other financial institutions competing for your business? Hope this perspective helps!",
        "The other attorneys are correct. I always advise my clients to stop banking with their creditors prior to filing bankruptcy.",
        "I alway recommend moving accounts from banks to whom you owe money to other banks before you file for just this reason.",
        "Typically, only credit unions act in this regard, but some banks have also been known to do this.\nHighly recommend that you open up a new checking account at a different financial institution. Then move all your cash to this new account, including any direct deposits you may have. Keep the BofA account open; do not close it! Keep a small amount of cash in it, typically $100 or less. Do not give them any heads up that you are going to BK.\n\nAfter you file your BK, you may still bank with them. They cannot discriminate against you, other than raising your interest rates and lowering your credit limit.\n\nAs the other attorney mentioned, this is a minefield. Recommend you retain competent legal counsel in your area before you wade out in the open.\n\nBest of luck!",
        "B of A can offset any amounts you owe them against deposits on account with them. If you're filing the bankruptcy on your own, there are a LOT of bear traps waiting for you. I strongly suggest you have an attorney represent you."

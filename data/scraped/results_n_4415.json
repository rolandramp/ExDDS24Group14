    "question": "A sole beneficiary of an irrevocable trust dies. The trustee lives in California. I have been told that if the assets are distributed to the remainder beneficiary and California taxes are owed that the remainder beneficiary could be liable for these taxes. The beneficiary could still be liable for CA taxes owed even if the beneficiary doesn't live in California. Is this true?",

        "I agree with the answer and recommendations given to you by Attorney Givner.\n\nYes, the beneficiary may be liable for CA income taxes on income generated by a trust. California has no inheritance tax to worry about, whether on the death of the settlor or an income beneficiary.\n\nOften the amount of CA tax on the income is relatively small when compared to the total amount distributed. Also, the amount available for distribution is usually greater if the income is taxable to the beneficiary.\n\nA beneficiary has income tax liability on the income portion of the distribution to that beneficiary. As a general rule, this is better because the individual is usually in a lower tax bracket and pays lower tax then the trust would have if it had been taxed on that income. The federal and state income tax brackets rise faster and get to the maximum tax rate much faster then for individuals.\n\nIf the income was taxable to the trust, but the trustee didn't pay it before making distributing it to the beneficiary, the beneficiary would have transferee liability to pay the tax up to the amount of the distribution. Of course, if the trustee had already paid the tax, the amount assets distributed would have already been reduced.\n\nTrust income may end up being taxable in more than one state depending on the circumstances. Usually there is a credit or adjustment that remedies this situation. However, some states don't take this into account and taxes are paid to both states on the same income. The tax effect of where a trustee lives is often over looked when determining who to name as trustee of trust.",

        "First, the issue is how the trust is taxed. There are three ways in which an irrevocable trust can be taxed: as a grantor trust, which is disregarded for income tax purposes, and the grantor (creator - trustor - settlor) is taxed directly on the trust's income, deductions, gains and losses; as a complex trust, in which the trust is taxed on its income, deductions, gains and losses - however, it gets a distribution deduction to the extent that it makes distributions to the beneficiaries; and as a simple trust, in which it is required to distribute all income to the beneficiaries, in which case the trust pays no taxes. So we need to know, by looking at the trust instrument, how the trust is taxed before we can answer your question.\n\nSecond, if the trust is a complex trust the beneficiary could still be liable for tax if the trust has California source income even if the beneficiary is not a California resident.\n\nSo, unfortunately, you need to hire a competent tax lawyer to determine the answer on your facts.",
        "In the simplest terms, tax liens follow distributed trust property. Such liens are enforceable against beneficiaries. A trustee must settle all outstanding tax debts before finally distributing trust property."

    "title": "Had a chapter 7 discharged but accidentally missed a creditor. Told to write a \"Beezley\" letter to the creditor. Need template.",
    "question": "Basically I read that there was a case called Beazley that states the debt is discharged anyway as I was a no asset case and it was an unintentional ommission. Can anyone please help me locate a sample letter that I could use to send that to the creditor? I just don't have any $ right now so I need to handle this on my own. Thank you SO much!",

        "\"Dear (Creditor): Please find attached a copy of my Discharge in a no-asset Chapter 7 Bankruptcy case. Apparently, your debt was overlooked and not included. Under the case of In re Beezley (1993) 994 F.2d 1433 (9th Cir) your debt is discharged notwithstanding my failure to schedule your debt. Please do not attempt any collection efforts on this account as you will be in violation of the discharge injunction. Sincerely, _______\"\n\nSend the letter by certified mail, return receipt requested.",
        "Stuart's template is perfect. I think I will replace mine and start using it myself. Thank you, Stuart.",
        "You can call and just give them your case number and date filed! If a collection company especially, that is what they need to know! If you do that usually that will suffice. Its free to call and immediate. Then write down who you spoke to and when. Then if you ever receive another communication advise them of who you already spoke to and when.\n\nAfter 45 days after your discharge, order all of your credit reports also then and object to all dischargeable debts as all should state \"zero balance, discharged in bankruptcy\" including the debt you are referring to as missed. Then object to any untrue information on your credit reports per the directions on them! Now, you can spend a couple bucks or send the information on letter to the creditor as indicated by the perfect answer by Attorney Stuart too! But a call in most cases will probably work! Have a great weekend too.",
        "e all seem to have a similar Beezlley template. Beezley was reaffirmed by the Ninth Circuit in White v Nielsen (In re Nielsen) (9th Cir 2004) 383 F3d 922.. You can throw that in as well. Good luck.",
        "Stewart's verbage is perfect. In fact it sounds like he's reading my own Beazley template.",
        "There is nothing special about the letter you send. I would make is super simple. Send them a copy of your Discharge with a cover letter stating that their debt has been discharged. That is it."

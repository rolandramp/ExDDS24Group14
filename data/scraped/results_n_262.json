    "title": "Can we use most of the PPP loan as a regular loan (no forgiveness) to pay for business debt?",
    "question": "My business is non-essential. I have plans to reopen but not sure when. My 8 employees (part time + full time) are all on EDD and even if I reopen, they don't want to come back because they get more with EDD right now. I received my PPP loan 2 weeks ago and not sure how to use it without my business not being able to open or fully open and I only have 8 weeks to use it! I have credit card debt for my inventory on 16% interest so I was wondering if I can pay that off using the PPP loan and just treat it as a regular loan, paying the 1% interest. I don't need to be forgiven for the loan, so I'm thinking the 75/25 doesn't apply? Any information would be helpful, thank you!",

        "Yes, your good.\n\nYou may still be able to get a portion of it forgiven. While the SBA forgiveness rules seem to evolve frequently and there is a potential that congress may make further statutory changes to the Cares Act, currently you can get up to 25% of the loan forgiven on certain non-payroll business expenses like rent and interest. It may be worth some investigation to see if you can save some money on expenses you are paying anyway.",
        "Yes - you can.\nThe PPP loan is just that - a regular loan.\nHowever, the amount that you spend on wages and rent/lease payments (with limitations) within 8 wks will be forgiven (if you properly apply for forgiveness) ... and you will only have to pay back the rest."

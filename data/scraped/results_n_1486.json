    "title": "Secured credit card company didn't refund my security deposit after I filed Ch. 13 in 2013. Atty claims they ignore him.",
    "question": "Ch 13 plan is 5 yrs. I called the credit card co & their agents read policy \"deposit refunded when bankruptcy discharged\" but what possible interest does co have to hold deposit for Ch 13 term?? Is this legal or an outrageous act? Plus, my atty claims they ignored his request to speak with someone -- I believe he is not diligently advocating my interests and merely called one time.",

        "As long as the collateral is less than the amount owed, I would normally have put this claim in the class of claims in which the collateral would be surrendered. The balance of the claim would be treated as unsecured. This keeps the plan payment down.\n\nOtherwise, if you treat this claim as secured and pay the creditor the value of the security, they will have to turn over the amount of the deposit, but not until you have paid them. In that situation, you are paying them the same amount, plus interest just to get your money back without interest. I don't see any reason to have a plan in which you would just be \"buying back\" your deposit and paying interest on it.\n\nSo I would think the first option is the best.\n\nThere is not enough detail in your question to know what you plan says about this creditor, whether the creditor has filed a Proof of Claim, etc., so I can't really tell you what is happening in your case or whether it is \"normal\" under the circumstances. Ask your attorney for more detail, for a description of how this claim gets treated and what happens to your deposit.",
        "Welcome to the world of the \"offset\". As atty Gambrell correctly states, the deposit you made to obtain the credit card is considered \"collateral\" placing your credit card debt in a different category. A secured creditor has a right to look to the collateral for payment of its debt. After your 13 completes full payment to the credit card holder, you may be able to request a refund, provided your attorney exempted the deposit as an asset in your case.",
        "The security deposit is collateral for the amount that you have borrowed on the card. Example: If you owe $750.00 and the security deposit is $1,000.00, all you would be entitled to receive would be the $250.00 equity. The U.S. Supreme Court, in a case called Maryland v. Strumpf, upheld a creditor's right to place an administrative hold funds that the creditor held on the petition date, which is the date the bankruptcy petition is filed, as a set off.\n\nIf the amount you owe to the credit card bank is $750.00 and the deposit is $500.00, the bank can hold the entire amount."

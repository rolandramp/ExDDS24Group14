    "title": "How will a bankruptcy affect my ability to rent housing during college relocation",
    "question": "I'm planning on moving to San Diego from California to finish my education. I filed for bankruptcy several years ago and am working to rebuild myself. I read they cannot discriminate, but are there any programs that could help or documentations I can bring.",
    "answers": [
        "If your credit and current income stream are good, you should not have any problem. The bankruptcy was years ago.\n\nGOOD LUCK!!",
        "You are asking a question about something that has not even happened yet. The best thing to do when you get to San Diego is to find a place, fill out an application and see what happens. Typically landlords are looking at prior evictions, not prior bankruptcies.",
        "You mentioned your bankruptcy was filed several years ago. If you improved your credit score in the years following your bankruptcy, you may appear more favorable to some landlords; however, the landlords still have a right to deny you housing on account of your bankruptcy filing.",
        "Every one has given sound advice that being said my clients have found searching for a unit with a smaller \"mom and pop\" landlord has proven more successful and being upfront about the Bankruptcy filing and a letter explaining why this had to happen and where you are now financially. Also if you have or can get references from former landlords this may help a lot! Good luck.",
        "Prior submitted responses have provided you with good responses. Even though the bankruptcy on your credit may cause some issues for renting, talk with the landlord to see if options may be available, for example, a larger security deposit. Also, you may have been able to obtain new credit since the bankruptcy - that might show the landlord that you are recovering from that situation. A co-signer on the rental agreement may also be an option.",
        "This would be the same as saying landlords cannot discriminate because of your low credit score.",
        "I agree with atty Colwell. Your BK can be considered by LL as a negative factor. The more time between your BK and new housing the better.",
        "You say you have read that they (landlords) cannot discriminate (due to BK filing). I don't believe this is correct. I believe they can refuse a rental/tenancy due to a BK filing having been reported/disclosed/discovered. Having said that, all of our prior clients are finding some place to rent, but the search is more difficult, as some of the larger rental management companies have a blanket, no rent, policy where a BK is indicated. This is not universal, however. In your case, I'd think that the passage of time, and hopefully a past history of 'successful' tenancy/rentals on your record, will assist you in finding a suitable place to rent. JCC"

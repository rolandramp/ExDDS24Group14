        "No one asked the key question - Did the court approve the reaffirmation agreement? If so, then I agree with them. If not, then the debt was discharged and no further personal liability exists. Around here, judges do not typically approve these agreements except under limited circumstances. Check with your bankruptcy lawyer or the court to determine the status of the agreement or talk to your bankruptcy lawyer.",
        "This is a bad situation without many solutions.\n\nThere is no court action or reconsideration.

        "I agree with my colleagues. This is an unfortunate situation. Perhaps you will not be laid off and everything will turn out. Otherwise, you may want to contact the creditor to see if they are willing to work with you. Explain the situation and see if they can adjust your payments for a while. If the car gets repossessed the unfortunate thing is that you will owe the difference between what they sell it for and what you owe. Since creditors often get minimal value for cars at auction you might get stuck with a large bill...one that you can't easily get rid of now that you just filed a 7 a few years ago. Good luck.\n\nAlon Nager\n410-575-3917\nalon@russacklaw.com\nDisclaimer: Please note that this answer does not constitute legal advice, and should not be relied on, since each state has different laws, each situation is fact specific, and it is impossible to evaluate a legal problem without a comprehensive consultation and review of all the facts and documents at issue.

        "unfortunately, that is exactly why we (attorneys) do not like those things. I do not sign off and let clients keep upside down cars for the exact reason you're in now. Best thing to do now is look for a second job to carry you in case the current one goes south... or see if you can sell it and pay off the difference... otherwise you'll end up with a repo and find difficulty in securing financing in the future.",
        "No. A validly filed reaffirmation agreement may only be rescinded up to 60 days after the agreement is filed with the court, or whenever your discharge is entered, whichever is later. Your fact scenario is the very reason most bankruptcy counsel refuse to sign off on reaffirmation agreements or advise their clients to do so."

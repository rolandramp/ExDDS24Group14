    "question": "I am considering filing Chapter 13. I make over $100K/year. B22C says my DMI is $2,500/mo. My Schedule J shows net monthly income (income less expenses) of $1,000/mo. My total debt plus Trustee's fees = approx. $40k. Is my monthly payment going to be $1000 per monthh (per I and J), or $667 ($40k divided by 60)?",

        "In chapter 13 bankruptcy, some interest may be added if the bankruptcy debtor has \"too much\" money left over, though never assume that's the case-- where one stands in relation to the bright line median is a starting point for determining disposable income in chapter 13 bankruptcy. Ultimately the bankruptcy petitioner cannot pay more than what it takes to sufficiently pay off his debt, that is to say until the powers that be dedicate a charitable fund allocation to benefit abused, underprivileged and disadvantaged multi-billion-dollar-profiting-conglomerate creditors, you cannot pay more than what you owe.",
        "The rule is still, the debtor must devote all disposable income to the plan. So, you will pay the higher monthly amount if that is what the means test and Schedule I&J show. If you were in my district, odds are, if your B22C says $2,500 and I&J says $1,000, there better be a good reason, or your payment will fall between $1,000 and $2,500.",
        "It'll start out at whatever your attorney proposes ... what happens after that will be up to the Trustee.\nWhile your Applicable Commitment Period will be 5 yrs, your actual plan will terminate when you've paid all the claims filed. The longer you propose to take to pay 100%, the more likely your Trustee will want a little extra going to the creditors.",
        "When you are proposing a 100% plan, trustees tend to be a lot more flexible when recommending confirmation of a plan. I have a client, for example, that showed a $1400 surplus on Schedule J and we proposed a 100% plan with a $1000 payment. The trustee wanted my client to add a small interest factor of 3% and my client agreed. Plan confirmed and my client was happy that he didn't have to out the full $1400.\n\nIn your case, you have to factor in unpaid legal fees and the trustee's commission. The trustee's commission could be as high as 10%, so paying of $40K in debt might require paying in 44K into the plan, so your payment would probably be at least $733. Whether the trustee assigned to your case would accept less than $1000 per month would be a question to ask of a BK attorney in your area. if you were in San Diego, i would say you probably could do that.",
        "There are some circumstance where everything is not determined by B22 see the Laning case - but unless something really different is going on there - it is determined by B22. Since you make way above median income assuming its just a household of one - it is going to be a 100% plan."

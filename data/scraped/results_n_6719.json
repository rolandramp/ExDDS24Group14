        "You can fill out and mail to the levying officer a Claim of Exemption (WG-006) with attached Financial Statement (WG-007). The levying officer will then send copies to the judgment creditor.\n\nIf the judgment creditor does not oppose the claim within a certain number of days, the levying officer will adjust the wage garnishment to the amount you want deducted. If the judgment creditor opposes the claim and sets the matter for court hearing, the judge will decide the amount deducted. Although the judgment creditor is not required to appear at the hearing, you must appear.",
        "You can file an exemption claim, triggering a hearing on the garnishment. The forms are here -\n\nClaim an exemption:\n\nhttp://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/wg006.pdf\n\nFinancial worksheet:\n\nhttp://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/wg007.pdf\n\nIf the creditor shows up to contest the hearing, you will have to prove that you will be unable to meet very basic living standards if the garnishment is sent through as required. There is no guarantee that you'll prove this since, just because YOU feel you'll be unable to afford a 25% cut in your income, that isn't the standard the court uses."

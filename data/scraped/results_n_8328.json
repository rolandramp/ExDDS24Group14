        "Your responsibilty for this car loan should be discharged in your chapter 7 so long as you don't sign what's called a \"Reaffirmation Agreement.\" If the car's not badly damaged, you may want to discuss \"retain & pay\" options with your attorney which, depending on your lender, could allow you to keep the car as long as it's convenient for you and then turn it back in later with no further financial responsibility.\n\nAs a side note, you mentioned being in an accident. If there's any possibility that you could be liable for damages to any 3rd party, other drivers, your passengers, etc., you should list them as potential creditors in your bankruptcy filing.\n\nGood luck!",
        "I agree with the answers above, and add only that on your statement of intention you list the vehicle as being surrendered. Your attorney will work with the auto lender to have the vehicle repossessed, and after the vehicle is sold or otherwise disposed of and the proceeds applied to your account, your account deficiency will be discharged as unsecured through your bankruptcy. Just make sure the debt is listed. I wish you the best of luck! Disclaimer - This is not intended to be legal advice, nor should it be construed as such. An attorney-client relationship is only formed when a retainer agreement is signed.",
        "I see this situation come up from time to time & haven't had any problems with it. Just list all your assets and all your debts. Unless you were cited for driving under the influence, the debt car loan should be discharged with your other debts. Unfortunately, when a debt is connected to driving under the influence, the situation completely changes and you may not be able to obtain a discharge.\n\nHope this provides a fresh perspective.",
        "Yes. That debt is dischargeable and must be listed in the bankruptcy."

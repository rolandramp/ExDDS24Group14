    "title": "Can we collect on a small claims judgment of about $6,000 after the defendant filed bankruptcy?",
    "question": "We were awarded a small claims monetary award judgment of $5,675 including court costs in November of last year. In January we filed an order for examination of assets since we had not heard anything from the defendant. From that point we had our next hearing May and because of COVID it was moved to July for a hearing. Between January and now the defendant filed bankruptcy on our judgment. Our questions are:",

        "If the debt is dischargeable in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy (not all obligations are), filing for bankruptcy will wipe out your (the creditor's) ability to collect. Judgments, however, create a lien on property. Liens don’t go away in bankruptcy automatically.\n\nWhen a lien attaches to property, you will get paid out of the sales proceeds when you sell the home. The debtor can file a motion to avoid the lien in a bankruptcy case, and in many instances, the debtor can successfully remove it. The debtor must file the motion—filing a bankruptcy alone will not get rid of it—and it doesn’t work in every situation.\n\nIt’s advisable to seek the advice of a knowledgeable bankruptcy attorney.",
        "My colleagues are right. You cannot collect your judgment and by failing to inform the Civil court of the BK, you are actually in violation of 11 USC §562 which specifically requires a halt to all collection efforts. A bench warrant is part of the collection effort. You better cross your fingers that the debtor's attorney is asleep. You could be facing a motion for monetary sanctions.",
        "As stated, you cannot collect on the debt. If a bench warrant was issued, the defendant should have informed the Court of the bankruptcy. Only the Court can vacate the Bench Warrant. Yes, you should have been forthright with the Court regarding the bk, and yes, you could find yourself in front of a bankruptcy judge if a violation of the stay motion was filed. When was the bk filed? Has it been discharged yet?",
        "Unless the judgment was for fraud or injuries due to driving under the influence, you are pretty much out of luck. You could file an objection to the bankruptcy on those grounds, but the time frame for doing so may have passed and the grounds for an objection are very narrow. Also, the legal fees would be more than the judgment amount."

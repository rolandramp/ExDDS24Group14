    "title": "I have a question about a debt collection law suit placed against me",
    "question": "I recently noticed a charge and closed debt owed from a company called Persolve LLC, on my credit report. I called the number to inquire about it, and they told me that I was being sued for an amount owed from 2007, which I remember closing. They insisted that they filed a law suit, by sending a process server to my home, who then served the papers to an unknown person to me. I doubt they even visited my home, and then they proceeded to take the suit to court. Which they claim is now as a charge against me that will stay on my credit report for the next ten years, or until I pay the amount owed; which they were trying to get me to do in order for me to get that taken off my account.",

        "Persolve is a debt buyer. It buys portfolios of delinquent account from creditors, including credit card companies. It appears that they obtained a default judgment against you. The judgment is a public record and may be reported on your credit report. I doubt that you will be able to get Persolve to drop the matter. And, even if you pay them the full amount (including interest), they cannot change a public record. What you need to do is to review the court file at the courthouse and get copies of the relevant documents, including the Proof of Service form, which states the date, time and place of the purported service of process. If the proof of service is not correct, you need to retain an attorney and have the attorney file a motion to vacate the default judgment and allow you to defend the lawsuit in court. You may also have a basis for suing the creditor and/or the collector for violations of the federal and California Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. In many cases, if you win, you can collect attorney's fees from the other side.",

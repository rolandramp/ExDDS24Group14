        "You must see an experienced attorney for many reasons. For example what if an attorney says you can exempt so much under CA law and then you learn NO..you cannot because you did not live in CA more than 2 years before you filed? If that happened to you you can understand why it is not just simple. OTher facts and issues can affect your case.\n\nSome persons, if they would lose most of a settlement, might settle, take the money, by a small home, etc. or put in places to try and maximize exemptions before the file at some point in the future. Thus find a CA attorney now..there are great ones on here.\n\nYou need and want to enjoy your fresh start also. But the most important thing is to meet with an attorney as you asking this question means you have not. You care about 2 goals: keeping everything you have equity in and discharging all your debts. If you don't have any of the exceptions to discharge you will obtain that goal; most exceptions are set forth in 11 USC. 523 (Google it) like child support, some income taxes, traffic (in a ch 7) and criminal fines , and presumption of student loans. But some debts are dischargeable in a ch 13 but NOT in a ch 7 so you want to make sure and your attorney will discuss any such types with you also!\n\nYour exemptions depend on what state you have lived in in the last 2 years and thus if in your state, then your states exemptions will apply. Most persons filing keep everything they own but your attorney will confirm that with you when they learn everything you own and the equity thereof!\n\nSome secured debts like homes, vehicles, other secured debts an attorney will discuss your options on also as you must list any debts; but that does not mean you will lose them unless you have too much equity or are in default on paying for them! Discuss those options if they apply with your attorney too.\n\nBut other issues can arise that can greatly harm your case. Just one example: If you paid back a relative $3,000 11 months ago and now file bankruptcy next week, the trustee can SUE that relative to retrieve that $3,000 (under what is called a preference) for the benefit of the bankruptcy estate. As a result, most attorneys don't charge to meet with them the first meeting so meet with one no matter what.\n\nMany great attorneys can be found right here on AVVO in your state so look, call, and meet one as soon as you can.\n\nYou should also want to know when to file: is there an advantage of waiting versus filing now and who should you pay between now and then! Good luck and enjoy your later fresh start.",
        "You really NEED to speak with an experienced bankruptcy attorney. If you file prior to settling the PI case, the trustee could assume control of that claim and use all the settlement to benefit your creditors and you might not see a penny. Of course, this depends on what California law allows to be exempted and an experienced California attorney can discuss that with you.",

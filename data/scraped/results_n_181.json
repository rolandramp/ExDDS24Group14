    "title": "How long is too long to enforce a judgment in California?",
    "question": "I won two judgements back in March of 2019...1.5 years ago. The dollar amount for both judgments is approximately $5,000. The lawyer that helped me win the judgments has made up tons of excuses as to why he has yet to file a lien and pursue the judgments. He is very difficult to get ahold of and I would just like to put this to an end. I am also concerned that there is a finite amount of time to collect these judgments. What should I do? I now live outside of California so I can't just go to the courthouse and figure it out for myself.",

        "By colleagues have given your good legal and practical advice, to which I add the following: You should hire an experienced, aggressive debt collection attorney to take the case on a contingency basis. That means, he will deduct his fees from whatever he collects. If he collects nothing, you owe nothing. A win-win situation. You may have to advance a small amount for the costs to record your judgment. If your debtor owns any real estate, it is almost malpractice for a lawyer not to take some steps after getting a judgment for you.\n\nFind/consult/hire a lawyer using the Avvo feature \"Find a Lawyer\".

        "You may want to try contacting legal aid and the county bar association in the county your judgment is located and see if they have a lawyer who would be interested in collecting your judgment. Those lawyers are usually low cost or work pro bono. If the amount of your judgment is still only $5,000 then it be worth it to go this route.\n\nBest of luck!",
        "Your judgements are good for ten years, and then you can renew the judgment. On the plus side judgments accrue interest at 10% per year. So in ten years the judgment is worth twice as much.\nDoes your judgment provide for attorney fees?",
        "You have ten years from the date of entry of judgment, and if you apply to renew before the ten years is up, you will normally be granted another ten years. Your judgment is earning 10% simple interest per year.\n\nUnless attorney fees to collect can be added to the judgment, it is possible that a collection agency could be a better fit. However, depending on the reasonable likelihood of actual collection (the judgment debtor's assets, income, etc.), one probably should not hold one's breath.\n\nBankruptcy filings are expected to increase in the coming months and years, and your judgment could easily become a discharged debt. Even if the judgment debtor owns a home, the homestead exemption goes up to a number between $300,000 and $600,000 beginning Jan. 1, 2021, depending on the median sale price for the county where the home is located. Your $5,000 judgments would be competing against deeds of trusts and possibly tax liens, and a forced sale would not usually leave any money behind after those other senior liens were satisfied.",
        "Your problem is that it is probably not worth the lawyer's time to follow up. Your best bet may be to turn the judgment over to a collection agency."

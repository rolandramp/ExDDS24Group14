    "question": "I have Divorce case and I am prepering my Preliminary Declaration of Disclosure. If I am eligibile to use FL-155 (Simplified Form) is there a reason why I should still chose to fill FL-150? Instructions on FL-155 states Even if you are eligible to use this form, you may choose instead to use the Income and Expense Declaration (form FL-150).",

        "The purpose of doing this is to insure that you have fully disclosed all of your information to the other party. If a simplified form does not give you the space or give you the opportunity to do this, then by all means you need to use the FL-150. In reality, the FL-150 is not that difficult to do but, again, the basic principle here when it comes to the PDD, is to fully disclose all debts, assets and liabilities. If you can't do this using the FL-155, then you will probably be better off using the FL-150. The penalty for non-disclosure is severe, err on the side of giving the other side much more information than they would anticipate getting.",
        "Well, you want your disclosures to be as complete and accurate as possible. Do what works best under your circumstances."

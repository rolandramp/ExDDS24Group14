    "question": "Back in 2003 I purchased a loveseat and sofa from McMahans Furn. and paid the amount owed in full. Thinking the account was closed I didn't bother retaining any pymt receipts. Then recently I received paperwork in the mail stating I owed $2700.00 and my wages would be garnished. I never received anything regarding a court date so I was never able to defend myself. I spoke to the lawyer handling the case and he basically said there's nothing I could do because the judgments already been made. I know I don't owe this money and there was a mistake made somwhere. Is there anything I can do?",
    "answers": [
        "If you did not make a timely claim of exemption after receiving notice of the wage garnishment, you may not be able to stop the levy, unless you are able to have the judgment vacated and writ of execution recalled by the court. You would still have to defend the civil action on the merits if you are able to have the judgment vacated. Since McMahan's Furniture has closed, the debt is probably being enforced by an assignee who may not have sufficient evidence to meet its burden of proof on the merits of the action. Unfortunately, the cost of retaining an attorney to prepare a motion to vacate the judgment and recall the writ and, if the motion is granted, to defend the civil action on the merits will likely exceed the principal amount of the judgment. In these circumstances, you may wish to pursue a strategy of attempting to negotiate a settlement of the debt. You should consult with a local attorney to discuss the particulars of your matter and for any specific legal advice."

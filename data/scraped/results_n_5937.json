    "title": "Why is it taking so long for my Bankruptcy to get started and I paid all my money and filed all the papers required.",
    "question": "Me and my husband are filing chapter 7. My husband chose a company in Costa Mesa Ca. We have paid for the bankruptcy and given them all the papers required. It has been one month and a half and no one letting us know whats going on with our case. We been call every other day and all we get is a run around and stall time. The name of this company is Morgan Drexen Inc in Costa Mesa CA. My husband seen a commercial on Tv regarding their service. I'm very frustrated because we have giving them our money in trust that they would help assist us in filing our BK. I'm begin to think we have been scam. I have been told by other lawyers that it dont take that long to file once you have paid and all your paper work has been received. Something just dont seem right. What should we do?",

        "It appears that you didn't hire a bankruptcy attorney to represent you. You may wish to contact the office of the United States Trustee, which investigates bankruptcy petition preparing companies to make sure that the fees they charge are within the allowed amount and that they provide honest services to their customers.

        "Here is what BBB has to say about them. They have 253 complaints:\n\nComplainants allege unfulfilled contracts, and inability to obtain refunds when services are not performed. Some customers complain that although monthly deductions are automatically withdrawn from their bank accounts, their debts remain unsettled, and their creditors continue to contact them. Other complainants allege calls to the company to check the status of their case result in the run around, or that the company fails to provide disclosures on where their funds are being held. In some cases, complainants report they have not been given an actual contract, but instead the company uses a recorded message that outlines the terms of the agreement. A few customers complain they receive repeated solicitation calls from the company in violation of the \"Do Not Call\" law. Most complainants request refunds. The company responds to some complaints by advising the complainant that they do not provide debt settlement services to consumers or contract with consumers for such service. The company claims they provide support services to law firms, one of which this consumer may have engaged. In some cases they respond by advising the complainant that the third party attorney has authorized them to make settlement offers. In a few cases the company agreed to issue refunds or partial refunds, or to remove customers names from their calling lists. Some complaints are unresolved meaning the company failed to properly address the complaint allegations or their response was inadequate.\n\nYou have been scammed. Sorry. It is a shame that these companies take peoples money often Thousands of dollars more than it costs to hire a competent bankruptcy lawyer.\n\nI would suggest that you find a lawyer that is (1) a CA State Bar Certified Bankruptcy Law Specialist {You want one in the Eastern District of California - Your nearest may be in Sacramento - Confirm that the attorney does handle cases in Modesto} (2) a member of the National Association of Consumer Bankruptcy Attorneys {they are an association of attorneys who practice representing consumers and not creditors} (3) also look at the Avvo rating. {I suggest that you look for one that holds a Superb rating which is 9.0 or better.}\n\nMost attorneys give a fee consultation. If you do not know who your attorney is than you don't have one. If the \"law firm\" has you do an initial consultation with anyone other than an actual attorney, run the other direction. You can check the California State Bar Association attorney search to find out if it is a real attorney.\n\nAlso ask how long the consultation with the attorney is. If they say less than an hour, it is just a sales pitch. Look for an attorney that will spend at least an hour or more with you.",
        "Hire an attorney. If it doesn't smell right, its not right. Contact the U.S. Attorney if you end up getting swindled for your money.",
        "My colleague Mr. Fenn is correct. Morgan Drexen is a debt settlement company, not a law firm. I would contact a local bankruptcy attorney and see about getting your money back.",
        "From what I've heard from other attorneys in the community, Morgan Drexen doesn't have the best reputation. To my knowledge, it is not a law firm, but rather a company that may or may not use attorneys to handle legal matters. Better Business Bureau rates them an 'F.'\n\nDepending on the complexity of your case, it can take a few weeks to prepare a case properly, but the fact that you can never reach anyone and are being ignored is unacceptable. If you are unhappy with the service, you should be able to demand the return of any unused fees. If you have a contract with Morgan Drexen, you should review it carefully to see what your options are at this point.\n\nIf you want personal service, a large \"bankruptcy mill\" is not your best bet. You deserve better."

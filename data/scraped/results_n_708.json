    "title": "My ex lien sold a motorcycle that was being financed in my name. Can this be included in a bankruptcy?",
    "question": "My ex lien sold a motorcycle that was being financed in my name. He never made one payment and instead traded the vehicle for a debt he had incurred with said individual who now has a lien hold on the bike. He also put me over $30,000 in debt when he would steal my credit cards without my knowledge. I reluctantly decided to file bankruptcy. I still owe on the motorcycle as only 1 payment was ever made. It is actually in repossession status right now. What will happen with the bike once I file bankruptcy? Will it be added into my debts or am I still liable for the remaining $13,000?",

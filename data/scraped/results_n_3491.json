    "title": "Can I request the mortgage trustee to reconvey my mortgage loan due to unsecured discharge in a Chapter 7 Bankruptcy?",
    "question": "I filed Chapter 7 BK in 2013 and received full discharge of my debts in July 2013. I listed my mortgage as unsecured debt, and provided proof to the trustee, based on the fact that I challenged the ownership of my securitized mortgage with a \"validation of debt\" and the lender never provided adequate proof that they were the true beneficiary. The BK Trustee did challenge my claim of unsecured lien at the 341b hearing but decided to let the judge hear my argument. Their was NO CHALLENGE to my unsecured debt or BK by the lender and the judge granted my BK discharge of the mortgage debt. I declined the bank's offer to reaffirm. Since it was listed as unsecured debt AND discharged, can I now request the mortgage trustee to reconvey the now \"unsecured lien\" back to me.",

        "Your actions as described in the question were not legally deficient to wipe out the security interest the lender has on the property. While you may have listed them on the unsecured creditor schedule and they did not object has no consequence. While you released your personal liability to pay on the mortgage by filing for bankruptcy and obtaining a discharge, the lien on the property would still exist. You can't buy anything from the Trustee to get a free home.",
        "The reporting of debt classifications on a bankruptcy filing as secured, priority and unsecured is purely an administrative and statistical function. It lacks any substantive effect & \"too slick\" is usually not a strategy that many judges look on with much favor. You would have always discharged the debt, bu unless you have a court order removing the mortgage lien, the lien still sticks to the property. Hope this perspective helps!",
        "I believe due process would require ANYONE trying to remove a secured voluntary debt to serve a summons and complaint, in bankruptcy called and adversary case, upon the creditor setting forth as any lawsuit the fact and the law upon which relief is sought. Period. Without that, I don't personally believe you will ever remove a secured debt.\n\nNothing happen at that 341 meeting that affect that decision. Nothing.\n\nI suggest if you are trying to remove a secured debt and IF you care, such as living in a house and want the debt avoided somehow, speak to an experienced bankruptcy attorney where you live as it greatly appears you are misguided in the law and facts both of your case on the effect of what has transpired. Good luck. The fact it was discharged has no bearing on the security of the interest itself either by the way.",

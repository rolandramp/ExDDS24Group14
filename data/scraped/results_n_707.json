    "title": "Can an auto loan institution with a judgement against me to garnish my wages, also garnish my tax return from the IRS?",
    "question": "I defaulted on an auto loan that I co-signed, and the company pursued a lawsuit against me. I did not response to the lawsuit since I make minimum wage and have to small children dependent on me, and have no other income. I assumed incorrectly, that since I had no extra disposable income that no judgement would be rendered. But a judgement was issued by the court to garnish my wages. I want to file my tax return in which I estimate to get at least $5000 refund. Can the judgement allow the company to garnish my tax return refund also? I also have significant credit card debt so I was thinking about filing for bankruptcy. Should I file for bankruptcy before I file my tax return or is it ok to wait for the refund?",

        "You are in a tough spot and have a lot of things going on. As the other attorneys have suggested, you tax refund cannot be intercepted directly by the judgment creditor. It can, however, be offset if you owe the government for back taxes or other Federal debt. The wage garnishment will place a significant undue burden on you if it goes into effect. May I suggest you gather up all your bills, and the judgment and income information and set an appointment with a local San Diego Bankruptcy Attorney to discuss options. Most attorneys offer a free consultation. Good Luck.",
        "It is highly unlikely that the judgment could affect your refund ...\nIf you file BK now, you will stop the wage garnishment immediately - and you probably have enough exemptions to exempt your anticipated refund.",
        "You may challenge the wage garnishment outside of bankruptcy, if you can show that court that you are not financially able to pay the wage garnishment and support your dependents and yourself at a minimal standard of living then the Court will stop the wage garnishment until your income increases.\nYou may also file bankruptcy and discharge the debt, along with your other unsecured non priority debts.\nYou may use exemptions to keep your tax refund if you file your bankruptcy first. You may need your refund to pay your attorney and court filing fee so you would want to file your tax returns ASAP.\nYou should seek a consultation with a qualified bankruptcy attorney in your area.",

        "Once judgment is rendered against you, creditor has right to pursue collections. Collection efforts range from Wage Garnishment, Bank Levy, and can include intercepting your tax refunds. You may want to consider filing a bankruptcy proceeding. Consult with a bankruptcy attorney in your area. If you own no real property, you may be entitled to utilize the \"wild card\" exemption, which would protect your tax refund. During the interim, consider filing a \"Claim of Exemption\" and \"Financial Statement\" in order to be held exempt from a wage garnishment."

        "A Mandatory Settlement Conference (MSC) takes place before trial, giving both sides an opportunity to settle the case. Both parties and their attorneys must attend (hence \"mandatory\"), and\n\nYes, you do need to prepare documents for the MSC. You will also need to file them with the court and serve them on the opposing side. These documents generally include a brief that states the issues, as well as up-to-date financial documents (e.g., Income and Expense Declaration, Schedule of Assets and Debts). For exact requirements as to the documents and the deadlines for filing/serving, check your local court rules. They should be available online.

Mediation is a voluntary, informal dispute resolution process to resolve all, or part of, your case. Mediation may allow the parties to avoid the costs, time, and stress associated with formal court proceedings.\n\nYou may benefit from consulting a local family law attorney who can assist you with your case and protect your interests. Good luck!",
        "What actually happens really depends on the county court and each individual judge. You however, better prepare an MSC brief (you can use later to prepare your trial brief) update your Income and expense declaration, file the final declaration of disclosure.",
        "In an MSC, both parties and their counsel (if any) sit down with a judicial officer to try and settle the issues at dispute in the marriage. It is mandatory in that both parties must attend. You need to prepare an MSC brief stating all issues, probably a joint statement of disputed issues which states which issues need to be resolved, an updated Income and Expense Declaration, a Preliminary and possible a Final Declaration of Disclosure. A mediation is voluntary in family law and is not conducted by a judicial officer. Yes you must file all documents no later than 5 court days prior to the hearing and they must also be served on the opposing party/attorney no later than 5 court days.",
        "An MSC is a mandatory appearance in court to attempt to settle a case. It is the last step before trial. You should have an MSC brief and current financial documents at the hearing. Mediation generally refers to trying to resolve custody. This is to try to resolve all issues."

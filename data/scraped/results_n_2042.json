        "Once a judgment is entered, the SOL no longer applies and a judgment has a life of its own, and often can be renewed so often that it might as well be a Vampire. Since the full faith and credit clause of the US constitution requires that every state respect the judgments of sister states, I fear arguing California law as to a Jersey judgment will be futile, but you never know. Hope this perspective helps!",
        "If there was a judgment entered against you, why didn't you go to court? Were you served with a Summons? If you were served and failed to go to court, the judgment is valid and can be renewed. If you were not properly served, and if you did not know that a judgment was entered, you might be able to ask the court -- in New Jersey -- to set aside the judgment and give you your day in court. That motion would need to be made pursuant to New Jersey law, in the New Jersey court.\n\nIf the creditor seeks to \"domesticate\" the New Jersey judgment in California, you may have grounds to oppose domestication. You should have a lawyer carefully review the case.\n\nDo not believe anythnig that a debt collector tells you, especially if it is legal advise.",
        "If this has been turned into a judgment, it's renewable. The NJ creditor can domesticate it into California, at which time it's valid for ten years, and renewable every ten years thereafter. I suggest you contact a debt attorney who can analyze this to be sure it's valid, and/or negotiate on your behalf.",
        "It seems this debt would be well past any SOL in any state. You may want to talk to an attorney who does FDCPA work, They get paid under that statute, not from your pocket,"

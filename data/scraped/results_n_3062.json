    "title": "Lobel Financial keeps garnishing my wages for a car they repossessed 12 years ago. This is their 3 time and they are getting 25%",
    "question": "There was a huge class action suit brought against them in which they were forced to pay millions of dollars back to former customers for doing exactly what they did to me. I am a single mom with two kids in college. We are barely scraping by as it is. How can I stop this unscrupulous business from repeatedly coming after me? They took the car with less than 6 payments left. The first time they garnished my wages they did not respond to my exemption request. The second time a \"judge\" determined that I could pay $25 a pay check but after a few years I received a notice saying the garnishment was stopped as it had expired. This third time I haven't taken any action as I just received it in the mail yesterday. It states they are going to start taking the money on 09/17/4.",

        "Soun. Yourds like you have been penny wise & pound foolish in dealing with this matter without an attorney to represent you. It would have helped if you mentioned how much money remains to be paid on this court judgment. Wage garnishment & modest payments do not typically get you very far to satisfy a large court judgment as all the money paid goes for administrative expenses & interest that has accrued. Make an offer to pay a lump sum or consider bankruptcy. The other choice is to deal with the same old same old, and haven't you been an ostrich long enough? Hope this perspective helps!",

        "Since they have a judgment against you for the deficiency balance, either you went to trial and lost or they obtained a stipulated or default judgment. They have been enforcing this judgment from your wages and can also levy your bank account.\n\nOnly after you have fully satisfied the judgment, will enforcement efforts terminate. This will require negotiation with them towards this result. If you are not comfortable doing this, then hire a debt collection DEFENSE attorney to handle the negotiations and ensure that the correct papers are filed with the court, including the \"Satisfaction of Judgment\" in full.\n\nI have linked below my legal guide for California consumers who have a repossession to understand their rights.

    "question": "I needed to file bankruptcy. This happened before the landlord could go to trial on non payment allegations against me. The court has released the 30 day automatic stay upon motion of the landlord but did not waive the 14 day additional stay prescribed by FRBP 4001. The 4001 form order also says the landlord must file a proof of claim for these pre bankruptcy non payment alllegations pursuant to 11 USC 501 in order to pursue charges before the bankruptcy filing. The order also allows the landlord to pursue new charges of non payments after the bankruptcy filing without the claim being made to the bankruptcy court for that time frame. Since my unlawful detainer is about old charges and I want to assume my lease and keep paying rent, and the landlord had not made a new 3 day notice I assume a new trial date can’t be set for the unlawful detainer action in light of this order. Does this sound right?",

        "I will agree with both of my previous colleagues. The entire case relies on understanding the concept of visa and status. The visa will allow you to board the plane and come to the port of entry where the immigration officer will determine the entry and give you a status. At this point the status will control. Depending how much time is left on your H1B (not the visa stamp) but number of years and if you have a valid job in the US, your status will be determined based on this. We deal with many H1Bs for Indian foreign nationals. Lately, most of them are being asked to show that they actually have work in the US to enter even when they have valid visas. So make sure you have all your paperwork ready.,\n\nGood Luck\nShah Peerally\nFounder and Managing Attorney of Shah Peerally Law Group PC\nLaw Firm Deals in Immigration law, Bankruptcy & Debt Relief\n\nhttp://peerallylaw.com\n37600 Central Ct, Ste 201,\nNewark CA 94560\n510.742.5887\ninfo@peerallylaw.com\n\n\nNote: The above answer is provided for informational use only.

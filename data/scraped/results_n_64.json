    "question": "I am an individual, not a business who has a $10,000 plus interest small claim judgment against and individual who just filed chapter 7 bankruptcy. Is there any chance I can get my judgment exempt from discharge?",

    "answers": [
        "For the debtor, discharge is a good thing. It means the debt is zeroed out. A debt is exempt from discharge usually if there's a public policy exception or a specific bad act by the debtor, such as an intentional tort when the debtor intends to harm the creditor.",
        "You have great answers on here already. I simply add you can look at 11 USC 523 to see non-dischargeable type debts assuming it was a ch 7 case filed. However, many of those types of \"non-dischargeable\" debts will STILL be discharged unless a lawsuit is filed and served by a certain deadline. Hence, you might want to discuss the case on line with an attorney and just pay for that small time and possibly here on AVVO you can find that attorney. And Attorney Miller adds awesome great comment on checking also if you can use on income taxes if discharged too. Good luck.",
        "Many factors go into determining whether you have a case to seek to have your judgment not discharged. Consulting with an experienced bankruptcy attorney to discuss the related issues should be done as soon as possible. If this is not an option because you don't have sufficient basis for nondischargeability, the discharged debt would be a debt debt that is not collectible in which case you should discuss with a CPA regarding the tax benefit that may be available.",
        "Whether a debt is dischargeable or not dischargeable depends on the circumstances of the debt. Judgments that are not usually dischargeable are those which arose from an \"intentional tort\" (such as assault), fraud, or breach of fiduciary duty (which may include theft of funds from a business).\n\nIf you have a garden variety judgment for money the the defendant/debtor owes to you, it is probably dischargeable."

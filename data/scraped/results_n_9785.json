    "title": "How do I collect an arbitration award from a corrupt attorney who claims that he might go bankrupt or leave the country?",
    "question": "I was at one time represented by an attorney who turned out to be quite unethical, greatly overcharging me for various tasks. We went through binding arbitration and I was to be awarded everything I requested, about $10k. He subsequently filed a Petition against me, claiming the Arbitrator was very biased and exhibited professional misconducted during the hearing (untrue, but the only narrow grounds upon which he could potentially avoid paying, given that the arbitration was binding).",

        "I think Mr. Stone's advice was good, but this jerk will surely appeal your judgment once you get it, and that will add a year or more to the delay. have your lawyer do an asset search on Accurint.com. It is not expensive and might show a lot. I like the idea of liening his court cases. Pick ones where he is attorney for the plaintiff, but you need that judgment entered first, even if it is under appeal. This will be your advantage. THEN the appeal delay is hurting HIM, since he can't get his money til you are paid. Be sure and notify the insurance adjuster on each such case, so they know not to pay him til your lien is taken care of.\n\nDo your state bar complaint immediately, and make sure they have all your paperwork documenting your monetary losses. They can pressure him to pay you as well. Good luck.\n\nPlease be aware that my ideas are suggestions for you to look into. I don't know enough about your case to tell you you should or should not do these things. You definitely need a lawyer to guide you on these steps, but it may not be hopeless. What only you can determine is whether it is worth the emotional toll it is taking on you. For certain, diving into a sewer to catch a rat is not easy or pleasant. I can feel your stress.",
        "The first step is to file a motion to confirm the arbitration award in the Superior Court. Then you can obtain a judgment. Then you can look up all his cases and file notice of judgment lien on all his cases. You also can file an abstract of judgment with the county recorder and a J1 with the Secretary of state. This will do you best to perfect your judgment. These are inexpensive and fairly easy to do so make sure that they are done as soon as possible after the arbitration award is final. Perhaps the same judge who is ruling on his claim re the arbitrator can confirm you award into a judgment. Check with your local attorney right away.\n\npeter :)"

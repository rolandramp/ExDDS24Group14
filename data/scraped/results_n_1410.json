    "title": "Can I sue a collection agency for ruining my credit for attempting to collect a debt that was already paid in full.",
    "question": "I paid a medical debt ($61) to a collection agency in July. A different collection agency is now trying to collect that same debt and they reported it to Equifax. We are house hunting and need to get preapproved for a mortgage loan just as this happened. This is defamation of financial injury and they are trying to double collect. They have refused to delete the debt and insist on collecting a debt that has already been settled.",

        "I think you may have a good case that may entitles you to compensation. A good Consumer Protection attorney will review and investigate your case for free and likely take it for no money down. Location is irrelevant as long as they're licensed in CA. Fight back!",
        "You have a right to sue under the FDCPA and to collect compensation for your actual damages, statutory penalties and attorney's fees. You may need to sue both collection agencies because the first collection agency, whom you paid, may not have had the legal authority to collect the debt. You will need a lawyer and you will need to file a lawsuit. The second agency is not interested in doing anything; they only want your money.",
        "Yes, you can sue under both State and Federal laws. You do have a duty to mitigate your damages.",
        "You can absolutely sue, and your \"statutory damages\" (damages awarded without proving you were actually injured) could be as much as $2,000. Further, your \"actual damages\" could be whatever extra you have to pay over the life of the loan due to these misrepresentations.",
        "While you may or may not have a claim under the FDCPA and Rosenthal Act in CA, the likelihood of you convincing a jury that your credit was wrecked over a disputed $61 bill is a stretch beyond logic. If your credit score is that bad, you likely have multiple negative trade lines from multiple creditors.\n\nIf you can prove payment, send it to the collection agency At the same time go to FCC.gov and dispute the trade line by using the credit disputes link.\n\nA little self help here may get you far greater relief than a filing a nuisance FDCPA claim",
        "In theory yes, you have a right to sue under the FDCPA. In practice your damages are not enough to do anything other than small claims court. How valuable is your time?"

    "question": "my brother died a week ago and has me as a beneficiary to his checking/savings account. There is around $10,000 in his savings. There was also no will. He hardly had any possessions just clothes and furniture. His debt is around $1000. I will be getting the death certificate next week. My question is... Since i am the beneficiary on his savings account can i take out the money and pay his debt myself or do i need to leave the money in his bank account and pay off his debts first before i take out the money?",

        "Upon showing the death certificate to the bank you will be able to do what you want with the account. At that time, you should pay the debt. On the other hand, if you choose, you can certainly pay the debt first. The choice is yours.",
        "Legally, I believe that the money is yours and because there is no probate estate, you are not legally obligated to pay the debt. Having said this, there is probably a moral obligation to take care of the debt, since you know there is no other source of payment.\n\nUnless the creditor can PROVE that the beneficiary designation was an attempt to defraud creditors, which seems highly unlikely, then the creditor is likely out of luck.\n\nAs to whether you collect the money first or pay the debt first, I do not think it makes any difference. Now, if the creditor is the bank, they will probably insist the debt be paid first, and then will issue the balance of the proceeds to you.\n\nBecause the account passes to you directly, outside of probate, the presence or absence of a Will in your case does not make any difference.\n\nJames Frederick"

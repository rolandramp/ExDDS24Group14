    "title": "Going to trial with Portfolio collection agency over a debt I believe is wrong. Need advice.",
    "question": "I was served a summons in December from Portfolio collection agency from an account from a credit card a few years ago. I believe it is incorrect and so I filed a response asking for discovery. I was served a complaint originally that states 3 different credit card companies on it. Capital one, Orchard bank and HBCS bank of Nevada. I don't have any of my credit card records anymore and Today I went in for case management session and was asked if I want to go to trial. I said yes because I want proof and was told they don't have it and can't have it because they are a junk debt buyer. What should my next step be? I have 2 months until trial and can't afford an attorney but need advice. I do not have a job but my husband does and we are raising 2 grandkids right now.",

        "consult with a local debt lawyer. they can give you some advice and strategy tips. Sometimes forcing in a live witness (an experienced local attorney can help with this) in to testify by subpoenaing the person in their declaration in lieu of personal testimony which they will serve 30 days before trial will cause them to dismiss the case.",

        "Portfolio Recovery will have to prove that you owe the debts, so it sounds like you are taking the right steps. Portfolio Recovery frequently violates the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (\"FDCPA\") in their attempts to collect debts. If a debt collection agency violates the FDCPA, you are entitled to up to $1,000, and the agency also has to pay your attorneys fees and costs. If Portfolio harassed you with repeated calls or if you feel your rights were violated during their attempts to collect the debts, it would be a good idea for you to contact an experienced consumer protection attorney to discuss your case. One final note is Capital One and HSBC recently settled class actions. If you received notification that you are a member of a class action settlement, you should always check with an attorney before taking action.",
        "You need to serve proper discovery requests, tailored to your case, in the form required by Code of Civil Procedure sections 2030 and 2031. If the responses are not satisfactory, you will need to file a motion to compel further responses, in the form and in the manner required by the California Rules of Court.\n\nIf the credit card contract includes an attorney's fees provision, that provision is reciprocal. That means that if the contract states that the credit card company can recover its attorney's fees from you if it sues you, and if you successfully defend the case, you can collect your attorney's fees from the entity which is suing you.",
        "Your next step will be a motion for order in limine precluding the creditor from putting on any evidence of the debt because they have admitted they are a junk debt buyer and do not have any records. They are also not competent to produce the records much less testify.\n\nSo a motion in limine objecting to all evidence -- yes that big 7 word motion is important. Also, you should get a transcript of the case management conference and attach that to the motion in limine objecting to all evidence.\n\nWhen you get to trial, move for involuntary dismissal if the motion in limine is granted, and motion for judgment of directed verdict or involuntary dismissal when you get to trial. Object whenever they try and put in evidence on the following grounds:\n\na. Competence -- the witness is not competent to testify about a debt they have no records of;\nb. Hearsay -- the witness's statements about the debt being owed is hearsay and inadmissible; and\nc. Unfair prejudice -- you demanded discovery and they produced nothing; therefore they are precluded from sandbagging you at trial via unfair and prejudicial surprise."

    "title": "How much will the assistance for a completion of a Mini Probate cost me??? I am in need of one, ASAP - In advance, Thank you",
    "question": "My Grandfather passed and years before his passing we took out a 50,000.00 loan to consolidate our debts. His and my name are on the deed, which I had modified. However due to the outstanding loan, I must complete a probate.",
    "answers": [
        "It sounds like your grandfather's share might be under $150,000, so you need a summary proceeding called a Petition to Determine Succession to Real Property. While costs do vary, this process is generally quicker and easier than a full probate. Avvo is not for client solicitation so you should use the Find a Lawyer tab and contact a few attorneys to discuss your situation with. Good luck to you.",
        "What do you mean by \"mini probate\"? This term is not known to me.",
        "Probate costs vary. Consult local probate counsel to assess matter and quote fee.",
        "Hello,\n\nYou may also want to contact the Kern County Bar Association for attorney referrals.",
        "You should consult with several local probate attorneys in your area. Many attorney consultations are free. The attorneys will be in a better position to assess your debts and liabilities and can answer your cost question. Good luck."

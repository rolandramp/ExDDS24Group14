    "title": "My lawyer botched my Chapter 13 and second mortgage stripping case. The LAM motion was never filed.",
    "question": "I\"m three years into my five year repayment plan. I found out that my lawyer supposedly never filed the LAM motion. For some unknown reason, the court approved the plan anyway. The trustee had been treating my $125,000 second mortgage as a secured loan instead an unsecured, and has paid the lender $29,000 so far, instead of to the correct payees. My lawyer was disbarred about a year ago and has left the state. My home value has increased to well over the amount of the first mortgage, so filing a new case would not work. I have done everything right (except get into debt in the first place). What can be done?",
    "answers": [
        "I wouldn't see this as hopeless as my colleagues. The value of your house as applicable for a lienstripping was the value at the date of filing, so if you hire an experienced Chapter 13 attorney, the appraisal you originally obtained for the unfiled motion should be good to use. Most of the times, the second mortgage companies do not oppose the lienstrip motion. Oh, and the money paid to the 2nd mortgage lender? It can be recovered by the Chapter 13 trustee. Hope this perspective helps!",
        "File the LAM motion (or motion to value depending on your judge) right away. Make sure you have an appraisal of the homes value as of the date of the filing of the bankruptcy. There is nothing you can do about the money the trustee has already paid to the second mortgage, however if you are able to make it through your Chapter 13 case to discharge you will still be able to strip the lien. You may need to do a motion to modify your plan depending on the percentage that is supposed to be paid to the unsecured creditors and the amount of your arrears on the first. As for the disbarment issue you need to hire a new lawyer to represent you for the remainder of your case and make sure you get your Chapter 13 discharge and properly strip your lien. You also may want to file a complaint with the state bar or you can file a malpractice action but you may not be able to collect.",
        "You may still file file an adversary proceeding to eliminate the second mortgage, but you have an uphill battle. There is a split of opinion regarding valuation for purposes of a lien strip, namely the date of filing, or the date of confirmation. The majority opinion seems to be the date of filing. Depending on what happens in your jurisdiction, you may need to obtain an appraisal for one, or both of those time periods. The second mortgage may fight this given the gravy train that it appears to be on. You must speak with an experienced attorney to deal with this issue. It is not the end of your ability to strip the lien, and if you are going to sue this disbarred attorney (does he have malpractice insurance) you must try to mitigate your damages, which means reduce the amount of your damages by at least trying to strip the lien. Good luck.",
        "I agree with Ms. Bunce. The value of the house will go back to the date of filing. Since you are still in the bankruptcy you will be able to strip the lien, and recover the funds already paid to the lender. As a matter of course and just professional courtesy I am loathe to recommend a malpractice filing, but that is a side issue. While suing for malpractice will give you personal feeling of accomplishment the more important issue to resolve is how to remove this lien. I would contact another attorney, with chapter 13 experience in your area. Make sure that they know the specific facts and review your case filing from PACER. They will be able to resolve this for you. Additionally, it may be possible to negotiate with the creditor to strip the lien. This may be your best alternative as it would require the least amount of work, and have no opposition. Many lien holders realize their position and therefore have no interest in a fight they wont win. It will come down to whether the house is worth less than the first and if all parties realize that it is they will be happy to receive what they have already received.",
        "Your options appear to be limited as stated already. If you can find the disbarred attorney, you can file the malpractice suit and hope that he had malpractice insurance coverage in place at the time of the malpractice and that the coverage limits have not been exceeded by other claims against him.\n\nIt is a long shot, but you may be able to modify the plan reducing the percentage to unsecured claims which may help some. The problem with that is that you need to show a material change in circumstances. The best option is to talk with an experienced bankruptcy attorney that is willing to take on tough cases like yours. You can search for an attorney using the Avvo \"Find a Lawyer\" link at the top of his page.",
        "I agree with Mr. Brenda. A malpractice case seems to be the only way forward. Your damages look like they are $125,000 less what ever the holder of the second would have been paid as an unsecured creditor.\nThe question is a little unclear as to who the trustee should have paid instead of the holder of the second.",
        "Sounds as if your only remedy is to sue your lawyer for malpractice."

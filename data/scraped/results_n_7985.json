    "answers": [
        "Like everyone said above, there is no magic number that your credit score will decrease after your discharge. However, you have a few things going for you. If you keep one or both of the cars, reaffirm the debt, and continue to pay on the vehicles then they will continue to report that you are paying. Furthermore I suggest you go online and get a secured credit card. Using it for 12 months, consistently, after bankruptcy increases your credit score.",
        "Calculating a credit score is complicated and depends on many factors making it impossible to answer this question. If you want to improve your credit score do the following things:\n\n1. Pay your bills on time;\n2. Use 25 percent or less of your available credit; and\n3. Maintain steady employment.\n\nObviously number 3 may be beyond your control, but these are three factors that affect your credit rating. After your discharge you should no longer be liable for your unsecured debts, excepting student loans, so factor number 2 should be a point in your favor. That leaves paying your bills on time. Also, try and avoid applying for too many new lines of credit. That hurts your rating as well.",
        "As someone who looks at lots of credit scores both before & after a bankruptcy is filed, my experience is that there is no \"magic number\" that results to the credit score after filing bankruptcy. Most of the credit scoring processing appears to be about ratios and percentages, and bankruptcy would appear to fall in that category.\n\nSo what does this mean?\n\nIf you still had a high credit score when you filed bankruptcy, expect to lose more points than someone who had a low credit score when they filed bankruptcy.\n\nHope this perspective helps!",
        "Bankruptcy will affect your credit score no matter what you do within it (surrender or not should have no bearing). How much depends on proprietary calculations. No one can tell you that information. You can repair your credit by paying bills on time and getting a secured card or paying on loans that were not discharged in your bankruptcy. There is no quick fix."

        "For purposes of this response, I am assuming that you are a beneficiary of your cousin’s will. I agree that the Probate Court has authority over these matters. If the probate of the estate has already begun, there are very specific procedures that the executor must follow in order to finalize the Probate and distribute the estate. The executor is also a fiduciary and any breaches of the executor’s fiduciary duties is a serious matter. Probate Code § 9601 sets forth actions that the court may take against an executor/personal representative for such breaches of duties.\n\nAs a beneficiary, you have the right to receive various notices, accountings, and other documents from the executor. One of the initial matters after the filing of a Petition, is the completion and filing of an Inventory and Appraisal. The assigned probate referee will appraise all non-cash property of the estate while the executor appraises all cash property under Probate Code § 8901-8902. The Inventory and Appraisal concerns the assets and property of the decedent but does not include the estate’s financial obligations. The decedent’s debts and other financial obligations are contained in the estate accounting. Generally, the accounting in most Probate matters is submitted just prior to distribution of the estate to beneficiaries, although in some cases interim accountings may also be required.\n\nIf the executor’s action are as problematic as you suspect, you should not wait until distribution to consider an action to protect the estate.

Any investments or assets that have not been included in the Inventory and Appraisal and that have not been properly explained by the executor would be included in your petition. I do agree that there could be legitimate reasons why the value of the estate has decreased.

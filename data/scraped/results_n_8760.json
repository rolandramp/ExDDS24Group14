        "A special circumstance applies here in California for junior loans that are \"purchase money loans.\" If they were taken out to purchase the borrower’s property, then the lender has no right to pursue the borrower for the amount owed - their only remedy is the property, even if the property was foreclosed by the first loan holder. So borrowers have special protections if the loans they were given by the lenders were used to buy the property.\n\nUnfortunately, a lot of lenders are from out of state and do not realize the unique protections provided to property owners with purchase money loans here in California. So they try to intimate borrowers with collection letters and with threats of wage garnishments as a way to coerce payments.\n\nAnd the big mistake homeowners make is turning a \"non-recourse\" second loan into a \"recourse\" loan by refinancing it. A non-recourse loan is a loan that the bank can only look to their secured interest.\n\nSo how is a second mortgage a non-recourse loan? Simple, it was \"purchase money\" for your property. A purchase money loan is one where the money went from the lender, to escrow, and then to the seller or to pay purchase closing costs. In California purchase money loans made on your property are non-recourse. It's as simple as that.\n\nSo, before even thinking of walking away, the borrower must first determine if the loans are purchase money loans or not – this is critical to whether or not the junior lien holders can pursue the borrower for a judgment. Second, if the loans are not purchase money, then the borrower must do everything possible to prevent the first lender from foreclosing and creating a sold out junior lien holder, that can then pursue the borrower with a lawsuit to obtain a judgment for the amount of the loan.\n\nMy advice to someone who has tried to save their home through a modification but was unsuccessful is PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE do something to settle the HELOC BEFORE it’s too late. THEY WILL WORK WITH YOU but you are much better off trying to work something out BEFORE the HELOC is sold out of the property by the first’s foreclosure. Once it is released, they are more likely to want substantially more money. I know of cases where they have been settled for 1-3% of the outstanding balance (or $1,000 - $5,000 etc.).\n\nAnd if you negotiate with the first lender to do a short sale, make sure the HELOC or second is onboard. Otherwise you might have resolved your issues with the first, but after the short sale the HELOC or second will serve you with a lawsuit. Make sure to negotiate with the second lien holder prior to the short sale for debt forgiveness....\n\n\nFinally, if the lender receives less than the amount of its loan from the foreclosure sale, then it will send you a 1099 for the difference. The fact that you, in effect, paid less than the amount you owed is called mortgage debt relief. If you receive mortgage debt relief, then this is considered taxable income.\n\nThe federal congress has exempted, for the short foreseeable future, any taxable income that would result from mortgage debt relief on your primary residence. If this is the house that you and your family live in, and it is your primary residence, then you will not have to pay federal tax on the 1099 you receive for mortgage relief.\n\nCall my office as I think you should obtain an injunction to gain time to negotiate with the second lien holder.\n\nwww.michielawfirm.com",
        "I agree with the previous response, this is a title company issue, and you probably have to sue them to get them to do anything for you as once the foreclosure sale takes place, you are most likely out of luck. I would also add that although that loan was a previous second, it has now become a first because the loan that had been senior to it was paid off. My office handles these types of cases, and if you would like to discuss it further, we can set up a free consultation for you. Good luck.",
        "If it is true that the second mortgage was validly recorded and the borrower is in default, then the lender has the right to do the trustee's sale. Since you had nothing to do with the mortgage, you only recourse is against the title company and possibly the seller. However, I can't think of any issue against the seller ( for nondisclosure of a second deed of trust). I would imagine that you received a preliminary title report before you closed escrow. If the mortgage is on the report, there was no way the title company would allow escrow to close without making sure to have it paid off. Have you reviewed your settlement statement to find out if any part of your money was used to pay off mortgages? This is an unthinkable situation. I wish I've seen your paperwork. It's hard to make sense of this without seeing anything."

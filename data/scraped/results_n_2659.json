    "title": "I had an overpayment of $9,000 to the State EDD.",
    "question": "I went through a Chapter 7 Bankruptcy and the state did not bring up any issues with that. My bankruptcy went through and my debts were dissolved. Should I still be worried about the state coming after me for the money or was the overpayment discharged along with all my other debts? As a side note, I was able to collect my state tax refund last year.",
    "answers": [
        "EDD overpayments are routinely discharged in C7 BK. If EDD did not object to discharge, the debt is discharged. Possible exception to discharge if any fraud was involved.",
        "I agree with my colleagues...if the EDD did not obtain an order indicating that the debt is not dischargeable, then the debt was discharged. Congratulations on your fresh start.",
        "Generally, tax debts owed to the gov't are non-dischargeable. However, as pointed out out by others, an \"overpayment\" by the government to you does not fall into the category of a \"tax debt\". If the government creditor can prove you rec'd the overpayment amounts due to some fraud on your part, the debt would not be discharged. Since your post suggests no government creditor filed an objection to the discharge of the debt, and your case is closed, no action can be taken by the state at this point.",
        "Your overpayment was discharged as part of your bankruptcy case if the state did not object to the dischargeability of the overpayment.",
        "Unemployment overpayments are routinely discharged in chapter 7. If you are concerned you can call the EDD and ask if they show you as owing money at this time."

    "title": "Can creditor file a 1099 on a debt that has been written off",
    "question": "I have a huge hospital debt that I am not able to pay back. I have a small amount of money in saving & if I offer this to the hospital and they accept it as a final payment can they file a 1099 for the remaining balance which the IRS would then bill me for",
    "answers": [
        "If you're negotiating a settlement, one of the things you can negotiate for is for the creditor to not report anything negative to the credit bureaus (and/or to remove what they've already reported), and to treat the settlement as a non-taxable event for you. Whether they'd agree to that I don't know, but you can ask, especially if you've got the leverage of a plausible threat to file for bankrupcty protection so they'd get nothing.\n\nDisclaimer: Please note that this answer does not constitute legal advice, and should not be relied on, since each state has different laws, each situation is fact specific, and it is impossible to evaluate a legal problem without a comprehensive consultation and review of all the facts and documents at issue. This answer does not create an attorney-client relationship.",
        "Forgiveness of debt may be reported to the IRS using a 1099-C. There is no guarantee that they will do this, but they may. If they send you a 1099, you need to consult with a tax advisor as to any tax consequence on your tax return. At the very least, your tax return will need to reflect how you treated the 1099 income, you should not just omit any reference to it from your return. You should not wait for the IRS to come after you with a bill, as the IRS also charges interest and penalties. Also, the IRS is not perfect and they may handle it incorrectly."

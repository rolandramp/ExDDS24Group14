        "It is impossible to say without more information. You really need to talk to a bankruptcy law attorney. You are now in a position to lose your driver's license for driving without insurance. A bankruptcy filing will allow you to keep your license. I have seen this issue come up for over 40 years of doing this. The question is going to be a lot more complicated depending on things like the size of your family, what assets you have and whether they are protectable, and much, much more.\n\nDo yourself a huge favor and see a quality bankruptcy attorney to find out what can be done for you. If you end up filing bankruptcy, your case would be filed in the Bankruptcy Court in Sacramento. I would recommend you find a quality bankruptcy attorney with many years of experience.

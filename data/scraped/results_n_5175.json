        "The Order to Appear for Examination has a box that can be checked to bring documents. If this box was not checked, then you don't need to bring any documents. They can only ask questions of you under oath. However, if this default judgment is not set aside, they can request another one of these examinations in 121 days, so they can simply do this again in four months, next time with the correct box checked. I should also note that each time they spend costs on this, that is added to the judgment. If the judgment provided for attorney's fees, they can also add attorney's fees for each hearing. Thus, it is up to you if you want to bring the documents and if you have money and are unemployed, they will probably not want to expend any more time and money on this case. The court will not order you to pay anything at the examination.\n\nRobert Stempler (please see DISCLAIMER below)\nwww.StopCollectionLawsuits.com\nwww.facebook.com/SoCalConsumerLawyer\nTwitter: @RStempler"

        "The debt you owe to the family member will be discharged in your Chapter 7, but the obligation that you owe to your ex-wife pursuant to the divorce court order will not be. You might be able to get rid of that debt to your ex-wife in a Chapter 13 case, so you should discuss that possibility with your attorney.\n\nMark J.

        "First, Chapter 7 is harder than ever to get after all of the 2008 mess. You will need to speak to a bankruptcy attorney to see if it is even feasible. If it is, you can probably get rid of that debt, but without seeing the paperwork, it is hard to be certain."

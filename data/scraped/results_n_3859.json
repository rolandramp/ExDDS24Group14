        "The U.S. Bankruptcy Court Norther District of California has an opinion on this topic that may be of help. In in re Early, the Court stated: Defendant's PACA Liability Is Nondischargeable Under Section 523(a)(4) Pursuant to section 523(a)(4), a debt for defalcation while acting in a fiduciary capacity is nondischargeable. For the court's opinion follow the link here: http://www.canb.uscourts.gov/node/914\n\nIf you believe your rights or those of your boss are at risk, you should contact an experienced bankruptcy lawyer in your area for a consultation and a more complete analysis based on specific facts related to this bankruptcy filing and the underlying debt.\n\nBest of luck",
        "Chapter 7 cases do not send out a proof of claim because most of the time there is no assets that can be used to pay claims. So the fact that no notice was sent does not make one wit of a difference. See the case of In Re Beezely for more information - this case is sufficiently well known that you can easily find it with an online search. Hope this perspective helps!",
        "If the bankruptcy was a no-asset chapter 7 filed in California and the debt was not one of the types on this list: http://law.abi.org/#/title11/523 then it would have been discharged and there is nothing your boss can do about it. If it was an asset Chapter 7, then there may be some relief available but your boss should consult with a bankruptcy attorney who represents creditors for more information.",
        "If the debtor's case was a \"no asset\" case there are limited options. If your boss had reason to object to the discharge of his debt and got no notice of the \"no asset\" BK, he can file an adversary complaint after moving the court to reopen the case and have the dischargeabilty of his debt determined by the BK Court. He needs to contact an experienced Creditor's Rights atty in his area by clicking on the AVVO tab \"Find a Lawyer\". Many offer free consultations. Depending on the amount involved, he should move quickly now that he is aware of the BK and that he was not listed."

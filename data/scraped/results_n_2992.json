    "title": "Will shareholder of CA S Corp be personally liable for line of credit debt after dissolution?",
    "question": "It's a Wells Fargo line that has been in place for 10+ years and is attached to the corporation's business account. It basically operates like a credit card. There is no original docs so I don't know if there was any personal guarantee clause.",

    "answers": [
        "Dissolution mean distributing both assets and liabilities.\n\nFurther, you should suspect there was a personal guaranty since the big banks over collateralize all debt in every manner they can. Without reviewing the documents, all this is just an \"educated guess\".",
        "Not necessarily, but much depends on whether or not the line was guaranteed personally. WFB can find the original docs... they have a research department and that is one of their tasks. Another question is what the funds from the line were used for... if they were used for personal (rather than business) purposes, it is more likely to find personal liability for the debts.",
        "It depends...\n\nAn S Corporation is a pass through, with the income and expenses of the corporation passing through to the individuals behind the company.\n\nI agree with Mr. Doland. Without seeing the origination documents, I would assume there is a personal guarantee. You may not have records, but I would bet the bank does.\n\nI recommend you consult with an attorney to assist with the dissolution."

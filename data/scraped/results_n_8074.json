    "title": "What happens if a corporation dissolves during a litigation?",
    "question": "I read it in a blog: according to LeCrenier v. Central Oil Asphalt Corp., C.A. No. 4927-VCN (Del. Ch. Dec. 22, 2010), a corporation, when it is sued, retains its corporate existence until the conclusion of a lawsuit even if the corporation dissolves. Is California law the same as DE law? Also, assuming that the court rules against the corporation in a civil suit, who pays the damages?",

        "The corporation cannot dissolve with pending litigation.\n\nTo dissolve, file a Certificate of Election to Wind Up and Dissolve (Form ELEC STK) and a Certificate of Dissolution (Form DISS STK), unless the election to dissolve is made by the vote of all the outstanding shares, in which case only the Certificate of Dissolution (Form DISS STK) is required; -or-, in limited circumstances, a Short Form Certificate of Dissolution (Form DSF STK) may be filed.\n\nHowever, the Certificate of Dissolution must include a statement concerning the disposition of the corporation's known debts and liabilities. The Certificate of Dissolution must state that the known debts and liabilities have been paid, or that the corporation never incurred any known debts or liabilities, or that the known debts and liabilities have been adequately provided for. If there are known debts and liabilities for which adequate provision has been made, the certificate must set forth what provision has been made, including the name and address of the corporation, person or governmental agency that has assumed or guaranteed the payment, or the name and address of the depositary with which deposit has been made, or any other information necessary to enable the creditor to claim payment of the debt or liability. (California Corporations Code section 1905(a)(2).)",
        "The CA Secretary of State shouldn't allow a corporation to dissolve pending litigation, because the form that has to be filed (Certificate of Dissolution) states that a final tax return has been filed, and that known debts have been paid, or that someone has agreed to assume them. If litigation is pending, then the extent of the debt can't be known, but I guess it could be assumed that it was the maximum judgment possible, and if someone agreed to to assume that debt, the corporation could be dissolved.",
        "Although I don't specifically know California law I believe that this is a pretty general issue that will not vary with state law. Generally, a corporation cannot simply disolve while there is pending litigation against it. Typically in that situation a corporation would file bankruptcy and have to go through that process to go out of business. There could be reasons to avoid bankruptcy and in those situations a shareholder or shareholders might continue to pay the expenses of litigation but unless there are assets in the corporation then there would be no money to pay any damages.\n\nIn certain very limited circumstances (ie where a corporation is intentionally underfunded) it is possible that after a judgment is obtained that a lawsuit could be brought against the shareholder(s) to \"pierce the corporate veil\" and execute on the judgment against their personal assets. Otherwise, there isn't likely to be any recovery and if that were the situation, the case would likely be dropped because there is no point in going through the expense of getting a judgment against the company that has no assets."

    "title": "My sister is filing bankruptcy, and has been paying me back for money she borrowed. Can the courts take my money?",
    "question": "My sister borrowed $20,000.00 from me and is now going to file for bankruptcy. She said that if she can show that she hasn't been paying me for a year, that the courts will dismiss the loan. But if I keep records that she has been paying me, that the courts will take that money from me. How can this be??? I didn't do anything wrong, and I'm just trying to collect the money she borrowed from me!",

        "Yikes. Be careful. How much money has she repaid back to you over the past year? That will make a huge difference. You're right you did nothing wrong but unfortunately the BK Code has that rule about \"insider payments\" and so the belief there is that ALL creditors should be treated equally the same. My advice is to make sure she talks with her attorney about the specifics of her case and how it may impact you. She can always, once the debt is Discharged, pay you back voluntarily and so my main concern would be whether the Trustee will demand of you to give back whatever amounts she's paid to you over the past year.",
        "I agree with the previous answers. It may feel like you are being punished for simply trying to help your sister, but unfortunately there is a very specific law designed for your sister's particular situation. People that are filing bankruptcy are usually in financial distress. However, sometimes those people feel like a certain credit card or doctor or family member has been especially good to them and they want ot repay those specific debts. Unfortunately, while that may seem like an innocent enough idea, what is happening in the eyes of the bankruptcy court is that this person intending to file for bankruptcy is paying off some debts while leaving other creditors with less potential property to recover their debts from. Bankruptcy is supposed to be an orderly process, and when the debtor tries to pay off some creditors, they perform something called a \"preference.\" Your sister may be a bit confused about this. She has to disclose any payments she made to you within 1 year before filing. If they were regular monthly payments and she still has money she owes you that may be a good defense. Like the other attorneys pointed out, the safest thing to do is to wait 1 year from when she last made a payment to you. However, if that is not an option, you can attempt to return the money to your sister and have her attorney exempt the money and once your sister gets her discharge, she will be able to do with funds as she pleases. At that point she can return the money to you. Hope this helps.\n\nNo attorney-client relationship was created. This is general information only and you can consult an attorney for legal advice.

        "Attorney Curl's answer is absolutely correct. Bankruptcy code section 547 authorizes a trustee to avoid preferential transfers including those to insiders such as family members.

        "Payments by a debtor to a family member, business associate or persons of a close relationship (called \"insiders\") are potential problems. Payments to a family member is called a preference, because the payments were made to creditors you may have preferred over another.

This is something that your sister should consult with her counsel about to work toward a possible solution. Good luck.\n\nThis information is not, nor is it intended to be, legal advice.

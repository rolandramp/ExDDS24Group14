    "title": "Can a person with two social security numbers apply for chapter 7 BK?",
    "question": "I came to the US in 1994, when I was 23 years old. I used a fake social security number to get credit (credit cards and car loans) under my name. I became a legal resident in the US a couple of years ago and now have a real social security number. However, most of my debts I got under that fake one. Can I apply for chapter 7 bankruptcy and which social security should I use?",

        "Under section 727 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code a discharge can de denied entirely to a filer who has engaged in conduct to hinder, defraud or delay creditors. You can google up that section of the Bankruptcy Code to see the individual subsections. However, in my opinion you are not eligible for a discharge. You might retain an experienced bankruptcy attorney with a oenchant and desire for litigation to pursue the issue.\n\nThis answer is offered for informational purposes only.

        "You can file Chapter 7 bankruptcy, but the credit (and resulting debt) that you obtained using the fake social security number aren't likely to be discharged because you received the credit under false pretenses/fraudulently using a false social security number.\n\nAssuming you meet the criteria for filing Chapter 7, the debts under your real social security number can be discharged. You must use your correct social security number when filing. You sign a statement of social security number and all the other documents in your petition under the penalty of perjury.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This response is for informational purposes only and does not form an attorney-client relationship.

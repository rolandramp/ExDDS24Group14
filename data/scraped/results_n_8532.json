        "Debtor's have rights! That is why they are called debtors. The bankruptcy code provides for an orderly discharge of debts. Chapter 7 of the bankruptcy code allows a debtor to discharge debt in exchange for a liquidation of the debtor's assets.\n\nDischarge of debt is the right most debtors are concerned about. The debtor also has a right to keep at least $27,000 of property that cannot be liquidated. That little bit of property allows the debtor to have a fresh start after the debts are discharged. In many cases a debtor can keep many more assets depending on what they are, i.e. retirement benefits.\n\nThe debtor also has a right to stop almost all creditors from taking property while the bankruptcy process is going unless the court gives the creditor permission. In a chapter 7, this protection last for about 90 days. However, any debts discharged are forever barred from any collection action by creditors.\n\nIn a chapter 13, the debtor can get protection from creditors for up to 5 years. This can allow a debtor to stop a mortgage company from foreclosing or a car lender from repossessing. This protection only lasts as long as the debtor submits a plan that the court can approve. Chapter 13 cases are much more difficult than chapter 7 and many attorneys do not feel up to the challenge.\n\nIt is important to find a good bankruptcy attorney, especially if you are considering chapter 13. You need someone who understands your rights and your responsibilities. You also need someone who organizes their business in such a way that you get information timely.\n\nAttorneys sell information and it is important that your attorney keep you informed and answer your questions. Unfortunately, there are so many people needing bankruptcy attorneys, that many of the attorneys are following the clients. They do not always know your right or responsibilities and just want your money.\n\nI cannot emphasize the import of finding an attorney who is not afraid to work, communicates well with you, and understands the law. You do not need to be afraid of your creditors rights because you have rights too. Good luck and feel free to interview many attorneys for your case.

        "The first thing you need to do if and when you get sued is file an Answer.

        "If you've received a summons and complaint regarding your credit card debt, then the 5 months is probably in reference to some sort of a status conference.\n\nHowever, you still need to respond to the debt complaint in 30 days otherwise you may get a default judgment entered against you. The longer you wait the harder it may be to get a deal from them or debt settlement.\n\nYou have to contact the credit card’s attorney because AMEX will only refer you to them. No need to discuss with the judge because the judge can't force AMEX's attorney to take a deal. You have to talk to the attorney that sued you and try to work out a deal with them, but don't forget to file a response first.",
        "When you are sued on a debt, you have no leverage to negotiate a settlement unless you file a response to the lawsuit immediately. When you do not respond, the creditor obtains a judgment for the full amount & obtains a wide range of options to collect from you, making your life miserable. Legal fees & court costs get added to the original amount you owe.\n\nBy filing an answer, you make the creditor have to work to obtain a judgment, and no one likes to work. That will give you the leverage to settle.\n\nBTW, making payments is not condusive to settling. You have to have your offer be for a lump sum or pay almost the entire amount.\n\nHope this perspective helps!",
        "In response to your question about negotiation and settlement of credit card debt in CA, if you have been served with a Summons and Complaint, you have 30 days from the date of service to file an Answer or General Denial. I am not sure what the 5 months is, perhaps a status conference or the trial, but you need to timely respond to the Complaint or else be in default.\n\nIf you do reach a debt settlement, then you should have a written settlement agreement and release which specifically states that the amount you are paying is in full satisfaction of the alleged debt. In the future, no attorney, assignee, or collection agency can later go after you for the balance.\n\nSince the lawsuit has already been filed, you should be dealing with the attorney, not Amex directly. Do not go to court to discuss anything with the judge (other than at a regularly scheduled court hearing).\n\nIf the attorney is not responding to your settlement offers (and assuming you've filed your Answer or General Denial), then most likely you will have to wait until the court refers the case to mediation before you can meaningfully discuss settlement."

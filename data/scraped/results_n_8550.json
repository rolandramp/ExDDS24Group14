    "question": "The bank supposed to foreclose my cousin's house next week so she filed for Chapter 13 BK today to prevent it from happening. However, now she is changing her mind and doesn't want to go through with her BK filing. She asked if she can quitclaim the house to my name and have me take care of the foreclosure problem instead of her, since I am is preparing to file for Chapter 7 BK. 1)Can she quitclaim the house to me after her initial BK Chapter 13 filing but still have many documents missing to fully execute the filing? 2) What will happen to the house or what will the bank do since my cousin's name is on the loan but my name is on the title. 3) Can she really be saved by quitclaim the house to me and let me handle the problems?",

        "Quitclaiming to someone else who is going to file for bankruptcy is a way to delay the foreclosure. By transferring the title to you by quitclaim, the automatic stay that takes effect when you file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy will prevent the bank from selling the house without first seeking permission from the bankruptcy court. It is an abuse of the automatic stay. When you file for bankruptcy your case will be affected by the scheme to have the property quitclaimed to you for no real reason but to take advantage of the automatic stay. The court might deem your involvement to be in bad faith and you could be denied a discharge or who knows what else depending on the circumstances. Your cousin should either dismiss her case if it was only filed to stop the sale or convert to Chapter 7 if she needs to have debts discharged such as credit card bills or a second loan on the house she is about to lose. You should stay away from your cousins problems. She needs to see a lawyer to find the best alternative for her situation and not get you involved in her problems, particularly since there will be little or no benefit to anyone.",

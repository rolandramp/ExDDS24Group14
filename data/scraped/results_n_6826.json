        "You really should be represented by counsel in your divorce proceeding. You should ask your lawyer about this. I think you should be able to buy a car. I would suggest that you use separate property funds for it, or she may decide she likes the new car better than the one you gave her. Just use funds that you had prior to the marriage if you segregated them. Or use money that you have earned by working since the date of separation, which should also be separate property. Use funds earned during the marriage (community property funds) to pay any community debts."

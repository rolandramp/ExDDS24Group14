        "You should really get an attorney to review your situation. Talk of trusts and legal separations raises red flags to me and I would want to see all of the paperwork regarding the trust, the separation and the debts. That being said, the simplest answer is that liability on a debt is determined by state law and the filing of the bankruptcy will not change that. The filing of a legal separation will not change that. Depending upon your situation, a substantial amount of information regarding you spouses income and expenses may be required for a bankruptcy filing, but without more information, it's hard to know.",
        "I am somewhat confused. Let me try by giving you some basic rules. Bankruptcy does not create liability for a debt. Debts are created prior to filing for Bankruptcy. If the non-filing spouse was not liable for a debt prior to filing, I don't see how it is that non-filing spouse could be liable for a debt after filing.",
        "You are wrong in liability for spouse. Whether you are liable for a separated spouses debts has nothing to do with which bankruptcy you or they file..as that does not govern liability. Any debt a debtor has when filing must be listed in any bankrupty. PERIOD. And the filing of either ch 7 or 13 wont discharge the debt to a separated spouse either as if it their debt your discharge does not remove the liability (some exceptions in a ch 13 if you pay 100% of the debt they are codebtor of). Good luck. PS if you lived in Ca or a community liability state elsewhere, any debt during the marriage is both of yours before separation no matter whos name it is ..(exceptions apply to anything but rare...like them shooting a bank teller to rob them..that is not a community debt unless you were in on it is just an example)."

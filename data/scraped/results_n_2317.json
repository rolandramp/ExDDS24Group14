    "title": "After a court judgment against my debtor, his employer refuses to respond to a Writ of Execution for wage garnishment.",
    "question": "I won a judgment against a defendant who owes me money. I have filed paper work to have his employer garnish his wages. Although his employer received the Writ of Execution in Dec. 2014, they have so far refused to respond to the Writ, or comply with the wage garnishment. What can I do?",

        "I believe a Writ of Garnishment is the proper action.",
        "There are a number of ways to enforce the judgment. A writ of execution served on the employer is only one step. if the employer refuses to assert the federal exemption and disclose the amounts due after calculating this, then you can go back to court and seek a judgment against the employed.\n\nThe other way is if the employer is really paying the employee as an independent contractor, then you can seek an assignment order instead.\n\nClick on \"Find a Lawyer\" above and consult with a collections attorney to assist you in executing on your judgment.",
        "You may have remedies against the employer. Is your debtor a W-2 employee or a 1099 \"employee\"? You can bring the employer to court to examine him/her in a procedure similar to a judgment debtor examination. Make sure that you have the correct, legal name of the employer. A dba is not sufficient. Check the corporate records to be sure that you know the names of all of the officers of the corporation. And, if the employee is fired because you started a garnishment, the employer is violating the law and you have further recourse."

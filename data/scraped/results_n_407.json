    "title": "Assets protections - lien stripping?",
    "question": "I have frivolous lawsuit filed against me 8 months ago. I have only car worth about $30,000. What's the best assets protection plan I can use to protect that car? Can someone lend me money for 10-15 years and put lien on my car, so in worst case scenario plaintiff will ge nothing from me?",
    "answers": [
        "If the lawsuit is frivolous, after winning, perhaps with a motion for summary judgment, you can sue the other side for malicious prosecution.\nIf the lawsuit is not frivolous and you lose, by that time (1 to 2 years) the car will no longer be worth $30,000.",
        "My colleagues are correct. That said, lien stripping is only available in a Chapter 13 when you own real estate in which you live and any voluntary lien might be able to be removed if you have limited or no equity in your home. Remember, BK is more than checking boxes on forms you find online. Find/consult/hire a lawyer using the Avvo feature \"Find a Lawyer\". Make a list of 4-5 having many 5 star reviews from satisfied clients. If you don't get a prompt call back from one, go on to the next on your list. Some of us offer a free consultation by phone or in person. Take us up on it. Because the bankruptcy process can be handled entirely by phone, email and fax, there is no need to personally visit the lawyer’s office unless you want to. Don’t be limited by the location of the BK lawyers you select. According to statistics reported by the United States Trustee, virtually all non-lawyer 13s are dismissed before completion, including many that fail to even get confirmed. If you want to avoid becoming one of these statistics, please get a lawyer to help you.",
        "Well, if the lawsuit is frivolous, then defend it. If a judgement has been entered against you, then a judge or jury didn’t think it was all that frivolous. What you are seeking to do is to protect your assets from being liquidated to satisfy the judgement, presumably. It will take a lot of maneuvering to force the sale of your vehicle.\n\nThis is not a bank, so no one is going to lend you money. Go to a bank in your area and apply for a loan. Or seek some assistance from your friends or family.\n\nIf that does not work for you, seek the advice of a bankruptcy attorney",
        "There is a much better alternative that will actually protect your car. Depending on your overall financial situation, Bankruptcy may be right for you. An experienced CA Bankruptcy attorney will be able to determine which type of Bankruptcy, if any is the correct one for you. Use AVVO's Find a Lawyer tool to select a qualified attorney. Good luck. THIS IS NOT LEGAL ADVICE! YOU NEED TO SPEAK TO AN ATTORNEY WHO IS LICENSED IN YOUR STATE FOR LEGAL ADVICE. This is merely suggestions for you to think about in discussing your situation with the local attorney."

    "title": "FL – 142 form (Schedule of Assets and Debts) do I put current information or at the time of the separation from two years ago?",
    "question": "We have been separated with my husband for more than 2 years and only now we have started the legal proceedings. When I complete the FL – 142 form (Schedule of Assets and Debts) do I put current information or at the time of the separation from two years ago? For example, I had much bigger balance on my credit card when I moved out 2 years ago and now I almost paid it off, the credit card has been closed since I moved out and I am just paying the balance. The other thing, my bank account had zero when I moved out and now I have some money there. So, do I put numbers that were at the time of the separation or I have to put the current information? Thank you.",

        "You are to include bank statements as of date of separation and current. The information as of date of separation will show the balance as of date of separation. The increased bank balance would be your separate property assuming the money came from earnings post separation. The credit card balances as of date of separation versus the current balances will show the pay down on the cards which you are entitled to one half reimbursement from husband. Make sure you attach the statements. I would consult with an attorney. Take your documents in so the attorney can assist with the analysis.",
        "When listing your savings account you would put \"P\" or \"R\" depending if you are petitioner or respondent in the box to indicate that it is your separate property and list a date after separation or sometimes if the dates varies because the money was earned over time I put in the date box \"ADOS\" or \"AS\" meaning \"After Date of Separation\" of \"After Separation\"\n\nWhen listing debts incurred during marriage I do the same in the date acquired \"DM\" during marriage. In the description, for example would list Visa (petitioner has paid off $1K with separate funds, current balance $zero) but list the amount of the debt at separation especially if you are going to be requesting an offset for paying off this community debt.\n\nIf you need further assistance filling out the forms seek a local attorney to represent you or go to the Family Law Facilitator if you cannot afford attorney and they can assist you in preparing the forms but they cannot provide you with legal advice.\n\nIf you find this information helpful, please let the attorney know by marking best answer. Thank you."

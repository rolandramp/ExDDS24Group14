        "The answers posted are all correct, however, there is a lot more to this question than I believe the answers you received really indicate. First, as has been stated, in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy, there is no mechanism for \"stripping\" a lien from your primary residence. In a Chapter 13, if the mortgage is secured only by your primary residence, then you may strip it, but only if it is entirely unsecured. Your loan, as you indicate, is secured by some equity in the home, and accordingly, the Chapter 13 lien stripping may not be available.\n\nWhere the prior answers left you a little short are two areas, both of which require further and more expanded review and discussion than can be accomplished in this forum. First, unless you reaffirm at debt in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy, your personal liability for the loan is discharged. In other words, with your first and second mortgages, assuming you can retain the property in the bankruptcy, your personal obligation to repay those loans is discharged. That being said, obviously if you don't pay the loan payment, they are going to foreclose the property and take it back from you. There is a very interesting issue, however, with second mortgages and underwater properties. In some instances, it may make sense to continuing paying the first, not pay the second (post-chapter 7 discharge), and then attempt to make a deal on the second mortgage. Again, this is a complex scenario, so I would suggest you speak with an experienced, and qualified attorney in your area.\n\nAs for Chapter 13, you need a thorough review of the second mortgage. If it is secured by more than just your primary residence (cross-collateralized), then it may be capable of partial stripping in a Chapter 13, even if a portion of the loan is protected by equity. Again, this is a complex discussion you would need to have with an experienced bankruptcy attorney.\n\n*Due to the limitations of the Avvo Forums, The Gibbs Law Firm, APC's (the \"Firm\") participation in responding to questions posted herein does not constitute legal advice, nor legal representation of the person or entity posting a question.

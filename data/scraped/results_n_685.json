    "title": "How can I protect my bank assets (which is little) if I am scared of a creditor levy?",
    "question": "I received a threat from a creditor that they will dispute my debt legally...I didn't call or contact them, but not sure if they really will proceed with their threat. I am scared to use my bank account or to put any money in it for the house expenses or my personal ones since I am not working anymore, and can't work either. Do the bank usually will inform me if they received a levy against me? And can I open a new account to use it by the mean time? Also, is a bankruptcy can help me out with these debts? I appreciate your answers ...thank u",

        "If there is a judgment against you then yes, a creditor can levy your bank account to enforce their judgment against you. My clients tend to find out about their bank levy when they try to withdraw funds or make a purchase and come to find out their bank account is frozen. You want to look into your options before that happens. Bankruptcy can prevent levies and can wipe out most judgment debts. I recommend you speak with a bankruptcy attorney.",
        "I agree with Ms. Expada in that no creditor can attach bank assets without a judgment. In addition, it may also have tbeen stated that whether you can retain the funds if you file bankrutpcy depends on whether those funds can be exempted in California not knowing the state of California's exemption in which the state has opted out of the Federal Exemption scheme. For this you should contact a qualified attorney.",
        "You need to meet with a local bankruptcy attorney to determine if a BK makes sense for you; because it will more than \"help you out\" with your debts - it will eliminate them.\nIf the creditor is threatening, that means they don't have a court judgment against you yet and your accounts are safe.",
        "Has the creditor sued you and gotten a judgment? If not, then there's no way for the creditor to levy your ban account. Be sure to check court records in the county where you live to see if you were sued. If you were sued, contact a debt collection defense attorney in your area to discuss your options. If you were not sued, then there's no reason to worry about a bank levy, at least not yet.\n\nBankruptcy may be an option for you, if you have a lot of unsecured debt (credit cards, medical debt, etc.) and your current income is not enough to repay the debt. Find a bankruptcy attorney here on Avvo.com, and schedule a consultation."

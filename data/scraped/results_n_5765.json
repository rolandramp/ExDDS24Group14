    "question": "Basically, I have a situation where I am in a chapter 7 bankruptcy. I have a car loan and a credit card with my Credit Union. In the past, they told me that I will never get my car title until I pay off the credit card because the loans are cross-collateralized. Now that I am in chapter 7 bankruptcy, can they still do that? I would be fine with reaffirming on the car but certainly don't want to pay the credit card. I don't care if they kick me out of the C.U. I just don't want to keep the car if it means I have to pay on the CC too.",

        "If you reaffirm the car but not the credit card then you are obligated on the car debt alone and the bankruptcy discarges the credit card obligation. If the creditor refuses to agree to allow you to reaffirm the car unless and until you reaffirm the credit card debt (which they can do) then you would have to reaffirm both to keep the car. I would advise to let both obligations be discarged but stay current on the car and attempt to refinance with a different lender after the bankruptcy is over or let the credit union have the car and buy a new one after the bankruptcy.",
        "If your loan agreements allow for cross collateralization, then you are probably struck with both or neither loan. You might want to consider redemption, where you pay the value of the car in full and walk from the rest. www.722redemption.com is one place that can finance the value of the car.",
        "In my experience, CUs don't generally try this anymore unless the car is worth more than what is owed on it. They would probably be OK with you reaffirming the fair market value of the car; but, depending on what it's worth as compared to what you owe on the auto loan, you may choose to surrender it rather than pay that much more for it.",
        "Your Chapter 7 bankruptcy will not affect the credit union's right to cross collateralize your debts to them. You may wish to speak with a manager about trying to reach an agreement to resolve this matter, but many times you have to be willing to surrender the vehicle & buy something to replace it financed with someone else. Hope this perspective helps!"

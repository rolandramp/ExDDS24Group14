        "It seems like you represented yourself at trial and lost. Because you represented yourself, you probably didn't make the objections that you needed to make in order to keep the false/inaccurate facts from coming into evidence.

        "A proper review of your case and your situation requires a review of all of the relevant documents and the entire case file. As far as the case that you lost, did you plead, and then prove, as an affirmative defense that the Statute of Limitations had run before the lawsuit was filed against you? As far as the \"debt relief agency\" is concerned, did it communicate with the creditor and make a promise that you would make a payment? If so, that might extend the SOL.

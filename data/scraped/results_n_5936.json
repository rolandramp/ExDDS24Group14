    "question": "I never filled out FL-150 because I was under the impression that I didn't need to, since I'm not asking for any spousal support or for him to pay any fees and vice versa. So I don't know what to put in boxes 2 and 3 since I never served him with an income and expense declaration.",

        "Accord with my prior two colleagues. Everybody in every divorce or legal separation case in California is required to include a completed Income and Expense Declaration in his/her Declaration(s) of Disclosure. No exceptions are allowed.",
        "I agree with the previous answer. You need to prepare your Preliminary/Final Declaration of Disclosure (which includes the Income and Expense Declaration as well as the Schedule of Assets and Debts). You can prepare a Preliminary Declaration of Disclosure and waive the Final Declaration of Disclosure in your Judgment or prepare one combined disclosure document. The Disclosure documents need to be served on the opposing party. You then need to file a Declaration regarding service of the Declaration of Disclosure (FL-141) with the Court.\n\nGood luck.",
        "You have to complete, file, and serve one, without exception. Regardless of if you are NOT asking for any financial support. You have to do it as part of your declarations of disclosure."

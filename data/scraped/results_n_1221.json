    "title": "Should I wait the 7 years for the bad debt to fall off my credit score or should I file for Bankruptcy?",
    "question": "I have just over $30,000 in credit card debt that I haven't paid in over a year and a half. Just recently gone through a divorce and can't afford to make payments. All my credit cards have been closed off and sold off to collection agencies. I have a great stable job. I want to start rebuilding my credit score. I fear that if I wait the 7 years for these credit cards to fall off my credit score, they may come after my income. So far, I've only been getting calls from collection companies and not been answering. I've heard bankruptcy stays on your credit for 7 years - so it makes me think I should just wait for the bad debt to fall off my credit.",

        "A credit score is just a number a means to an end. Other factors like your goals and assets should be analyzed too. The statute of limitations for a written debt is 4 years so collection agencies will try to sue by the third year. If they win a lawsuit they can start garnishing your wages. Defending one such lawsuit is expensive often more than a bankruptcy filing.\n\nA bankruptcy has a negative impact on your score but will stop credit card companies from garnishing your wages.\n\nIf you have not paid large amounts of debts in a year and cannot pay it in the future you should consider bankruptcy. Only a bankruptcy attorney can look at your financial situation and goals and give you advice on whether and when to file.",
        "The statute of limitations (SOL) for written contracts (eg. credit card agreements) in California is four years. That is, generally creditors can wait up to four years before passing the statute of limitations on filing a lawsuit. Creditors often wait until the final year of the statutory period, then sue the debtor or sell the right to collect the debt to a collection company who will sue the debtor, before SOL date. If a judgment is obtained, liens, levies or wage garnishments may be implemented. Judgments last 10 years, and can be renewed over and over again.\n\nFor those who qualify for a Chapter 7 Bankruptcy, most debts will be discharged by Order of Discharge in the Federal Bankruptcy Court. This means the debtor's personal liability for debts has been discharged.\nOften debtors begin receiving credit offers almost immediately upon receiving a discharge. New car loans are frequently given by lenders because they know the former debtor no longer has any other debts and can not receive another bankruptcy discharge until well after the term of the automobile sale agreement has ended. Many people purchase houses less than three years after their bankruptcy.",
        "While Avvo is a wonderful resource, it is no substitute for a face-to-face consult with an attorney when it comes to giving legal advise. In fact, I believe that most attorneys have disclaimers like I do that we give general information and not legal advise. There are many factors that influence a decision, and especially assets that are owned, which your question doesn't even begin to address.\n\nLet me supplement the excellent responses by the other attorneys by putting something in perspective--a bankruptcy filing can actually IMPROVE a debtor's credit situation. Not right away, as your credit score will take a major hit, but if you are not looking to buy a house or car what difference will the score make? And, your credit has been thoroughly trashed already by 18 months of defaults, possible charge offs, etc.\n\nIn the days before the finance crash of 2008, the rule of thumb was that a person would be able to get a new mortgage in about 2 years after a bankruptcy discharge. Then...banks stopped lending, even to people with good credit scores. Now, things are moving back to \"normal\". A car loan--right away, not necessarily with a good interest rate.\n\nA person with a bankruptcy discharge is in a better position to get credit than one without. After a bkc, a new creditor does not have to worry about \"competing\" to get your money, meaning, they do not have to worry that another creditor will garnish your wages or a bank account such that you can not make your payment to the new creditor. The new creditor would also have comfort knowing that you could not file another bankruptcy for years. The wait time for a Chapter 7 after a previous Chapter 7 is 8 years.\n\nCompare that scenario to trying to get through 7 years. You have \"only\" 5.5 years to go. Looking over your shoulder. Waiting for the knock on the door at 6am from a process server. Possibly having a final judgment entered against you, which, by the way, stays on your credit report for 10 years, the same as a BKC filing.\n\nI do not want to come across as a snake-oil salesman, and me being in Florida there is no way that you could retain me to provide BKC representation, so my words here, which by the way mirror those of my colleagues from CA, are meant to put things in perspective for you to consider.\n\nOne last consideration. You were recently divorced. Always a tough situation--emotionally, financially, life-style changes, etc.. Financial distress is a major contributor to marital distress. Let's say you do find some one else with whom to share your life with. Do you think that your having clean credit would make that transition simpler or more difficult to deal with? And with that, I feel just about close to being a snake-oil salesman, but even so, I believe that consideration is a valid one to be taken into account.\n\nGood luck to you, getting over the divorce as well as your making your decision regarding our debt situation.",
        "I concur with the answers given by my esteemed colleagues and add the following: BK is not a DIY project. The assistance of a competent and experienced BK lawyer will help you successfully navigate the legal minefield which lays before you. Because you have a stable job, at least some of your creditors are likely to file lawsuits against you seeking a court judgment that you owe them money. Attorney fees, costs and interest will be added to the judgment amount which then can result in your wages being garnished. A bankruptcy petition can successfully discharge your unsecured debts and most if not all of your assets may be exempted. Your fresh start is recognized by many creditors as an opportunity for them the extend new credit to you, allowing you to rebuild your credit quicker. Some of us offer a free consultation by phone or in person. Take us up on it.",
        "Chapter 7 bankruptcy actually stays on your credit report for a period of 10 years. While bankruptcy negatively affects your credit, missed credit payments negatively affect your credit as well. In addition, you may be subject to lawsuit and judgments. It is very difficult to respond to your question without knowing your specific circumstances and all necessary facts. There is no substitute for a full consultation from a local bankruptcy attorney. I strongly suggest that get such consultation. Most attorneys provide some type of a free initial consultation.",
        "Bankruptcy can stay on your credit for 10 years. That said you can file bankruptcy and rebuild fairly good credit in just a matter of a few years. Chances are somebody's going to sue you on that $30,000 you owe. You're probably better off filing a chapter 7 or 13 bankruptcy to deal with the debt. You'll end up spending less and building good credit sooner.",
        "A bankruptcy may stay on your credit report for several years, but its much better than being deeply in debt for those years and fearing that a lawsuit will pop up and then you are looking at getting your wages garnished."

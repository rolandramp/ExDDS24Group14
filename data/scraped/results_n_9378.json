    "answers": [
        "Unfortunately, you cannot bring your grandmother to the US with an I-130 (family-based petition) because she does not fit into any of the preference categories or qualify as an immediate relative. The best that I can think of for her to enter the US is with a medical visa, which is very similar to the tourist visa. You can learn more about the process here: www.uscis.gov.\n\nThis correspondence is intended as general information and not as legal advice. Please speak to an experienced immigration attorney for assistance.",
        "I will agree with the previous lawyer. You will want to look into a humanitarian parole.

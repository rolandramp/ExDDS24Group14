    "question": "I had a credit card debt, that I last made a payment on, January 2009. The creditor filed collections suit last year, but did not serve it. Now, several months past the four year statute of limitations, they have moved it to the local court & served it. Is the suit barred by the statute of limitations?",

        "Unfortunately, if a lawsuit is filed with the court before the expiration of the statute of limitations, the lawsuit is within the statute of limitations, regardless of the delay by the plaintiff to serve the lawsuit on the defendant.",
        "The statute of limitations runs from the date of the breach to the date of filing the lawsuit. So, if the lawsuit was filed within 4 years of the breach, but not served within the statute, the lawsuit is not barred. Happens all the time.",
        "The Statute of Limitations is satisfied if the case if filed within the 4 year period. Service of the Complaint can occur after the Statute of Limitations. BK trumps the lawsuit.",
        "It states that allow filing prior to service, such a scenario is common and allowed. So long as the case is opened (filed) at the court before the SOL expires, the case is good and SOL will not be a defense. This practice is particularly common with personal injury cases. The case gets filed to preserve the right to sue (to stay within the SOL), but the complaint may not get served for some time.\n\nThe rules may specify that the complaint must served within a specific period of time after filing.\n\nSorry, I know it is not the answer you were hoping for.",
        "probably not ... it was \"commenced\" timely",
        "I agree with Atty. Whitaker but would also point out that you are appear to be assuming the statute began running Jan. 2009 and ran continuously for the 4 years. The date the statute begins to run, and the calculation of any days the running of the statute may have been \"tolled\", for any number of reasons, is something that is often very difficult to do and isn't as easy as just looking at the perceived \"start\" and \"end\" dates. Still, as counsel has stated, even given those dates, it appears they were within the statute due to having commenced it timely and would probably not be barred."

    "title": "Chapter 7 and Child Care Expenses",
    "question": "I am looking at filing chapter 7 and my single largest expenses is daycare. Anyone that has a child and works full time knows how expensive this can be. Currently, I pay my mom to care for my 1-year old son but I am wondering if this will be scrutinized because she is a family member receiving cash and I am very close to not passing the means test.",
    "answers": [
        "Childcare is a legitimate deduction and is allowed on sch j and the means test. The amount , if reasonable, is rarely scrutinized. The fact that you pay your mother, adds a wrinkle to the issue. As long as you have proof via checks, money orders or a supplemental affidavit you should be ok.",
        "You will need to prove what you pay mom, by taking cancelled checks to the 341 hearing. To be safe, before you meet with your BK attorney, take with you price sheets from at least two daycare facilities in your area. Good luck.",
        "So long as money is actually changing hands and has been for a while, you should be fine. Generally, child care expenses are rarely scrutinized unless the amount is out of whack (e.g. $3000 a month for a 16 month old).",
        "Hello,\n\nAs long as you are actually paying your mom, and it is reasonable and necessary for you to pay for childcare, this expense should be one you can include. I hope this info helps. If you have any other questions, feel free to contact my office. www.NewChapterLaw.com\n\nThank you!",

        "Since this was part of the MSA, you can file a contempt motion or an Order to Show Cause (OSC) in the family court as this was part of the judgment. A Contempt motion may be difficult if your MSA did not detail how it would be paid. The OSC would allow the court to detail the repayment.\n\nIt is possible that the Small Claims Court may decline jurisdiction as the Family Court established jurisdiction over this debt.",
        "If your MSA was incorporated into a judgment then your sister may already be a judgment creditor and there is no need to sue. The least expensive way is to make a written demand. If he does not respond then a writ of execution can be sought to attach his wages, property etc.",
        "Have your sister sue him in the Court that allows for the least cost effective complaint. (Many Courts have jurisdictional limits, so suing in City Court in NY limits the recovery to $5,000.00). She has a very good case because there is a judicial order where the ex has admitted liability, both factual and legal."

    "title": "If you have medical, can the government take away your property after you pass away?",
    "question": "My mother was receiving medical after she was diagnosed with breastcancer. She passed away a few weeks ago. My father (legally married to my mother) found a letter from medical mentioning that after she passes away, the government will take her property. My father, my mother and I have property together. Is this information true? How will this affect my father and I with the property if my mother didn\"t leave a will. What do you recommend we do?",
    "answers": [
        "As Mr. Wayson indicated, the state can seek recovery of Medi-Cal from your mother's estate. However, the state generally will not require property to be sold if there is a surviving spouse, which there is in your case. The state may impose a lien on the property to be paid when your father dies. There are also exceptions to recovery where the decdent's heirs/beneficiaries are disabled or qualify for a harship waiver. You will need to notify the California Department of Health Services of the death and provide a copy of the death certificate. They will then advise you of your rights and their procedures.",
        "Sorry about your recent loss. Actually, yes under federally funded programs through the Medicaid program, state Medicaid Estate Recovery programs, enable states to recoup public spending for Medicaid long-term care recipients from the estates of those recipients after their death.\n\nThe 1965 Medicaid law gave states permission to impose liens on property in the estates of deceased Medicaid recipients. Post-death liens prevent the estate from being settled and the property distributed to the recipient’s heirs before all claims against it, including Medicaid’s, are satisfied. Congress included a provision in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA ‘93) that required states to implement a Medicaid estate recovery program.\n\nOBRA ‘93 requires states to recover, at a minimum, all property and assets that pass from a deceased person to his or her heirs under state probate law, which governs both property conveyed by will and property of persons who die intestate. A state’s ability to recover from probate estates depends in some measure on Medicaid’s standing vis-í -vis other claimants. The order of payment of debt is established under state law. Mortgages, unpaid tax or public utility bills, child support arrears, burial costs, or other debts may be paid before the Medicaid lien and reduce the amount that is actually recovered. The State’s standing is also influenced by locally determined state priorities. For example, some state laws protect the family home in an estate from some or all claims against it, including Medicaid claims.\n\nA local elder law or public benefits attorney would be able to review the specific facts of your situation and advise you on how to proceed, contact your local or state bar association for a referral to such an attorney."

        "The question cannot be answered without an examination of more facts. A general chapter 7 discharge will not effect a discharge of a student loan or similar debt as described in section 523(a)(8). However, such a debt may be discharged upon a showing of undue hardship. In order to obtain such a discharge, it is necessary to file a complaint in the chapter 7 case and make an appropriate fact showing. If your case has been closed, your attorney can seek to have the case reopened in order to file the complaint. FIrst, however, they will conduct an analysis of your situation to determine whether there is a reasonable prospect of the court finding that the your circumstances are so dire that the debt places an untterly unmanageable burden on you. More probably, the debt will not be dischargeable. Your best bet is to figure out how you might be able to pay the obligation over time, and seek a workout with the school. This is also the course of action most likley to give you timely access to your school records.",
        "There is plenty of case law that says the exceptions in 523 are to be construed narrowly and you are not just granted the status.

        "What you are calling a tuition balance may in fact be dischargeable in your bankruptcy because it may not be a student loan. However, that is not a sure thing. What you have is a dispute with the school and in order to resolve it, you may either need to go to court or convince the school otherwise. It may not be worth the effort because as said here, you need to pay the school to get access to your transcripts, etc.",
        "I disagree with their assertion that such a balance is automatically non-dischargable. First, 11 USC 523(a)(8) deals with student loans guaranteed by the government or for money advanced for an \"educational benefit,\" scholarship, or stipend. Just because they are a non-profit does not mean their tuition is non-dischargable - if they didn't advance you money (like a stipend or scholarship or student loan) to pay the tuirion, then my position is that it IS dischargable - it's a debt owed just like any other. Just because it's to a school doesn't make it holy. Further, if they didn't challenge it via an adversary complaint in the core bankruptcy, their argument is much less compelling. So, I'm not so sure you owe it. Check with your bankruptcy attorney. As for the records, that is a common issue that arises, and I've not had any luck forcing educational institutions to turn over educational records when they aren't paid - they aren't required to do so (it's like a lien on some property - just because you don't owe the debt doesn't mean the lien is erased).",

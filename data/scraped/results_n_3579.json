    "title": "A law firm in Sac brought a wage garnishment against my husband's wages. Apparently debt was mine, but i have no job or income.",
    "question": "The law firm is representing PRECISION RECOVERY ANALYTICS, INC for a claim of $8800. We don't remember ever getting original papers from them in 2011. This COMPANY is out of business. No records at all on internet. The Law Firm in NY has many cases against them. Nelson & Kennard Law Firm still filed this and is taking 25% of my husband's salalry...leaving us less than a $1000 a paycheck (bi-weekly) . Our house payment alone is $1560. plus utilities, car ins, FOOD, $450 a month in payments, etc. We can't do it. We filed a CLAIM OF EXEMPTION and have a hearing on 5/20/2014. Please help. The NY lawyer said to contact someone in CA. about Precision and I was given this website. I am 61 & my husband is 71. We can't live on them taking 25% of his paycheck & my UI is out. We need advice.",

        "Precision Recovery Analytics is a debt buyer. It sounds like this debt buyer, represented by Nelson and Kennard, filed a lawsuit against your husband, and obtained a judgment.\n\nIn order to have obtained this judgment it was required that Precision Analytics give notice of the lawsuit by delivering a summons and a copy of the complaint. (That is called \"service\" of the summons and complaint.) If your husband was never served with the summons and complaint, he may have grounds to \"set aside\" or \"vacate\" the default judgment.\n\nYour claim of exemption may be granted, but it also may be denied. You should explore all of your options in dealing with that judgment. Filing a bankruptcy case would be another option.\n\nUse the \"Find A Lawyer\" section of this website to look for a debt collection defense/consumer attorney. You should try to locate someone who practices in the geographical area where the lawsuit was filed.",
        "I suggest you retain a lawyer in your area that handles debtor/creditor relations.\n\nNelson & Kennard do have a reputation of mass filing of collection suits against persons they claimed they served with lawsuits. Just a quick glance around indicates there are more than a few people who have said the same thing you're saying. They found out that this law firm has a judgment because their wages have been garnished.\n\nIf they did not effectuate proper service of process on you then the judgment is void and must be set aside. You do that by filing a motion to vacate and set aside the judgment. If the judgment is set aside and vacated then the garnishment is no longer valid.\n\nAnd if they obtained a judgment and garnishment on non-existent service of process, that may lead to a much more lucrative claim on your part against them for wrongfully garnishing your husband's wages. I might also point out that its entirely possible the claim against you may have lapsed due to the statute of limitations, but that is something that a lawyer would have to analyze.\n\nI cannot say that you were or were not sued or served properly; but it appears that this is something that's a chronic problem with that firm with others. Either they are using the wrong process servers, or they are not properly serving, or someone is lying about obtaining service on you.\n\nThere is at least one reported decision where they have been sued as a law firm. So its possible.\n\nIf in fact this is their M.O. then eventually the Attorney General's Office will get involved and shut them down. Over ten years ago there was a law firm called 'The Trevor Law Group'. They sued thousands of auto repair shops throughout California and eventually got shut down themselves.\n\nWhenever you have an assembly-line law firm suing thousands of people a year, there is inevitably going to be some corner-cutting going on, for instance not properly serving defendants, or in some cases, moving for default and damages by simply filing a motion without service on anybody.\n\nAnother case out of Florida involved robo-signing by another lawyer, David J. Stern. Again assembly lines were formed and robo-signing took place. Employees swore to anything to get the case through the system and to a successful foreclosure. Stern was eventually sued out of business by the Attorney General of Florida and ended up disbarred over it.\n\nSo again, you need to contact a lawyer in your area.

        "You should go speak with a local attorney regarding your situation. I see your post is from Napa. If you live in Napa County, Bay Area Legal Aid runs a consumer debtor's rights clinic that help families that are in the situation you are in. The clinic is in American Canyon at the Sparkpoint Center located at 3423 Broadway, Suite D1 American Canyon, CA 94503. You do have to RSVP and you can do so at (707) 980-7024. The next clinic is Saturday May 10th so I would RSVP ASAP.\n\nIf you have not already done so you when you talk with your local attorney or the people at the Legal Aid Clinic, it will be helpful for you to bring 1) Your Claim of Exemption that you filed, 2) the Notice of hearing on the Wage Garnishment, 3) the Judgment that was issued against you, 4) the Proof of Service of Summons on file for the Complaint against you and 5) The Summons and Complaint that was filed against you. Also your attorney/advocate is going to need know a general picture of your financial situation, so be prepared to answer questions about current monthly income, other bills you have to pay, and any other debt or lawsuits that you might have going on. You should have items 1 and 2 already but items 3-5 you can get from the Court where the case was filed at. If the case came out of Napa County, go to the records department of the civil division located at 825 Brown Street in Napa. Give the clerk the case number that appears on the wage garnishment, and the clerk should be able to help you print out the documents mention. Copies of these documents will cost .50 cents per page, but ask the court clerk for a fee waiver and see if you qualify for the fee waiver to get free copying of the documents.\n\nDepending on your situation and after review of your documents, your exemption may be granted or denied. Any expense you claimed on your Claim of Exemption, you should have receipts and statements documenting those expenses ready to show the judge and the creditor. You may also be able to work out an agreement with the creditor to an agreed amount that can be garnished or even try to work out a lump sum payment plan to dispose of the debt entirely. It will just depend on what is factually going on and your attorney or advocate can walk you through some of the options that might be available.\n\nI hope this helps. Again try to sit down with someone and get the documentation above as this will help out your advocate. Spending some time in a confidential consultation with an attorney will be worth your while.",
        "When you go to court, you may win. But you may also lose, which means that .

    "title": "Buying defunct business that state suspended",
    "question": "I have a question about possibly assuming the debt/buying a prior company. The original owner cannot be contacted and the business was suspended by the state in 2005. The suspension has since been lifted, but the corporation is not active. How would it be possible to take the companies name and be able to assume their debts and contracts? What kind of attorney would one seek for this?",

        "Given these limited facts, I believe it is most important for you to locate a competent business attorney experienced in business sales and acquisitions to provide you detailed advice on the inherent risks of acquiring an existing business. In most cases when you purchase an existing business (which is different from purchasing the assets of the business), you become a successor to the debts and liabilities of that business. For that reason, most business sales are handled through the bulk sale provisions of the California Uniform Commercial Code.",
        "The \"suspension has been lifted\". You appear to be saying someone who would presumably be the shareholder has reinstated the Corporation but has not as yet activated its business. To answer your question would involve a legal analysis of the specific factors involved including what it is your trying to achieve. To give an answer based upon what you have stated, you may and likely will be misled. Obtain and discuss the entirety of you matter with a knowledgeable business attorney.",
        "Once the company is suspended by the FTB or SOS its name is up for grabs. However, that's just its name - not its contracts, assets or liabilities. Therefore, you cannot take the name and assume the contractual liabilities without completing a novation, which is a complete substitution of your new company for that of the prior company of the same name. You will need to work with a business attorney and get in touch with the owner of the defunct business, as well as the other contractual party(ies).",
        "You need a business attorney. Youand need to enter into a buy-sell agreement ams revive the corporation by filing the proper paperwork and paying any fees.\n\nA full consultation would be necessary to properly advise you."

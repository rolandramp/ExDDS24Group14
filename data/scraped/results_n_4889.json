    "title": "What are the consequences of tuition debt being transferred to collection agency.",
    "question": "Apart from having a very poor credit score, are there any other consequences related if my outstanding tuition from a public university. I intend on my paying all my debt back after I get paid at the end of this month. However, the university decided to send my file to the collection agency. I am currently working out of the country.",

        "I agree with both respective answers below and would highly recommend speaking to an attorney in your area. From my experience, the university will eventually file a lawsuit against your for the tuition amount or more which will cause you to incur more fees. A settlement may be very possible but you can also keep bankruptcy in mind if you are eligible for it because this fortunately does not sound like a student loan debt which is quite difficult to discharge through bankruptcy while our understanding is that tuition debt should be discharged.",
        "I agree with the previous answer. The collection company could elect to sue you for the debt if you are not proactive. You should probably consult with an attorney in your area to find out what your options are- including whether negotiating a settlement is possible. Even though you are out of the country a telephone consultation with an attorney is possible, as well as calling the debt collector to obtain their physical mailing address so that you can verify the debt.\nFrom a credit reporting standpoint, this is probably taking a toll on your credit score. The original creditor reports student loans to the major credit bureaus, as well as information about your delinquent payment history, past due balance, and they may be reporting the account as a charge off. Also, most people don't have just one loan, so if you have multiple loans, all of them could be reporting in this way. In addition, the collection agency may also be reporting this/these account(s) to the major credit bureaus as collection account(s). Once you have paid these debts off, you can re-evaluate your credit report to make sure all the accounts are actually closed showing a zero balance due so you can start rebuilding good credit. I hope this was helpful!",
        "The collection company will exacerbate the interest on your college tuition. Your tuition debt amount will practically double in the next three years. It is very important that you pay your college tuition debt before it starts accumulating interest. You may be subject to a collection lawsuit and unless the bankruptcy laws change, it is very difficult to write off these debts. Generally, the collection company gives you thirty days to answer their letter. You may consult with a consumer attorney to help you. There are a couple of things that can be done, such as asking for a Bill of Particulars. This will ascertain that you owe the actual debt. All total you can get around 45 to sixty days before they lower the boom on you. Enough time to pay your entire debt. Best of luck."

    "title": "How do we remove something that should not be on my husbands credit report?",
    "question": "I filed bankruptcy, under the guidance of an attorney, 5 years ago. We had a business credit card with a balance that had my husbands name of it. It was not included in the discharge but our attorney said they could not try to collect because we are married. The balance has been sold to 2 collection agencies. We tried to contact them several times and have forwarded a letter to them that they are not allowed to pursue collection or negative reporting on my husband credit because of my bankruptcy filing. They report it every week. We stopped trying to contact them as we were once told after 4 years it has to be dismissed. I don't know if that is true. We don't know what we are allowed to do to get the negative reporting removed and rectified.",

        "Well, let's first get clear on the facts. You filed bankruptcy without your husband and received a discharge of debts under 11 USC 727 or 1328, correct?\n\nThe debt on which you are complaining is in your husband's name alone, correct?\n\nAssuming your case was a Chapter 7 case and no assets were disbursed by the Trustee, then the community discharge of 11 USC 524 prevents the creditor from collecting against any community property assets.\n\nIf your case was a Chapter 13 case, or a Chapter 7 case in which assets were disbursed, then that creditor would have needed to be listed in your bankruptcy schedules and notice given to that creditor in order for the community discharge to apply.\n\nHowever, this does NOT prevent the creditor from filing lawsuit against your husband or seeking collection against any separate property assets your husband may have, or reporting negatives on his credit report if he has defaulted on the payments.",
        "It IS included in the discharge ... it's called the community property discharge.\n\nOnce you notified the debt buyer and / or debt collector that you and your husband were and are still married, and that the debt was incurred pre-petition, the debt buyer's or debt collector's actions are violations of the discharge injunction.\n\nIf the attorney you used for the bankruptcy case is not interested or is not available, you may hire someone else to pursue damages against the debt collector, and perhaps to obtain an order that the debt collector must refrain from reporting.\n\nYou may have damages under the Bankruptcy Code and also the California Consumer Credit Reporting Agencies Act.",
        "Your attorney can assist in stopping attempts to collect discharged debt and recovery of damages for violation of discharge order."

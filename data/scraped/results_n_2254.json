    "title": "Do my parking tickets stay with me, after my car has been impounded and the impound lot sells my car?",
    "question": "I have over 25 outstanding parking violation tickets from several different cities in California. My car was recently impounded in San Francisco because I parked without paying. I have decided to let the impound lot sell my car so I don't have to pay the impound fees, but I am not sure what happens to the parking ticket fees after the car is sold?",
    "answers": [
        "The parking tickets become your responsibility after 72 days. In the first 72 days, it belongs to the registered owner of the car (whoever that may be); after that, it is the person who was the registered owner when the ticket was issued.",
        "The parking ticket is issued to the car, not the driver. If you are the registered owner of the car, these are your debts.\n\nIf a parking ticket remains unpaid for 72 days, it gets reported by the municipality to the DMV. If that happens, the DMV can refuse to issue registration on a different car until you pay the back ticket fines and associated fees.\n\nThe municipality also has the option of sending the debt to a collection agency.\n\nIf the car is sold at auction, the tow company will first take its stowing charge. If there is anything left, it will be applied to the unpaid ticket debt, and the DMV notified that some of the debt has been paid."

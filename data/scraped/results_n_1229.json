        "You are confused about what each does and there really isn't any \"strength\" issue here or water tightness here. In a Legal Separation, all issues are decided just like a divorce except for the fact that you are still married. In a Legal Separation you will still need to decide how to divide the community property assets, affirm each other's separate property, decide support issues and any and all child custody/visitation/support issues. Again, you will still be legally married to your spouse but you will have done everything that a divorce would required. A divorce does all of the above plus it terminates the marriage. A Legal Separation Agreement is final as to division of all assets and debts and support issues just like a divorce.",
        "While the Legal Separation action is still open you can convert (amend) it to a Dissolution Petition. But once the Judgment is entered, you will have to file a new action to actually dissolve the marriage. After a Legal Separation Judgment you are still married.",
        "No. Legal separation not as strong as divorce. Divorce has finality not included in legal separation.\nLegal separation cannot be \"converted\" to divorce. New petition for dissolution of marriage will be necessary to move from legal separation to dissolution.\nYes. CS remains modifiable.",
        "I think you are confused. You can get either a judgment of legal separation, or a judgment of divorce. There is no conversion.\n\nIf you reach a settlement and submit it as part of a judgment, no second thoughts will alter what has been submitted."

    "question": "I have over $30,000 in credit card debt (which I have previously settled and have started 5-7 year payment plans. Unfortunately, due to a mental illness for the past 6 mths I was careless with bills, spending, etc. Past 3 mths been getting treatment and trying to pick up the pieces.. I went from $5,000 a month (before taxes) to collecting NDI disability from work ($250 a week). Before,I was always just breaking even each month. Now I am very far behind in finances and cant afford to live in CA anymore and moving to FL to live with a relative. The creditors are not willing to put me back on the payment plan and are harassing me to pay the full amounts in full. I do not have property, furniture, etc. I have $150 in my bank acct. I am moving to FL w/out a job. Do u advise Chapter 7?",

        "I agree with the answer above except you do not have to wait 180 days to file your Chapter 7 in Florida. You can either file it here in CA or FL if you have resided in FL for the greater part of the last 180 days. That means you have to be in FL for 91 days not the 180 days as indicated above.\n\nLEGAL DISCLAIMER\nMr. Larkin is licensed to practice law in CA and is located in San Diego. His response here does not constitute legal advice and does not create an attorney/ client relationship. The response is in the form of legal education and is intended to provide general information about the matter in question. Many times the questioner may leave out details which would make the reply unsuitable. Mr. Larkin strongly advises the questioner to confer with an attorney in their own state to acquire more information about the specifics of their case.",
        "Once you move to Florida and have been here for at least 180 days you should be able to file a chapter 7 in the State of Florida. As long as you have not filed for a chapter 7 in the last 8 years or a chapter 13 in the last 4 years. Based on the information that you have provided it would seem that you would pass the means test. This chapter 7 will discharge all of your unsecured debt and any secured debt in which you are surrendering the property. The only debts you will not be able to discharge would be taxes, child support, alimony, student loans, etc. I believe it would be more beneficial to file for a chapter 7 and get a clean slate then try to continue to negociate with the credit card companies."

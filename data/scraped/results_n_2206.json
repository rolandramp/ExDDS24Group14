        "As usual. atty Waddell's advice is spot on. I would add that you sound like you are \"judgment proof\" meaning that even if you are sued and get a judgment against you, the creditor would likely be unable to collect anything from you. If you have a job, your wages are exposed to levy. Even then, there are a number of moves you can take to defeat a wage levy: File a claim of exemption for 100% exemption of your wages; the creditor could challenge this because medical care is considered a \"necessity\" in the eyes of the court so you might be able to only exempt 95% of your wages; If you have a bank account, keep a very low balance, or better yet, open another account with a credit union or other small local bank. If you do make a payment arrangement with the creditor, don't pay them with a personal check. Instead get a money order at the post office or local 7-11. If all else fails, you can eliminate the debt in BK. But, BK is not a DIY project. Find/hire/consult an Avvo BK lawyer by clicking the tab \"Find a Lawyer\". Many of us offer free case analysis and free consultation.\nGood luck to you.",
        "If you owe the money, and can't pay on the terms indicated by your agreement, the doctor (or the collection agency he either hires or sells the debt to) can sue you. If they sue you and obtain a judgment against you, they will be able to enforce that judgment through a variety of means, including garnishing your paycheck when you obtain employment, garnishing your bank account, and others. You have rights in that collection process, but won't necessarily be able to stop it completely. The only way to stop them from suing you, other than working out an voluntary arrangement with them, is to file for bankruptcy. If you think you need bankruptcy, your best option is to set up one or more consultations with local bankruptcy attorneys. Most offer free consultations, so you have a risk-free way to see all of your options. Best of luck to you."

    "title": "Can a bail bond agreement be discharged in a personal bankruptcy?",
    "question": "A family member co-signed a bond agreement for an ex who failed to appear. They have not yet started making payments on the 8% downpayment ($4,800) the accrued fees for trying to locate this person (approximately $2,000), and they will ultimately be on the hook for the total bail amount ($60,000) if the ex isn't found within four months. The family member is 22, unemployed (right now), and realistically will never get out from under this crushing debt. Is it permissible for this person to file bankruptcy to discharge these debts?",
    "answers": [
        "I agree with my esteemed colleagues that have answered thus far. Barring any property that was secured or fraud the bail bond is dischargeable in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy.",
        "Yes, the family member who co-signed can have the debt discharged in a bankruptcy.",
        "I agree with most of the prior answers. Discharge starts with the concept that \"everything\" is dischargeable unless specifically excepted from discharge. There is nothing in the Bankruptcy Code that makes this particular type of debt \"nondischargeable\".\n\nHowever, as was noted, if there was collateral pledged for the debt, at least in chapter 7, the bankruptcy court has no ability to remove this type of lien. Under very limited circumstances, lien \"stripping\" is possible in chapter 13.\n\nYou need to seek advice from an experienced bankruptcy attorney to determine whether bankruptcy is a good option or not. It very well could be the best option, but no one can advise that without a thorough review of the entire circumstances of the person seeking relief.",
        "Yes, the debt is dischargeable, but any security given as collateral is at risk since the security agreement survives the BK.",
        "As other counsel indicated the personal liability for the bail bond should be dischargable absent other factors (fraud, false financial statement etc) If there was security for the bond, that security would remain, So if FM gave the bail bond a deed of trust on his residence, that deed of trust would still be enforceable. Other factors come into play at that point.\nHave FM at least talk to an experienced bankruptcy attorney to make sure there are no issues regarding either the bail bond or other matters.",
        "Yes. It is dischargeable though as my colleague noted, if the creditor/bond agent took a security interest in the debtor's property, that security interest will survive the bankruptcy.",
        "Yes. Debt you described is dischargeable in C7 or C13 BK.\nIf bond secured by real property, personal liability will be eliminated by BK. However, security interest of creditors will survive BK discharge.\nI have handled several bond forfeiture BK discharges under similar circumstances.\nConsult BK counsel.",
        "I am changing this to bankruptcy, but I can't see how the book bond industry could survive if this was dischargeable."

    "question": "I do no business under the CA LLC but people owe money to it. I would like to collect it someday but don't want to keep paying $1,600 a year in CA taxes just to keep that option open. I want to merge it into my NV LLC. How do I do that?",
    "answers": [
        "There are several ways of preserving the ability to collect from your company's debtors. I am not sure merging the two companies is necessarily the best option. One simple way is to have the new company buy the debts owed to your CA company. This would require a simple purchase and sale agreement between the new company and the CA LLC. You can set the purchase price at whatever value you think is reasonable. Make sure you understand the tax implications of doing this."

    "title": "Am I responsible for my mom's ambulance bill and hospital bill after her death?",
    "question": "She had $20,000.00 in a checking account. She had me as a joint owner so that it could be split between my brother and me after she died. There is no probate, no estate, and I was named executor. We split the money, using a lot of it to take care of final arrangements. Am I obligated to pay the $1,000 dollars remaining on her hospital balance and the $150 ambulance bill?",

    "answers": [
        "Normally, only the estate has to pay the bill, not the heirs. However, since you were a joint account holder, and that account was part of the estate, you must pay the bill.",
        "If there was no probate, I am confused by your statement that you named as executor. Executors are named by a court as part of the probate process. Unless you signed a contract agreeing to pay, only assets of a probate estate are responsible for paying medical debt. Hope this perspective helps."

If this is the case, a Creditor has continued to collect upon a debt that was discharged in Bankruptcy, which would be a violation of your rights. You should investigate whether money or property was taken from your wages or financial accounts after you filed the Bankruptcy, then discuss this situation with a qualified Bankruptcy Attorney in your area. If the money was taken after you filed Bankruptcy, a telephone call to the Creditor would most likely result in a refund check coming to you along with additional fees for the Attorney making the call.

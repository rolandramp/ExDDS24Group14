    "title": "I received a summons from Midland Funding for a credit card bill they say they bought from Citibank for $1500 . How do I respond",
    "question": "to the summons? They never contacted me and they only sent the summons, nothing proving that it's actually a legitimate bill. It just says I owe money for a credit card and show only the last 4 digits of an account. I need to respond and I need to do this pro per so any help would be greatly appreciated. Do I file the general denial from http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/pld050.pdf ? I'm a little confused because it say it the amount needs to be under 1,000 but my summons says 1594.00 Thanks",

    "title": "When a previous tenant files Chapter 13, does it wipe out monies owed to a landlord agreed to right before eviction court?",
    "question": "Hello, I started an eviction on a tenant who failed to pay rent. Right before the hearing, we agreed on about $7,000 and paying me a certain amount per month. Now that he's out and I'm cleaning and repairing damage, he'll owe me more money for the cleaning and repairs plus rent from the time period from the prior eviction court date til the time I get the property re-rented (he broke his lease). So, I have 1) an agreed upon amount of about $7,000 and 2) another amount of approximately $4,000 I'll have to win in small claims court for cleaning, damages, and addtl. rent loss. Does the filing of Chapter 13 (court date on 4/20/2015) wipe out what he owes me?",

        "I concur with the advice offered by my colleagues. You're not dead, but you are on \"life support\". As a creditor, you will get notice from the BK court, a copy of the Plan, and an invitation to file a claim. If a Plan is confirmed by the court, you will receive a \"dividend\" from the Chapter 13 trustee based on a percentage of your allowed claim ONLY if you file a proper claim. A verbal agreement to pay $7K is problematic. Better to submit evidence of the cost to repair/rehab the place. Good luck.",
        "The other attorneys are correct. The filing does not wipe it out. If the debtor completes the plan (3-5 years usually) then the debt could be discharged. To assert the amount owed to you you would need to file a proof of claim in his case. Depending on what percentage, if any, of his chapter 13 plan amount goes to unsecured creditors you may be paid all that you are owed per your proof of claim; a percentage (1-99%); or nothing at all if he proposes a 0% plan and that plan is confirmed. You also have the right to file an objection to confirmation. Seek the assistance of an experienced BK attorney to guide you on what your options are.",
        "You will need to file a claim as a creditor in his Chapter 13, and you may receive a dividend from the plan. The Discharge of debt is entered at the end of the plan, 3 to 5 years later. Any unpaid balance on claims would be wiped out at that time. If the case is dismissed before that, then you can resume collection. You may want to sit down with a creditor's rights attorney to review the case and assess any objections you may be able to file in the bankruptcy case.",
        "Attorney Roach is correct. Filing a Chapter 13 doesn't automatically wipe out the debt, but it does institute an automatic stay which stops you from being able to collect. You must immediately cease all collection efforts outside of bankruptcy court, including any actions in small claims court. It would be a good idea to consult with and hire counsel that can talk you through your options, which may include an action for nondischargeability (if your facts support such a case), filing a proof of claim, and other potential actions. In addition, it is not uncommon for Chapter 13 cases to be dismissed prior to a discharge being entered, and if that happens, you can resume your collection efforts. I hope that gets you pointed in the right direction.",
        "You can submit your Proof of Claim into the debtor's bankruptcy case and the trustee will distribute the plan payments to the allowed claims.",
        "All of the prior answers are right on point. The only thing I would like to add is that if you believe any of the damage that you are planning to repair was willfully and maliciously caused by the tenant, then it is possible to argue the amount of the repair costs should be non-dischargeable. For example, it is not uncommon for some tenants to rip out all of the plumbing and/or electrical fixtures before vacating. If something like that is the case, then you should consult with a local bankruptcy attorney before doing anything else including making any of the repairs. You might need to take photographs or do other things to properly document the damage. If on the other hand the \"damage\" you are referring to is more in the nature of ordinary wear & tear, or something that could be viewed as accidental damage, then the repair costs would not be non-dischargeable.",

        "The filing alone will not wipe it out. People file those all the time and never follow through and they get dismissed. In order to wipe you out, the debtor must get a discharge.\n\nI am changing your category to Bankruptcy."

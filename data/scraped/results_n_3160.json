        "I agree with Attorney Fetzko, you shouldn't have any problem opening up a new bank account at Chase, post-bankruptcy. You do not need to mention your past accounts or financial history, however, if they ask you about your financial history you should tell them the truth. Every creditor has different criteria for determining whether to do business with you. If Chase declines your request for a new account, take your business elsewhere. I recommend consulting with an attorney or visiting www.dattalawgroup.com for more information regarding your question.",
        "If you closed the bank account with zero balance and the credit card was not an overdraft account, then you shouldn't face any problems.\n\nIf you owed the bank a balance at the time you filed Chapter 7, you may be prohibited from opening a new bank account due to \"Check Systems\" which banks use to track customers who have not paid their overdrafts. If this happens, you can try sending a copy of your discharge order to Check Systems and request that you be taken off their list.",
        "There are many banks which will open a checking account for someone in your situation. It looks like you might be overthinking this. I would simply visit the bank and inform the New Accounts manager that you want to open a checking account. If they ask you about any previous accounts there, answer them honestly. If they decline to accept your business, go somewhere else. Many times small local banks looking for new business are more accomodating. Lastly, you don't have a \"right\" to deal with a particular bank. Good luck.",
        "Only Chase will be able to tell you whether you can open a new checking account. Every creditor has different criteria for determining whether to do business with you. I think you should give it a try. The worst that can happen is that they don't let you open an account. I don't think you need to tell them anything other than you want to open a checking account. If you are asked directly if you ever had a Chase account before you can tell them you did have an account. I doubt you will be asked why your account was closed. Your bankruptcy is a matter of public record and will be on your credit report so it isn't a secret. If you are asked if you ever filed a bankruptcy you should answer truthfully.",
        "You should have no problem opening up a bank account at Chase post-bankruptcy. You need not mention your past accounts or the fact that you filed for bankruptcy. Quite frankly, if Chase gives you any difficulty in opening a bank account because of your financial history, you ought to take your business elsewhere."

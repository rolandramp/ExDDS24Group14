        "Yes, you're entitled to half the \"community\" value of that asset. Community value may accrue from the date of marriage until the \"date of separation.\" This is a somewhat technical issue. You can look up answers about dividing a pension or 401k online, either via this site, or via Google. Or, hire a local family law lawyer for a consult.",
        "You need to consult an experienced local family law/divorce attorney. Since you have only been married three years, I doubt you are looking at taking half of his pension and depending on the facts of the case you may or may not have a claim for any of the funds. Get in touch with an attorney to fully explore the options and fully assess the relevant facts here.",
        "Unfortunately, it is not as simple as how long you were married that is considered. Family courts typically try to split any assets and debts from the marriage as equally as possible between the two parties. For a better idea of what the split could look like, I would recommend speaking with a local attorney."

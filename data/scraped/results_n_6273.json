    "title": "I received a summons from American Express Centurion Bank. How do I answer?",
    "question": "How do I answer their summons for my credit card debt? I called American Express to work out a plan and they said they sold the debt to a debt collection company. The American Express account number on the summons for my credit card debt only shows the last 6 digits and the rest are x'ed out. Are they supposed to show the entire account number? Am I really being sued by American Express or is this a debt collector pretending to be American Express?",

        "Is this a lawsuit? Are you required to file papers with the court by a certain period of time? If so, you need to file a responsive pleading with the court within the time stated on the summons for the credit card debt.\n\nNo. The complaint does not usually contain an account number. If you read the complaint it should explain whether the suit was assigned to the plaintiff by American Express.",

        "None of us is familiar with the facts concerning the Creditor’s objection to the confirmation of your chapter 13 plan. Although you mentioned that the dispute concerns a real estate, this does not tell us much. Your attorney is in the best position to respond to your questions. Generally, in the Northern District of California, the parties’ attorneys need to meet and confer two weeks before the confirmation hearing and file a joint pre-hearing statement with the Court one week before the confirmation hearing. From my own experience, most disputes are being settled during the meet and confer process. If there are any legal disputes that need to be adjudicated, than the Court may decide these disputes based on attorney’s argument only. If there are factual disputes, the Court may schedule an evidentiary hearing on the objection, in order to allow the parties an opportunity to present evidence concerning the factual disputes. Evidentiary hearing is typically being scheduled by the Court, not by the parties.\nI strongly suggest that you discuss your concerns with your attorney.",
        "The purpose of an evidentiary hearing is to present evidence in the form of documentation, testimony, and demonstrative exhibits that are relevant to the factual matters before the court. The court will ultimately prepare an order that will include \"findings of fact\" and related \"conclusions of law.\" Because law does not mean much in the abstract, the bankruptcy court must first determine the facts that are relevant to the legal issue before the court.",
        "Your attorney is correct.\nPurpose of evidentiary hearing is to allow both parties to present evidence to court, argue, receive court rulings and appropriate orders.\nAnswers to other questions you state depend on facts not provided.\nYou attorney in best position to answer questions you present.",
        "Disclaimer - I do not practice in your district but an explanation of possible 'disputes' on the confirmation are usually brought either by the creditors, who in our district must file a written Objection to Confirmation, or in some cases if they believe their debt is not categorized correctly, file an Adversary (i.e. they believe fraud was involved in the Debtors part when the debt was obtained and the debt is classified as unsecured non priority), or the Trustee can object for reasons that the Debtor has not complied with all of the requirements of a Chapter 13 Debtor, the plan is not proposed in good faith (does not pay all disposable income to the plan) and other reasons; and the Court, also has the duty to make sure the plan complies with the code even if the Trustee and creditors do not object.\nThe 341a and documents required before the 341a allow the Trustee to request the documents necessary for the trustee to perform his/her duty to make sure the correct exemptions and values are used, and the secured creditors are treated properly. In the Central District the Debtors are required to make post petition per confirmation payments in a certain form of payment and provide proof of delivery of the payment, we actually have a form that is filed with copies of the payment and proof of mailing."

        "I agree with my colleagues. Unfortunately when you co-signed you became liable as well for the entire balance, so the credit card company can go after you, or him, or the both of you. You can discharge your liability in a bankruptcy, assuming you qualifying and it is determined to be a good option for you.",
        "I agree with Mr. Firth. There is nothing that you can do to force him to pay this debt. You can sue him in a third party action if the credit card company sues you but realistically even if you prevail, the likelihood of collecting on the judgment against him are quite low. I never recommend anyone ever cosign for any debt unless they are fully capable to pay for, and prepared to be fully responsible for, the debt. The other way to get out from under this debt would be to file a bankruptcy and discharge your personal liability for the debt.",
        "When you co-signed on the credit card, the two of you entered into \"joint and several\" liability which means that both of you are obligated to pay the entire debt and the credit card company doesn't care which one of you does it. Short of suing your ex-boyfriend for the bills he ran up on the card and now won't pay, there is not much that you can do. Your only way to get off personal liability is to file bankruptcy. I suggest that you consult with a bankruptcy lawyer in your area to see if that is a viable option. Most offer free initial consultations."

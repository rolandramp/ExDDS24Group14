    "question": "So, I owe 200k on my mortgage. Owe the HERO program $50 for repairs made to the house. It either stays on the property tax bill (transfers as an expensive encumbrance to new buyers) or needs paid off at sale. If house is worth $350k, can I argue that I only have $100k in equity?",

        "I agree with my esteemed colleagues insofar as relates to the liability of the HERO program. Whether you are entitled to 100k in homestead exemption is another matter. More is needed to be able to answer.",
        "I had a client with one of these once. We listed it as an encumbrance and reduced the equity accordingly. The bankruptcy sailed right through. HEROs work just like loans in that the new buyer has to pay it off at sale, so it reduces you equity accordingly.",
        "I agree with the prior responses that the HERO $50k is added to the other encumbrances on the property. However, keep in mind that you may be able to argue you have less equity than you think. Most of the judges in the CA Central District bankruptcy courts allow you to also deduct from the calculation of fair market value an amount representing the costs of a hypothetical sale of the property. Typically the amount used is 8%. Therefore, if the fair market value of your house is in fact $350K, you can subtract 8% ($28,000.), then subtract the $250k in encumbrances, and you end up with only $72,000 in equity. So, if the house is actually worth a little more than the $350k, you should still be O.K. with the available $100,000 homestead exemption under CCP Sect. 704.730(a)(2).",
        "Your equity is the difference between the value of the property less the encumbrances. If the HERO debt is secured by the property, it is added to the $200K you owe on the first mortgage, resulting in $100K equity. If you live in the property with your spouse or other family member, and are under age 55, your homestead exemption is $100K.

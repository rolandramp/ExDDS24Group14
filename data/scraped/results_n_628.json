        "You are required to file all tax returns for a chapter 7. It would be best to have your returns filed for a chapter 7, however, I have had clients who have not had them filed and their chapter 7 went through so I do not believe it is a necessity in a chapter 7. We do have to provide a copy of your last filed tax return, so if that was six years ago I would provide that. Does your income require you to file a tax return for the past 5 years or has it been below the threshold? If you are below the threshold then you do not need to worry about filing at all and you can file a declaration with the Court stating your income is such that you are not required to file tax returns. Hope this helps.",
        "I am not aware of any rule that states you MUST file those tax returns in a ch 7 case either before or after filing your case (as opposed to a ch 13 case). The rule in the Code simply requires you to provide the trustee your last FILED tax return. If not yet filed, then you use the oldest one in fact filed that is the most recent to comply with that rule.\n\nBut a trustee may keep the case open if they believe you may obtain a tax refund! But if you owe taxes my advice is to file the returns . Now if you file a ch 13, all unfiled tax returns I believe your tax attorney will state are NOT dischargeable because they were not filed and enough time passed by afterwards before the ch 13 case was filed. We do NOT know what amount of money is owed and interest and penalties either. Possibly you can file all returns before the IRS does, wait over 2 years longer later, then see a bankruptcy tax attorney and see if you file bankruptcy are all those years then dischargeable instead of not dischargeable. That is the key issue.\n\nOther facts can affect your case so I will point those out next for you too. You need and want to enjoy your fresh start also. But the most important thing is to meet with an attorney as you asking this question means you have not. You care about 2 goals: keeping everything you have equity in and discharging all your debts. If you don't have any of the exceptions to discharge you will obtain that goal; most exceptions are set forth in 11 USC. 523 (Google it) like child support, some income taxes, traffic (in a ch 7) and criminal fines , and presumption of student loans. But some debts are dischargeable in a ch 13 but NOT in a ch 7 so you want to make sure and your attorney will discuss any such types with you also!\n\nYour exemptions depend on what state you have lived in in the last 2 years and thus if in your state, then your states exemptions will apply. Most persons filing keep everything they own but your attorney will confirm that with you when they learn everything you own and the equity thereof!\n\nSome secured debts like homes, vehicles, other secured debts an attorney will discuss your options on also as you must list any debts; but that does not mean you will lose them unless you have too much equity or are in default on paying for them! Discuss those options if they apply with your attorney too.\n\nBut other issues can arise that can greatly harm your case. Just one example: If you paid back a relative $3,000 11 months ago and now file bankruptcy next week, the trustee can SUE that relative to retrieve that $3,000 (under what is called a preference) for the benefit of the bankruptcy estate. As a result, most attorneys don't charge to meet with them the first meeting so meet with one no matter what.\n\nMany great attorneys can be found right here on AVVO in your state so look, call, and meet one as soon as you can.\n\nYou should also want to know when to file: is there an advantage of waiting versus filing now and who should you pay between now and then! Good luck and enjoy your later fresh start.",
        "If you were required to file tax returns, then you have to file before your hearing with the bankruptcy trustee. Doesn't mean you have to pay the tax, it just means you have to file the returns. Note however that this tax liability will not be discharged in a chapter 7 bankruptcy. It might be discharged in a chapter 13 and it might make sense to file a chapter 7 to get rid of your dischargeable debt, then file a chapter 13 to pay off your tax liability in an orderly fashion.

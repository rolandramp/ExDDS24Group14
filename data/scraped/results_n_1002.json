    "question": "Chapter 13 Plan",
    "answers": [
        "You may amend as many times as reasonably necessary.\nExcessive amendments may prompt trustee, creditors, court to request dismissal.",
        "As many as you want. However, there are deadlines on obtaining a confirmable plan. Also, each time you file an amendment it may affect the amount of money to be deducted from each paycheck and then some might have to be caught up depending on the changes. But you asking such a question implies you do NOT have an attorney..that is a huge mistake and in a ch 13 huge multiplied by 100! Other issues and facts can govern a case so if you have not yet filed..or if your case is dismissed I will point out as follows some of those next.\n\n\nYou need and want to enjoy your fresh start also. But the most important thing is to meet with an attorney as you asking this question means you have not. You care about 2 goals: keeping everything you have equity in and discharging all your debts. If you don't have any of the exceptions to discharge you will obtain that goal; most exceptions are set forth in 11 USC. 523 (Google it) like child support, some income taxes, traffic (in a ch 7) and criminal fines , and presumption of student loans. But some debts are dischargeable in a ch 13 but NOT in a ch 7 so you want to make sure and your attorney will discuss any such types with you also!\n\nYour exemptions depend on what state you have lived in in the last 2 years and thus if in your state, then your states exemptions will apply. Most persons filing keep everything they own but your attorney will confirm that with you when they learn everything you own and the equity thereof!\n\nSome secured debts like homes, vehicles, other secured debts an attorney will discuss your options on also as you must list any debts; but that does not mean you will lose them unless you have too much equity or are in default on paying for them! Discuss those options if they apply with your attorney too.\n\nBut other issues can arise that can greatly harm your case. Just one example: If you paid back a relative $3,000 11 months ago and now file bankruptcy next week, the trustee can SUE that relative to retrieve that $3,000 (under what is called a preference) for the benefit of the bankruptcy estate. As a result, most attorneys don't charge to meet with them the first meeting so meet with one no matter what.\n\nMany great attorneys can be found right here on AVVO in your state so look, call, and meet one as soon as you can.\n\nYou should also want to know when to file: is there an advantage of waiting versus filing now and who should you pay between now and then! Good luck and enjoy your later fresh start.",
        "Unless the amendment does not adversely effect the creditors, you would need to notice a hearing to confirm each new plan, but there is no limit of amendments, so long as they are in good faith.",
        "You can amend as many times as is reasonably necessary up to the 341 hearing. it sounds as if someone is filing a chapter 13 without the assistance of an attorney. If so, there is a high probability that the filer won't even get to the confirmation hearing. Too many things can and will go wrong..",
        "I am not aware of any particular number of times you can amend your case. As pointed out by my colleagues, multiple amendments suggest a lack of experience with the process. US Trustees office studies confirm virtually all non-lawyer assisted Chapter 13's are dismissed. If you don't have a lawyer, big mistake.",
        "The confirmation hearing can be continued or delayed if the debtor hasn't submitted a viable plan. And plans can be amended or modified both before and after confirmation occurs. I have seen cases where plan 21 was the one that was confirmed. I hate to have to work that hard, but I will if I have to. Hope this perspective helps!"

        "The Form Interrogatories includes a request for the other party's Schedule of Assets and Debts. Check the box, provide a blank form, and you will receive an updated Schedule of Assets and Debts, along with all the attachments it requires (assuming it is completed properly). In my practice, having a properly completed Schedule of Assets and Debts informs the way I choose to litigate a case.

Be prepared.\n\nDon't simply propound discovery without having a well-thought out rationale in place which guides your discovery plan. Good luck to you.",

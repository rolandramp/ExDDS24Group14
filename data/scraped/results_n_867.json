    "title": "What motions remain after a ch BK is dismissed?",
    "question": "I had filed a CH 7 BK in 2010. In an adversary proceeding one creditor got an order that stated their claim is non dischargable in this case as well as in any other BK I may file in the future regardless of the Chapter. This Ch 7 was soon dismissed without discharge. In 2011 I filed a new (not converted) Ch 13 where the rules are a little different. The judge in the Ch 13 case disallowed the claim of the particular creditor that I said had the non dischargable order from the Ch 7. Now after 5 years of completing all of my payments and getting a discharge last month, this creditor is going after me basing their justification as the order from the dismissed Ch 7. I thought any motion or ruling of a dismissed case would be invalid or vacated since I as the debtor got no relief or advantage from that action, and a creditor should not either. Simply put, what happens to orders created in a case that was ultimately dismissed??",

        "The order of nondischargeability of the debt in the Chapter 7 case is valid despite the subsequent dismissal of the case. (11 U.S.C. 349). You don't state under what grounds the original objection to discharge was brought. I'm guessing that it was brought under 523(a)(6) (willful or malicious injury, but NOT personal injury) or (15) (certain types of debts arising from divorce) because those can be discharged in a Chapter 13.",
        "An adversary proceeding is separate from a bankruptcy so the non-dischargeability judgment would still stand as valid. But, in the 13, if the claim was disallowed, you may be able to get some relief. You would have to reopen the 13 and do a complaint to determine dischargeability and somehow try to around the validity of the previous order. Also, the Ch.13 discharge still takes care of some non-dischargeable debt such as 523(a)(6).",
        "The order in the adversary proceeding stands separate from your dismissed 2010 bankruptcy. Adversary Proceedings are related to the main bankruptcy case and also separate from the main bankruptcy case. Courts will dismiss bankruptcy cases where a motion is pending, such as a Motion for Relief from Stay, and the Court will enter an order on the Motion after the bankruptcy is dismissed. It is a good idea to obtain a copy of the docket in your bankruptcy case.\nThe adversary judgment affects every bankruptcy you file. In a Chapter 13 it is added to the total amount of your unsecured debt, unless the creditor files a lien against your real property, which may make you ineligible to file a Chapter 13. As of April 1, 2016, the limits for secured debts (mortgages and liens) are $1,184,200, and unsecured debts are limited to a total of $394,725. If the judgment increases the amounts of your debts to over the limits allowed by Chapter 13 then you may be forced to file a Chapter 11 or not at all.\nIf you have not made any payments on the debt since 2010, and/or made very limited payments, then the creditor may be willing to negotiate a settlement.",
        "The judicial finding of debt being non-dischargeable is a valid order. The underlying Chapter 7 may have been dismissed, but the finding of non-dischargeability remains. Your Discharge in the 13 has no effect on the this debt.\nI am not sure why the debt was not partially paid during your 13."

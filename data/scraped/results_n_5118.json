        "As stated by the other responses if you are receiving Social Security Disability or applying for this benefit, then there is no means test applied. However, for SSI benefits you can have up to $2,000.00 in liquid assets or $3,000.00 if married. Liquid assets include a savings account and or IRA. The only account that would not be counted would be a dedicted trust fund account. Please contact Social Security or a local attorney for further assistance. Good luck to you.",
        "I agree with my colleagues. if SSI - $2000. If SSDI - you can have any amount including IRA's, savings, retirement funds, etc.",
        "To echo my colleague's answer, you generally can only have about $2000 of assets and still qualify for Supplemental Security Income, which gives you immediate access to Medicaid. That number goes up to $3000 for married couples. However, if you are applying for Social Security Disability Insurance, then you have no income limitations.",
        "Social Security is an insurance program for which workers pay premiums in the form of payroll taxes. Social Security benefits are not affected by other aspects of a beneficiary's financial fortunes. Social Security is commonly confused with Supplemental Security Income (SSI)--even by attorneys who should know better. It is a means-tested welfare program for people of low income and little in assets. To add to the confusion, both programs serve the elderly and disabled, and both are managed by the Social Security Administration.\n\nFor Social Security benefits, there is no limit on the amount of IRA or saving accounts a beneficiary may have. For SSI benefits, the limit is about $2,000.\n\nBest wishes for a favorable outcome, and please remember to designate a best answer."

        "I've never filed a Bankruptcy case involving only $4k. Seems like an amount that should be managed to ve settled for a couple of thousand. Has the statue of limitation expired? Arw there other debts? What assets do you have? What is your disposable income? Are you being sued? All questions you can discuss at a consultation.",
        "You might consider consulting with a bankruptcy attorney who can do an exemption analysis to see if you have assets that are at risk of this creditor putting a lien or levying on those assets. S/He can contact the creditor and let them know they will lose out if they force you into bankruptcy. I have found that if a bankruptcy attorney speaks to the creditor, that can get a quick \"reality check.\" IMHO unless you are on a fixed income, filing a bankruptcy over a $4,000 debt is probably overkill.",
        "Maybe. Do you have any other debts that you can potentially include?\n\nYou can potentially hire a bankruptcy law firm and ask that they reach out to the creditor to see if they will be willing to settle the debt through the law firm. It could potentially push the creditor to settle the debt or they will take a distribution from under the bankruptcy case (which could be nothing).\n\nMost law firms should be willing to send out such a letter. Best case scenario, if you don't really want to file bankruptcy, then this may incentivize the creditor to settle with you. Worst case scenario, if the creditor does not want to settle (even if the bankruptcy law firm reached out to them), you can simply file a bankruptcy case.",
        "Yes, bankruptcy appears to be your best option. To properly answer your questions and address your concerns, the best way to handle this is with an in person consultation with an experienced CA bankruptcy attorney. Use AVVO's Find a Lawyer tool to select a qualified attorney. Good luck. THIS IS NOT LEGAL ADVICE! YOU NEED TO SPEAK TO AN ATTORNEY WHO IS LICENSED IN YOUR STATE FOR LEGAL ADVICE. This is merely suggestions for you to think about in discussing your situation with the local attorney.",
        "I would not recommend BK if that is your only debt.\nIf you have other dischargeable debts as well, then contact a local BK attorrney for a free phone consultation.",
        "Consult with a bankruptcy attorney in your area. Most offer a free consultation.",
        "If you cannot afford to pay back this medical debt and other debts you have then bankruptcy may be the best option for you. Bankruptcy stops most collection lawsuits rather immediately and wipes out the underlying debt associated with most collection lawsuits along with most other debts you may have. I strongly suggest you consult a bankruptcy attorney so you know your options and the process involved in getting a \"Fresh Start\"."

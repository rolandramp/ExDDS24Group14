        "I agree with the above answers, however, I would urge you to meet with and to speak directly with a bankruptcy attorney prior to pursuing this course of action. There are some issues that have the possibility of resulting in big trouble for you if done for the wrong purpose, done at the wrong time and/or done wrong. You need to lay out all of your facts to the attorney and get a firm understanding of implications of what you are seeking to accomplish.",
        "If you do a refi for a new loan with just your name on it then that loan would be solely your responsibility. If then you file chapter 7 bankruptcy, then you would end up discharging that auto loan in your case assuming you did not do a reaffirmation agreement. However, even if you discharge the auto loan, the vehicle lien survives bankruptcy and if you still wanted to keep the vehicle you would have to remain current on all payments. Otherwise, they would likely repo the vehicle.\n\nOn the other hand, if you signed a reaffirmation agreement, then you would be signing a post petition contract meaning the debt would not be discharged in your bankruptcy case. The reaffirmation agreement is usually the same terms that you had on the prior auto loan.\n\nWhether you should file a chapter 7 bankruptcy and whether you should sign a reaffirmation agreement requires the guidance of a professional. I recommend you contact a bankruptcy lawyer to better assist you.",
        "If the loan is only in your name when you file chapter 7 then, assuming you do not sign a reaffirmation agreement, your personal liability will be discharged from that loan. Your wife will not be personally liable either if you already refinanced the loan into your name only. If you do not remain current on the payments the lender will be able to repossess the vehicle and sell it to satisfy any loan balance."

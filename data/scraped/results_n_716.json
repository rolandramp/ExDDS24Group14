    "title": "California MEANS TEST Question RE: 401K withdrawals before filing Chapter 7",
    "question": "Are 401K withdrawals considered income under the Means Test in California? Total withdrawals of $5,000- $6000 each for the last 6 months but the money in the 401K is now all gone. Do these amounts have to be included in Means Test? (Will not pass Means Test if they were to be included as income). No other income for at least the last 8 months since losing job. All money was used to pay for living expenses. :(",
    "answers": [
        "First, as a technical matter of law, I would state any earned interest or portion of an employers contribution to such 401k could be deemed income, otherwise it would not be part of the test. Why? Because if for example you earned $2000 and put in 401k , then withdrew within 6 months and filed bankruptcy would you use $4000 ($2000 earned and $2000 withdrawn)? No. You only earned $2000! Otherwise, I agree with the other answers already provided!\n\nSecond, other issues and facts can gravely affect your case and you asking that question implies you have not spoken to an experienced CA Bankruptcy attorney and that is a big mistake so I will point out some of those issues now so you realize such mistake in not discussing in person with such an attorney.\n\nYou need and want to enjoy your fresh start also. But the most important thing is to meet with an attorney as you asking this question means you have not. You care about 2 goals: keeping everything you have equity in and discharging all your debts. If you don't have any of the exceptions to discharge you will obtain that goal; most exceptions are set forth in 11 USC. 523 (Google it) like child support, some income taxes, traffic (in a ch 7) and criminal fines , and presumption of student loans. But some debts are dischargeable in a ch 13 but NOT in a ch 7 so you want to make sure and your attorney will discuss any such types with you also!\n\nYour exemptions depend on what state you have lived in in the last 2 years and thus if in your state, then your states exemptions will apply. Most persons filing keep everything they own but your attorney will confirm that with you when they learn everything you own and the equity thereof!\n\nSome secured debts like homes, vehicles, other secured debts an attorney will discuss your options on also as you must list any debts; but that does not mean you will lose them unless you have too much equity or are in default on paying for them! Discuss those options if they apply with your attorney too.\n\nBut other issues can arise that can greatly harm your case. Just one example: If you paid back a relative $3,000 11 months ago and now file bankruptcy next week, the trustee can SUE that relative to retrieve that $3,000 (under what is called a preference) for the benefit of the bankruptcy estate. As a result, most attorneys don't charge to meet with them the first meeting so meet with one no matter what.\n\nMany great attorneys can be found right here on AVVO in your state so look, call, and meet one as soon as you can.\n\nYou should also want to know when to file: is there an advantage of waiting versus filing now and who should you pay between now and then! Good luck and enjoy your later fresh start.",

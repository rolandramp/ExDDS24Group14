    "title": "What is the likelihood that my ex-wife can extend alimony payments if she makes only min. wage or she has no job?",
    "question": "Though she is trying, she cannot get work beyond minimum wage though she is highly educated and a skilled professional and has made good money before our marriage. She has received a GRAVON warning and the final agreement does state that the court has jurisdiction to extend support if a request is submitted to the court. Marriage lasted 8 years and spousal support is schedule to terminate in 2017. I have never missed a payment. She pays close to zero in shared costs for our child - school (preschool), summer camp, other school related costs, as well as most health care cost such as insurance incl. dental and vision, prescriptions and doctor visits. She just has not been successful anything better than min. wage or/and consistent.",

        "There are numerous factors to be considered by the Court (see Family Code Section 4320, including \"Any other factors the court determines are just and equitable) and duration of the marriage is only one of the fourteen factors. Based solely upon the facts you have provided I would speculate support would not be extended given her education and the duration of the marriage. With the termination date two or so years in the future the factors affecting spousal support can change drastically.",
        "It is highly unlikely. Not a long term marriage, and the judgment indicates that it is set to terminate in 2017. Does that mean she won't try to get it extended? She can try, but if she does, get yourself a good family law attorney.",
        "Is 2017 four years of payments? Typically where the marriage are not long-term marriages the court are more inclined to terminate support, even if the supported spouse is not working. This is not to say the court might not extend it. I have seen a court phase is out - make an order for another year at half the original sum and then for six months at a quarter of the sum.\n\nA court will weigh all the factors in the FC 4320 section. Health, assets, debts, incomes, length of marriage, equitable factors, domestic violence, standard of living, ability to pay all play a role. It is very hard to give an idea, without seeing how the court valued this all before."

    "title": "On my chapter 7 filling I stated that I would reaffirm my car loan.I never signed a reaffirmation agreement.Am I liable for it?",
    "question": "If on my bankruptcy paper it was started that I would sign a reaffirmation agreement but I didn't sign a reaffirmation agreement am I still liable for the loan? I voluntary surrendered the car believing I am not liable for the loan (loan is now closed and is being serviced by a different lender). My credit report lists the loan as transferred and not chapter 7.",

        "I suggest you review your online court file at www.pacer.gov . If you are like my clients, you may not remember what you signed. If you & your attorney signed off on your reaffirmation agreement and it was filed with the court, you are stuck with liability for this vehicle loan. If the lender did not offer you a reaffirmation or if your attorney did not sign off on any reaffirmation, unless there is a court order approving the reaffirmation, you discharged your vehicle loan and are off the hook. Hope this perspective helps!",
        "If you did not sign the reaffirmation agreement then you are not personally liable on the loan. In order to have been liable not only would you have had to sign the agreement, but it had to be filed with the bankruptcy court prior to the entry of order of discharge.\nThe lender has taken the automobile and that is all they are entitled to. Should the new servicer pursue the loan they would be in violation of the Bankruptcy Code, assuming the discharge was entered.",
        "If you have received your discharge you did not sign a reaffirmation agreement, the debt was discharged. If the auto was repossessed, then the repossession can be shown on your credit report. In our jurisdiction, any late payments up until the Petition Date (date you filed the bankruptcy petition) can be shown on the report, but other than those two things, the debt and any collection agencies should show that the debt was included in the bankruptcy discharge with a $0.00 balance. I have been told that at least one California judge has held that late payments up to the date of discharge can be shown on the reports.\n\nYou can dispute any proper entries by going to the websites of each bureau ans search for \"how to dispute\".

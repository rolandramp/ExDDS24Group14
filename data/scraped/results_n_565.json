    "question": "The company who bought my school filed for receivership in federal court but we have been assured that our particular program is not closing. However, they have yet to release our refund/stipends from Financial aid after tuition and fees have been paid. My student account has been showing as a credit balance for several weeks. The Dean's have been indicating that it should be released within 24-48 hours for the last week, but still no resolve. Many students including myself are facing past due bills, potential eviction, and not being able to afford to drive to school or our clinical sites.",

        "Believe it or not, most receiverships are assigned to the Bankruptcy Court for administration. You should investigate the Court where the receivership case has been filed, then contact the person who has been appointed receiver for answers as to when the funding will be released. If you do not get what you consider to be adequate answers, then you and several of your classmates can arrange to consult with a Creditor's rights attorney to discuss your options, which may include moving to dissolve the receivership and place the school into an involuntary bankruptcy. However, you need to be careful because this may be one of those situations in which getting your wish may become your worst nightmare. You may get your student financial aid released to you, but the school may be closed down so you can not obtain the scholastic degree you are seeking. Best of Luck to you."

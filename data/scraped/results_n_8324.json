    "title": "Was told to pay restitution can I file Bankruptcy on the amount?",
    "question": "I can only find a job to pay me eight bucks an hour even though I have a college education due to the felony on my record. I was ordered to pay restitution but can not due to lack of funds. Can I include this and probation costs that are way to high as well. By the way I have 8 kids and a sick husband who does work but misses a lot due to his aggressive disease and was given only another year or so before he begins to lose his limbs. Thanks for your help",

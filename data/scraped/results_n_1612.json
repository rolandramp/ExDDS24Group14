    "title": "Bank of America issued a 1099 for discharge of debt to me, but refuses to update credit report as it still shows outstanding?",
    "question": "BofA discharged the debt by sending me a 1099 for $30K back in 2012. However, I cannot purchase a house because they refuse to update the credit report to reflect amount has been discharged and no money owed. They took tax relief by issuing the 1099, but they are still trying to collect the debt. I've contacted the credit repositories (under FCRA guidelines) with proof of the 1099, yet they still refuse to update the credit reporting How can I get this resolved? BofA is the MOST frustrating bank to deal with, and are notorious for mis-reporting items and \"slow playing\" correcting financial issues. Please let me know if there's something I'm missing here. Thank you.",

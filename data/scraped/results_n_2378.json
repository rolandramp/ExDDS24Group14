        "Talk to an experienced bankruptcy attorney about the homestead exemption available to you. There are a number of factors that go into the answer. Transferring the house to another person to avoid a creditor is called a \"fraudulent transfer\" and the creditor in California can look back four years to unwind the transaction. Not a good option for you.",
        "I agree with Mr. Barnes, however, there are much higher exemptions that a homeowner/debtor can claim in his/her house if the person has a homestead exemption. If you have homestead, then you can exempt minimally $75,000 and as high as $175,000, depending on your age, marital and family status, and whether you have any disabilities. You definitely need to speak with a bankruptcy/debtor's attorney who can advise you on how you can best protect your assets without falling afoul of civil and criminal laws on fraudulent transfers. You can find someone under the Find a Lawyer tab. Also, I am reposting this in the Bankruptcy/Debt category so you will get more answers.",
        "If you sued and you lose, the judgment creditor can collect the amount you owe by levying your non-exempt assets and by garnishing your wages. A creditor cannot levy exempt assets.\n\nWhether your home is exempt or non-exempt depends on the amount of equity you have. Equity is determined by subtracting your mortgage balance from the current value of the home. Generally speaking, the first $25,575 of equity is exempt.\n\nIt sounds as though you may have $120,000 in equity in your home. If that is the case, the house is a non-exempt asset, and a judgment creditor can force its sale. Attempt to avoid this by giving a grant deed to someone else is a fraudulent transfer. Not only will the grant deed be subject to a set-aside and the house subject to sale, you may be charged with a crime.\n\nIn order to preserve your home and your other assets in the event you lose this lawsuit, you need to speak with an attorney who specializes in asset protection and bankruptcy planning. There are ways to move assets around that do not violate the fraudulent transfer laws, and the more time you have to do this the more of your assets you can protect. So you should consult with an attorney immediately.",
        "In order to provide you with a complete answer, more information is required. Are you currently paying the total monthly mortgage amount owed? Do you have any arrearage (missed payments)? You state that there is a civil case pending, but it is unclear if you are the plaintiff or defendant, or who the parties are. Thus, my response must be based on an assumption (perhaps in error) that the current litigation is between you and the bank. If the bank has filed to foreclose based upon a default on the mortgage, the can obtain a foreclosure judgment which will put the house up for auction. California law does protect homeowners from any collection for the deficiency between the price obtained at auction and the amount owing on the note. However, unless the amount owing to the bank is redeemed, or there is another basis at the court to obtain relief from the mortgage amount stated, the bank is entitled to foreclose for non-payment. Trying to execute a grant deed to a third party will not resolve the issue, and could create larger headaches down the line.",
        "I agree with the other attorneys that are telling you to see a highly skilled bankruptcy law attorney. Not all the advice here is accurate as reflected by my comment on another attorney's response.\n\nOne of the issues is what the true value of your home is and what is the exact amount of the debt. Your exemption amount is at least $75,000 and may be $100,000 or $175,000 depending on circumstances that other attorneys have described. Even if it is a little over the exempt equity, you may still be able to keep the home if the bankruptcy trustee cannot sell it, pay the mortgage, pay the cost of sale, pay any resulting income tax from the sale, pay you the exempt amount and still have something left to pay off to creditors.\n\nAnother consideration is that, even if your home is exempt now, if the value keeps rising you may end up with more equity than can be protected. You need to take a good look at that situation as it may be that you would be better off filing sooner while the value is lower (assuming we can protect the equity.)\n\nAnother possibility would be to do a Chapter 13 payment plan to pay an amount equal to the equity above your exempt amount.\n\nAlso, if the creditor gets a judgment AND records an Abstract of Judgment at the county recorders, you may have a lien that survives bankruptcy as to the amount over the exemption. Unlike when a trustee looks at all the costs and taxes involved in selling a house, the lien attaches to every cent above the exempt amount.\n\nDo yourself a huge favor and see a quality bankruptcy attorney to find out what can be done for you and what is protected. Your case would be filed in the Bankruptcy Court in Sacramento. I would recommend you find a quality bankruptcy attorney by looking at Avvo's ratings for Sacramento attorneys.\n\nYou could also look at the CA State bar website for a Certified Bankruptcy Law Specialist in Sacramento. Most attorneys will give you are free initial consultation. I have provided a link to the state bar below.\n\nAnother potential source for finding a good attorney would be through a search of the National Association of Consumer Bankruptcy Attorneys (NACBA.org) to find a good local attorney. Again, I have provided a link below.\nThere is a new ratings website that ranks over 70 different \"top rated Sacramento bankruptcy attorneys\" using a number of different criteria. This website leaves a lot to be desired in looks, but it has a sort-able database that gives you 20+/- different options to sort the attorneys based on what you think are the most important. It apparently does not accept advertising from attorneys. I have included the link below.\nNo matter how good an attorney is rated, if you are not comfortable with the attorney when you meet, move on to another attorney. Also, if the attorney uses a paralegal to do the initial appointment, move on because you are just a number and a dollar sign. If this is how you are treated when they are trying to get your money, you can be certain it is not going to get better after they get your money.\n\nDo NOT use an attorney that does anything other than bankruptcy law, foreclosure or debt negotiation. Part-time bankruptcy attorneys are, sadly, almost never expert enough to do the job right. This is a specialized field and you should go with an attorney who practices solely in that specialty. Never hire to veterinarian's assistant to do brain surgery on you and never hire a non-specialist to do a specialists job. Get the right attorney to begin with.\n\nI hope this helps you.",

    "title": "Our small independent church is closing and has IRS and business questions.",
    "question": "Hi. Our church has now only three remaining families and without pastors. We don't own any property. Our remaining fund is less than $15,000.00. Are we liable to other former members that have left our church (for more than a year) if we are to close our church and disburse all our funds to other churches? And should we file with IRS as well? Thanks you.",
    "answers": [
        "1. \"disburse all our funds to other churches?\" You MUST see that any remaining funds go to a nonprofit and since churches are the \"highest level\" (for want of more specific term), giving to churches of most similar belief would probably have the least probability of problems with the Attorney General.\n\n2. You will want to wind up around some date for cessation of business. You need to time that cessation date so that your final tax return will be sent in within the time period due after cessation of business (ie don't wait until the \"usual\" time to file your return as it may be late.\n\n3. Remember that churches may typically have been nonprofits (in many cases) without ever having registered for exemption recognition from the state or federal authorities. In addition, the Attorney General has a register of nonprofits. So, you must ask:\n(1) Was Federal exemption ever applied for and granted? If so you must do a Federal Final return to do many things, including helping to reduce a probability that the feds come back to identify an impropriety.\n(2) Was State exemption ever applied for and granted? If so you must do a State Final return to do many things, including helping to reduce a probability that the state comes back to identify an impropriety. The improprieties identifiable by the state are broader than the Feds and includes consisten exempt purpose AND whether anyone who donated had intended that the money be used for one particular purpose or the other, to the exclusion of certain purposes, etc.\n(3) If you are on the Attorney General's registry, you should consider requesting that your name be withdrawn.\n(4) If you have a corporation (many churches which started much earlier may not have one) you will need to shut it down. (3) and (4) especially are needed so that others don't take advantage of an inactive entity and use it for illicit purposes.\n(5) I would contact everyone with whom you have done business in the past couple of years (caterers, landlords, etc. to make sure that nothing is owing and maybe tell them that you are going out of business. Any donation of the final dollars you make that leave no dollars for anyone pressing a late claim MAY leave some of you officers liable. If you want to be extra careful, if you have an attorney winding you down, or any other entity with a trust, you can time your donations to trigger after some period of time has passed to reduce (or eliminate via statute of limitations if you are willing to leave the money standing long enough) the possibility that someone may show up with palm open and no funds to cover it, with the result that the last few people out the door may be liable.\n(6) There are some california statutes (see California Government Code sec 7231 and 5047.5) which provide that if you can show you have a low budget (not cash in the bank, but low flow through of funds) and obtain an insurance quote that is within a certain percentage of your budget, that there are some indemnity statutes that may work in your favor without your having to purchase insurance. Of course, some E&O insurance may wish to be purchased to hold officers harmless should someone raise their hand as you are putting the organization to bed. This is generally outlined in my article \"NONPROFIT LIABILITY\" written about a year ago. The co-author of the article is an insurance brokerage owner in Anaheim Hills, so she is a broker who is familiar with the article and on quoting E&O insurance. Its all up to a choice to sleep better at night or free up more dollars for donation.\n\nI hope that the church had no employees and paid no one a salary.

        "I agree with Attorney Burbank. Your church's Articles of Incorporation should tell you where the remaining assets should go once the debts are paid. You won't need to file anything with the IRS, but will need to file a certificate of dissolution with the Cal. Secretary of State, and will need to contact the Cal. Attorney General Registry of Charities for a confirmation letter that there are no assets. That letter will need to be provided to the Secretary of State along with the certificate of dissolution. You may want to contact an attorney to help you with this process."

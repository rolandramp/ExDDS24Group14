    "question": "I am a sole proprietor and Architect. I currently hold professional liability insurance. What Is the advantage of switching to an S-Corp here in CA? Is it further protection of my personal assets? If so, how? What other advantages are there? BTW- I have no employees.",

        "Be sure to ask your CPA about state tax. S-corp is taxed at 1.5% and an LLC is taxed at a graduated rate depending on total income, not taxable income.",
        "Very simply, Liability Insurance provides asset protection for the assets owned by your business, minus the applicable deductible. Entity protection (S-Corp; C-Corp; LLC) provides asset protection for your personally- held assets, such as your home, etc. I suggest both types of protection.",
        "OK. I give. What do architects get sued for?",
        "There are 2 primarily reasons small business owners incorporate First, there can be tax advantages to doing business as a corporation. You should consult a CPA to see if there any tax savings you can realize by forming a new entity. The second primary reason is personal asset protection...and attorneys can oversell personal asset protection.\n\nShareholders are generally not liable for the debts of the corporation, but there are exception to the rule. You can waive the asset protection by signing a personal guarantee. Or you can be responsible for your own negligence or other actions. For example, negligently designing a building means that you might be personally responsible for your owner actions, incorporate or not.\n\nAvoid signing personal guarantees if possible and maintain insurance. Those are the best way to keep the personal asset protection.",
        "You really need to speak with a Corporate attorney and work with a CPA/enrolled agent to determine if this switch is best for you. You will have liability protection for your personal assets, if you follow all the corporate formalties. You will also become an employee of the business receiving a W2 each year. The Corporation will become your employer. There are many advantages and disadvantages which are too varied to cover here on this site. You need to consult with an attorney. Many offer free initial consults.",
        "A corporation gives you liability protection that being a sole prop does not.\n\nAs a sole prop (unless you have insurance that covers this) your personal assets can be exposed, whereas for a corporation, that is done properly, your personal assets are not exposed, only the corporate assets.\n\nA full consultation would be necessary to properly advise you.",
        "You get the part that insurance is mandatory in both situations. Forming an S corporation limits your personal liabilities to those invested in the entity, assuming a number of things such as adequate capitalization and payment for shares memorialized in the books and records as well as filing of an exemption from registration of the shares being issued. That being said, it's easily do-able. There are tax advantages that your CPA can explain to you at more length, as well as the comparative advantages between an S corporation and an LLC (assuming your licensing authority permits LLCs.)"

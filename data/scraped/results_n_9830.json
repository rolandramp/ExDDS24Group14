Moreover, there is nothing a poster on an internet message board can do to help you, except to advise you to review your facts and options with attorneys.\n\nRelevant information would include:\nWhat is your immigration status right now?\n\nIf you are in the US, how did you enter the US?\n\nWhat immigration petitions/applications have been filed on your behalf?\n\nDo you have anything in your background that would preclude you from getting legal permanent residency?\n\nWhat is your background? For example, do you have exceptional skills? Are you fabulously rich? Those may be different ways to get immigrant visas to the US.\n\nThere is much more that an attorney would need to know before being able to give you informed advice.",

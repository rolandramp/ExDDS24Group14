        "The IRS generally has 3 years to audit your tax return, counting from the date you filed it. This is the minimum time frame for which you should keep your tax records. In certain cases, however, the IRS is given six years to assess a tax. The six-year statute of limitations on assessment applies to tax returns that omit a substantial amount of gross income (25% or more of gross income reported on the tax return). In light of this exception, I suggest that all the tax records are kept for at least 6 years."

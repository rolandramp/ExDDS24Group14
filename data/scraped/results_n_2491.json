    "title": "What happens when you max out credit cards?",
    "question": "My aunt and uncle recently retired with good credit scores/histories. They owned 2 homes, but after selling one with large equity to pay off their other home during their retirement process, they changed the title of their paid-off home, so their son now is the only one on the title of that home. Both relatives don't have any assets at this moment and are living in their same house that's now owned by their son. They maxed out their credit cards worth of $300K, because my aunt said that it gradually went down the spiral for them as they found themselves striped of money that they used to make when they worked, so they didn't stop spending for a while and basically ended up with tons of debt that they can't pay. Their son helped them with the minimum payments for a few months, but he's no",

        "Please note the correct responses posted by Mr. Daymude and Mr. Chen. Transferring title to a house with a large amount of equity, without any consideration (payment) for that transfer, can be a fraudulent transfer. Since transfer of title is a public record, it will not be a secret from the creditors. The transfer also has the effect of leaving them without a homestead exemption, which would be $175k if either your aunt or uncle are seniors (65 or older). The best course of action at this point is to immediately consult with experienced bankruptcy attorneys to see whether another transfer back to their names is possible, followed by a bankruptcy.\n\nIf a bankruptcy case is not possible then they would eventually be sued. Some credit card companies sue directly and others sell the debt to debt buyers. They would want to hire a consumer attorney to defend each lawsuit and settle them (or get dismissals).

When four years have passed since they defaulted on the credit cards, the statute of limitations will have run, and that will provide a way to avoid any further judgments.",

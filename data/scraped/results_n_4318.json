    "question": "I fell behind in payments for a ridiculously high interest loan with Cashcall, because I was off work for a illness. They emailed and said there's a pending suit against me. They told me to call to make arrangements to pay them. But if the case is pending, I still have to go to court, right? I haven't been served yet. But i looked up the file date, it was 11/4/13.",

        "The fact that you haven't actually received the court papers is not proof that you haven't been served. The Court can authorize a substituted form of service if you have dodged the process server, moved without leaving a forwarding address, or are not typically at home to receive legal papers. Many people have assumed that they have to sign papers or open the door for service to be effective, only to find that a default judgment exists. A suit is only pending until the court signs the paperwork granting a judgment. Hope this perspective helps!",
        "You have to be personally served with the summons and complaint and then you have to answer it within 30 days.",
        "The letter indicates that the company has filed a debt collection lawsuit in a court, most likely the California Superior Court in the county where you live.\nPlease see the short videos on the home page of my website (see below) for a summary of your options once you are served and please review the blog posting that I have on timing, such filing a valid response in court within 30 days after being served with the lawsuit, otherwise a default judgment can be entered.\n\nI recommend that you consult promptly with a debt collection DEFENSE attorney so that a judgment is not entered against you. A judgment would not only harm your credit further, but also be enforcable as a wage garnishment, levy on bank and other financial accounts, and a lien on house and other property.",
        "It means filed but not adjudicated or closed - depending on who you ask."

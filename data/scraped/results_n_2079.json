    "title": "I need to file bankruptcy (chapter 7) for a judgment rendered on me of $84,00 in California.",
    "question": "the judgment was for a vehicular accident i had in 2010, in California. however i live in Colorado now. i moved here almost a year ago. no one died and no alcohol or drugs were involved in the accident. i don't want to put any other major debts in there. how can i go about it?",
    "answers": [
        "Since you now reside in CO, you can file there and the judgment can be discharged in a Chapter 7. You must list all debts you owe and all assets you own in your BK petition and schedules. Omitting a debt or asset is grounds to deny you a discharge. You can reaffirm any other of your debts. Talk to an Avvo atty in your area. BK is not a DIY project.",
        "Problem 1: all debts must be listed when filing bankruptcy - you cannot pick-and-choose among your creditors to include in your case.\n\nProblem 2: if living (domicile/residence) in CO with all assets located in CO, then you must file your case in CO, not California. Using exemptions from CA may still be an option and/or required - you need a lawyer to analyze facts, etc.\n\nProblem 3: if auto accident/judgment was rendered as a result of any alcohol or drug use then according to the Bankruptcy Code (11 USC 101 et seq.) this debt is not dischargeable in a chapter 7 bankruptcy.",
        "Usually when you file a Chapter 7 Petition, all of your debts have to be identified and listed. You may have an ability to reaffirm some of them, but you will only know once you sit down with a bankruptcy attorney and go over all the details. Bankruptcy law is complicated and you should not try it yourself.",
        "Do not omit any debts. No matter what.\n\nIf you fail to list creditors intentionally that is a form a bankruptcy fraud. A creditor or the bankruptcy trustee can make a motion with the Court to deny your discharge for that. It's a federal crime as well. Just is not worth the risk.\n\nAnd because you moved, you have to file the case in Colorado. You need an attorney for this case with the issues you are facing. Don't try to do this alone.",
        "In addition to listing all of your assets on your bankruptcy petition you are required to list all of your creditors as well. The petition is signed under penalty of perjury. So, there may be serious consequences if bankruptcy fraud is proven.",
        "File in Colorado. Use California exemptions. Consult BK counsel regarding which chapter best for you and dischargeability of each individual debt.",
        "I can see from your question that you suffer form a misconception or two about bankruptcy. Please consult with a bankruptcy attorney in Colorado. You will have to file there as it is where you now live, but you will use California exemptions. Best of luck to you."

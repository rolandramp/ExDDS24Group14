    "title": "I keep getting letters from a lawyer/debt collector saying that a judgment has been entered against me for a debt that isnt mine",
    "question": "A laywer is representing a company that has checked my credit and has all my contact details and ssn#. They then have sent letters to my home but to the wrong name. Also I have never owed the creditor who they say I do. What should I do? I have worked very hard to fix my credit and all past credit issues have been fixed or lie outside the statute of limitations... I'm afraid that I will be held responcible for a debt that isn't mine. Can this happen what can I do... especially if a judgment has already been entered.",

        "Disclaimer: The materials provided below are informational and should not be relied upon as legal advice.\n\nAre you positive there is no judgment against you. You can go to the courthouse as Mr. Simons suggests. Alternatively, using the case number you can first check the Los Angeles Superior Court online at the web link provided below. If this judgment is against you, you may inadvertantly make an admission by communicating with the creditor's lawyers. You should immediately consult your own lawyer to protect your legal rights.",
        "This is a most troubling aspect fo debt collection cases. There is no best way to resolve this problem. I advise my clients to send a certified letter (return receipt) to the attorney outlining the facts. Always keep a copy of the letter you send. At the end of the letter request that the attorney confirm in writting that you are not the person that owes the debt and ask that the attorney cease sending correspondence to your address as the person (s)he is looking for does not reside and/or receive mail at that address.\n\nAnother thing to do is go down to the Courthouse and ask to review the Register of Actions. This is on micro-fiche at the Los Angeles Courts and you can research your name. If there is a Judgment against you then you can have the clerk pull the case file so you can see what is in there. If there is a Judgment then consult with an attorney to see what needs to be done. Good Luck\n\nSteven A. Simons, Esq."

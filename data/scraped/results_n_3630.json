        "The only thing I would add the the above, and I think the first answer touched on it a little bit, is that the automatic BK stay will only last about two weeks, and could end even sooner should the landlord obtain relief from the automatic stay. However, if you file Ch. 7 you may be able to discharge the amount owed completely. Nevertheless, your landlord will be able to continue with the eviction process once the automatic stay is lifted.",
        "You really need to hire an excellent bankruptcy attorney of the likes of Ms. Larkin from one of the many attorneys who are active here on Avvo to assist you. Bankruptcy is not a DIY project",
        "You will have to list all debts in your bankruptcy, so if you owe your landlord money at the time you file bankruptcy then you would have to include it. The bankruptcy will stay the proceedings in the state court eviction case, but the landlord can get relief from the stay by filing a motion with the bankruptcy court. The landlord will not be able to collect from you any moneys owing from before the day your bankruptcy was filed, but can recover unpaid rent and other damages accruing since the day the bankruptcy was filed. If you want to stay in your apartment, you can try to work out an arrangement with your landlord, but it will be up to them whether or not they will allow this. You can also file a Chapter 13, if you are eligible to do so, and catch up on the behind rent over time.",
        "All debt must be listed in any bankruptcy. If you owe the landlord money and the time to pay or vacate has ended, then you are Unlawfully Detaining. It will ball be discharged in bankruptcy. Just save your money, fax to the landlord a copy of the bankruptcy schedule when filed so they know you filed bankruptcy and you may end of staying there longer if you still are living on the premises. Good luck and employ a bankruptcy attorney who has experienced in both ch 7s and ch 13'..some are on AVVO. -"

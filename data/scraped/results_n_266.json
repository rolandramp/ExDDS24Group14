    "title": "What does a Chap 7 bankruptcy trustee do regarding fed taxes owed?",
    "question": "For tax year 2016, I owe $12K and I just filed return in 2020. My 2019 income was well below the $12,200 threshold. I have no real assets and I am currently in a Chap 7 bankruptcy petition (discharge date is mid-July). What does the trustee do as it relates to taxes owed to IRS? I have read about \"eighth priority\", but need to know what the process entails once my bankruptcy case is completed.",
    "answers": [
        "I agree with my colleagues above. If 2016 income tax returns were not filed until 2020, they are not dischargeable in the case you recently filed and if the trustee is my administering assets in your case/filed a “No Distribution Report” in your case then the Trustee will not be paying the taxes either. If the trustee is administering assets, you MUST be sure the taxing authorities file claims timely or you file claims for them TIMELY. If the taxes are not getting paid by the BK trustee then you should contact the taxing authorities to make an installment agreement with them OR see if you qualify to be put into “uncollectible status” OR file a Ch 13 BK to obtain a payment plan over a 5 year period.",
        "It is unfortunate that you did not seek bankruptcy advice from an experienced bankruptcy attorney before filing your chapter 7 case. Timing is everything in terms of seeking the discharge of income taxes. With no funds in your case, no payments are available for creditors - had there been, the taxes would be treated and paid prior to other creditors by a chapter 7 Trustee. Once discharge in your case is entered, I recommend communicating with the IRS to advise of your financial situation, and perhaps enter into a payment arrangement.",
        "I agree with colleagues and add:\n2016 taxes are non-dischargeable in cited BK.\nC7 trustee will do nothing in this regard.",
        "If, as you indicate, you have no assets and are simply proceeding to a Chapter 7 discharge that you expect in July, then the appointed Chapter 7 trustee will have no assets to report, will file a report to that effect, and you will proceed directly to discharge.\n\nYour concern that taxes are and eighth priority claim is only a concern in a case where assets exist for liquidation and payment of claims. Where there will be no assets liquidated to pay claims by the Chapter 7 trustee, you need not be concerned with the order of payment.\n\nBecause your 2016 tax return was filed in 2020, the tax claim does not meet the requirement that it be filed for at least 24 months prior to the bankruptcy in order to be dischargeable. Accordingly, the $12,200 is not dischargeable.\n\nYou may want to consider working out a payment plan with the IRS, which generally can be done online without the need for tax counsel or an accountant, provided that the tax debt is less than $50,000.\n\nAlternatively, you could consider Chapter 13, which could be filed immediately upon receiving your Chapter 7 discharge. With unpaid tax debt of approximate $12,200, your monthly payment would be less than $225 per month. If you also include the standard attorney fee for handling a Chapter 13 case and include the full amount in the plan, the plan payment would increase to approximately $318 per month.",
        "The 2016 taxes will not be discharged because because you did not file the 2016 tax return at least two years before you filed your bankruptcy petition. Whether the tax debt remains a priority unsecured debt or just unsecured debt can not be determined on the facts presented. It only really matters if you have non-exempt assets that the trustee can seize to pay your unsecured creditors. See your attorney or a tax resolution expert for details.",
        "The chapter 7 discharge will not affect the 2016 taxes in your situation. Things could have been different if you could have waited a couple of years before filing, or if you had filed the return a couple of years ago.\n\nFor income tax of a particular tax year to be dischargeable, the tax return must be due more than three years before the bankruptcy petition filing date, and the return must be filed more than two years before the petition, Also, any tax assessment would have to be at least 240 days before the filing."

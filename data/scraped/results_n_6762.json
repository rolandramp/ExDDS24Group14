    "question": "He alleged that I have been harassing him by text and phone calls. And found out his whereabouts without him giving me his home address. I have my cell phone records to prove he have called me also,pictures showing us together.I have been invited to his home many of times.I can describe everything in it. I wasn't aware of him being married until the day I went to get my money. Because he changed his number so I went to the home to ask for my money. Do he have grounds for the DV order. And can I sue him for emotional distress for falsely filling this order to cover up his affair",

        "Judges are generally not very sympathetic to people who use restraining orders merely to stop past girlfriends from collecting debts. There are too many abused women and children that need that service. Prove that your contacts were merely to collect the money he owes you, that he was having an affair unknown to you and his wife, and you should not have much of a problem. I doubt that you can sue him for emotional distress though.\n\nI probably would not hire an attorney, but if you do it should be fairly cheap since it is a fairly straight forward hearing. I also would not serve during the hearing, but feel free to have a male buddy serve him the minute he exits the courtroom with your small claims lawsuit.\n\nBest of luck to you.",
        "You must refute the allegations of \"abuse.\" In your case, this will likely include the fact that you have been contacting him solely to collect upon a liquidated debt, as opposed to contacting him for the purposes of harassing him out of spite or malice. He has the burden of proof, albeit a low burden.\n\nDo you have any \"evidence\" of the existence of the debt? Depending on the amount in controversy, you may want to file a claim in Small Claims Court before the DVRO hearing, and then have him served at the hearing, making sure that the judicial officer is made aware of this fact.\n\nPictures and phone records from the past are not necessarily demonstrative of a lack of present “abuse,” and as such, what you need to do is focus on the present. More specifically, what is it that you are doing which is so severe that the court must intervene to protect him, enjoin you for up to 5 years, and potentially destroy your career, economic livelihood, and reputation?\n\nAs for an action of emotional distress in tort, his actions must be extreme, outrageous, and calculated to cause you severe distress. If there is any colorable basis for his DVRO petition, you will not win under this type of theory. Rather, you should hire an attorney to crush his DVRO, and request that he pay your attorney fees.",

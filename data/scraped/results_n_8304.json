    "question": "the collection agency got a hold of me after i did a free credit report on line",
    "answers": [
        "It depends what you mean by \"come after me\". As the other attorney indicated, the collection agency can still ask for payment. However, if the creditor filed a collection lawsuit against you, you could assert the statute of limitations defense and win.",
        "Unless the landlord obtained a judgment for the unpaid rent or you have made a payment within the last three years on this debt, then the debt is no longer enforceable in court, because it is beyond the statute of limitations. Lawyers often refer this at \"time barred.\" You should send the debt collector a letter by certified mail stating that this debt is time barred and you refuse to pay it. See sample letter 1.2 on my web site, in the second link, below.\n\nYour review of your own credit reports has nothing to do with this debt and only you can see on your own copy of the credit report the instances that you have reviewed your credit report, free or not. The credit report that creditors and debt collectors can view does not show your own access of your own credit report. Your own access of your credit report is also not factored into credit scores, which is why consumers should never hesitate to review their your own credit report to ensure it is accurate.",
        "Is there a jusgment against you? If so the period during which they can attempt to collect is greatly increased.\n\nWhen you find out that a judgment has been entered against you, normally by discovering that your wages are being garnished or the bank account has been frozen, you still have a couple of options.\n\nIn most States the Courts allow you to reopen and challenge a “default judgment”. Most States will allow a year to accomplish this. If you did not get the paperwork for the lawsuit, or you got the paperwork but never did anything, then the judgment was “entered” due to your default to file an Answer.\n\nYou have to bring a motion in the Court where the judgment is filed. That motion normally has to include a defense to the charges and a copy of your proposed Answer.\n\nYou should definitely get a local lawyer to help you with this, or seek the assistance of a Bankruptcy attorney to get rid of the liability.

        "Nothing stops them from asking, but they must follow the FDCPA and FCRA as well as applicable California law, so unless they obtained a default judgment you don't know about, asking is about all they can legally do."

        "The short answer is no. The IRS will not intercept a taxpayer's refund to pay a debt owed by a dependent. That's the good news.\nYou should be certain that he is entitled to claim you as a dependent. Study the rules for qualifying relatives. And if he does claim you, he is responsible for your medical insurance, so you need to familiarize yourself with the Obamacare rules. Depending upon income levels, he could be penalized if you do not have insurance.",
        "According to the IRS, a taxpayer may claim a an unrelated person as a dependent if they meet specific dependency requirements. I have attached a link to the IRS interactive tool so that you can determine whether you meet the requirements to be claimed as a dependent.\nThe IRS may intercept a tax refund to offset outstanding federal debt, such as student loans. However, there is no indication that the refund can be offset for debts owed by a dependent borrower. A return filed by a married couple filing jointly can be intercepted, but a spouse who is not responsible for the debt can request a return of a portion of the refund that the injured spouse should be entitled to. Therefore, if a taxpayer is not legally responsible for the debt (co-signer, co-borrower, etc.) a refund should not be intercepted to pay the debt. See tax topic 203 for more details.",

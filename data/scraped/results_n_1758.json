    "title": "Process and timeline after the 120 day waiting period to contest a will and trust?",
    "question": "Under California Probate Code 16061.7, what process takes place after the 120 day waiting period and no beneficiaries contest a will and trust? Does distribution of assets occur immediately or is there an additional waiting period? What are the general processes and timeline by which an attorney would process a distribution after the 120 day waiting period? What would be an attorney's justification to delay disbursement? Sorry to ask in this forum, but we are not receiving any clear information from the trustee.",

        "The distribution process for a trust will vary greatly from case to case depending on the terms of the trust and the complexity of the estate. Generally speaking, the smaller the estate the simpler it is and the quicker funds are distributed, although that is not true in every case. As indicated by a prior post there are many factors that influence distribution. The Trustee needs to collect the assets, pay debts, file and pay any taxes owed, prepare an accounting (if required) and then distribute assets per the terms of the trust. Many factors can delay one or more of duties of the trustee, thus delaying the final distribution.",

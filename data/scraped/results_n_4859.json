        "Yikes! Your divorce should have been finalized a long time ago. Then it most definitely would have been simple. If you and your spouse agree to all of the issues, then you can hire a family law attorney to draft a Stipulated Judgment for you--and it will be easy.\n\nIf you haven't been paying alimony, or spousal support, until now, then there is a good argument against ordering it now. If other party is cohabiting with someone of the opposite sex, then there is also a good argument against awarding spousal support.\n\nIf you bought the home in 2008, I'd guess it's upside down in value. If I'm right, then there isn't any equity to fight over. If there is equity in the house, then yes, it is worth it to hire an experienced family law attorney to assist you. My prediction is that you will ultimately win on the issue, but you've unknowingly complicated things because you, like a lot of people, didn't deal with this issue before now. The longer you wait, the harder it is to unravel things. :) Good luck.",
        "Don't know what you mean by easy. If you don't know what you are doing, then it probably will be difficult to get accomplished. I can't tell from the facts above if spousal support is still an issue. I also don't know if you had gotten a legal separation with a judgment on the distribution of the assets and debts. If not, then this will also need to be addressed. I strongly suggest that you seek the help of an attorney on this matter. My office can help.",
        "You were separated in 1997, therefore, there is almost no chance that you would have to worry about the house you purchased over a decade after separation being part of your divorce. With respect to spousal support, you had a short-term marriage of barely 3 years. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that you will be forced to pay spousal support. However, if your child support order is based on your income from over 15 years ago, when you move to finalize your divorce, there is a very good chance you could end up owing significantly more money than you were originally ordered to pay.\n\nAs for your general question, there is no such thing as a \"easy\" or \"hard\" divorce. Those terms are almost uniformly in the eye of the beholder. I can say that with only one child and limited property, it sounds as if you do not have a very complex divorce. But I have seen what should have been the simplest of divorces turn into the most highly contested, and petty affairs. Therefore, I would suggest that you contact an experienced family law practitioner in order to further discuss your options."

    "title": "Can I submit a property appraisal in a ch 7 in Los Angeles court?",
    "question": "It appears I qualify for the $175,000 homestead exemption to file chapter 7. However, with all loans and exemption, and considering my property value. It appears I will have about $8,000 in equity left. I have $90,000 in outstanding debt. Do any lawyers out there have experience in my scenario with Los Angeles trustees on how or if they will sell my property? If I do a property appraisal, and it supports my property value, can I submit it to the trustee for consideration on his decision to sell my property? Thank you",

        "I agree with me colleagues, $8,000 of equity is not much and will likely be eaten up by cost of sale, however, I highly recommend being represented by an attorney. You will want to obtain an appraisal ahead of time and make absolutely sure you qualify for the $175,000 homestead exemption. If the trustee does move to sell your property, you can oppose their motion, and the Judge will ultimately make the orders.",
        "I agree with my colleague Bob Firth. I would also note that if the basis for you to qualify for the $175,000 homestead exemption is having attained age 65, it may be possible that your property has also appreciated considerably over the years of ownership. Bear in mind that if the trustee were to contemplate a forced sale of your home, any capital gains taxes that might result would be the responsibility of the bankruptcy estate, not you. Accordingly, this could also factor into the decision to administer the excess equity, if any exists after factoring in the costs of sale. I also agree that you would be wise to consult an experienced attorney.",
        "Did you factor in the cost of selling your home? The trustee is responsible for the legal fees and broker commission relating to the sale of the house. Take 7% off your estimated sale price of your home when you calculate the net that would be available to the unsecured creditors. Also, keep in mind that homes sold in bankruptcy tend to command less than fair market value. See a bankruptcy lawyer for details."

    "title": "Can a creditor from a RV loan sue for deficiency that may result from auction sale after the repo from a Ch. 7 BK from 4 yrs ago",
    "question": "I did not reaffirm this loan after chapter 7 bankruptcy was discharged in December of 2010 but I have continued to make payments. I am current on payments but I am considering returning the RV to creditor for auction. I was told by RV creditor that I would be responsible for any remaining balance due on loan after auction. If I did not reaffirm the loan after chapter 7 bankruptcy is their a time limit after discharge that the loan can be automatically reaffirmed by the creditor? Can the creditor still sue if loan was never reaffirmed? Can this be reported to credit bureau and negatively effect my credit score?",
    "answers": [
        "All of my colleagues who advised you that you no longer owe the $ are correct. However, since you no doubt need the money, you almost want the creditor to continue trying to make you pay including suing you, that way you get to reopen your bankruptcy and file a Motion for Sanctions against the creditor and then you may be able to go buy a new boat.",
        "You are simply not liable. it was discharged. They could possibly be sued for even saying such a thing. But let it go..You wont owe anything and if they give you a 1099 later, talk to your CPA or accountant as you will see here on AVVO you will NOT owe taxes on it. Meanwhile, you could actually use it w/o making ANY payments on it, enjoy it this summer, and then when all done, and home, they will finally catch up with you and repo it. Remove your personal belongings. Then upon repo, cancel insurance when you don't want it, and let the state know you no longer possess it so it is not in your name and if fined, it will not by your fine!",
        "You should contact your BK attorney if you had one or can get a hold of them. They will be able to contact the creditor. But as long as you have not reaffirmed the debt there is no legal contract for them to collect on the remaining balance.",
        "Your bankruptcy in 2010 included the debt on the RV, right? Even if you continued to pay the payments after the BK, that does obligate you to pay any deficiency balance, unless you formally reaffirmed with the creditor. Tell the collection agency/RV lender's agent to \"go pound sand\". Did you have an atty in your BK? If so, contact him/her immediately to inform him of what is being told to you. He/she can send a letter to the lender warning them to back off or face a lawsuit for violation of the discharge injunction.",
        "If the creditor tries to sue, your bankruptcy discharge is your defense. And you can bring a claim in bankruptcy court against the lender for damages. Stop listening to morons working for your lender. Lenders lie and the folks you are talking to do not have a legal education and may not even have a high school diploma. Hope this perspective helps.",
        "Agree with colleagues. BK discharge relieved you of personal liability. Can be reported to credit bureau and have negative impact on your credit. however, such report would violate FDCPA. You may have cause of action against creditor in both BK and federal courts. Consult an attorney competent in BK and FDCPA law."

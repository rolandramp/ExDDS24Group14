    "question": "I understand they can do this. And I understand that having a joint account, I risk this. However, it is how I pay my bills and can't afford to open a new account for just me, yet.",

        "If you're receiving aid, you've assigned your right to collect support from dad to the state, in exchange for getting the aid payments. DCSS will then, on behalf of the taxpayers, seek to collect that reimbursement from dad, including from any account with dad's name on it.",
        "The problem was that you had a joint bank account. Since your husband had the legal right to all of the money in the account, DCSS could consider all of this money his.\n\nOpen an account in your individual name, otherwise this could happen again.",
        "It sounds like you already know the answer, but yes, if the individual they are seeking to collect from is a joint account holder they can levy the account, even if he was not the source of the funds. I agree with you the system could you and overhaul, to say the least. As you mentioned, the right thing to do is to open a completely separate bank account that is only in your name. You can usually open an account with only a minimal deposit, maybe $50 or so, which should at least solve this problem in the future."

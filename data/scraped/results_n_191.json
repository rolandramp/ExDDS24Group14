    "title": "How can an attorney sue me for a debt that is 13 years old?",
    "question": "I recently was notified via writ of execution from the sheriffs office in regards to a judgement. I was never even notified of a court date nor did i have any clue someone was suing me. It turns out its my landlord from 13 years ago trying to collect now for move out discrenpencies. The previous landlord is also an attorney himself. I thought California has a 4 year statue of limitations on debt collecting? What can I do since he got a judgement? How did the courts even allow for him to obtain a judgement on a 13 year old debt? I'm so confused. I was researching online and it said it's illegal for him to sue someone with a debt this old especially he is an attorney he should now better. I would really appreciate some help thank you so much.",

        "I agree with the other answers. Most likely you were sued many years ago and served by substitute service (e.g. publication in a newspaper) and the judgment was entered. Bottom line is there is obviously a judgment against you, so you can either (1) seek to set aside the judgment in state court if you have a legal basis to do so (such as improper service of the summons/complaint). That is an expensive way to go and may not be a high likelihood of winning; (2) settle with them and make payment arrangements or (3) file a bankruptcy case to deal with this and any other debts you might have.\n\nI suggest you have a consultation with an experienced bankruptcy attorney in your State to learn about your eligibility and options.",
        "There is an insufficient factual basis to answer this online. You need to retain an experienced CA bankruptcy attorney to determine your options. THIS IS NOT LEGAL ADVICE! YOU NEED TO SPEAK TO AN ATTORNEY WHO IS LICENSED IN YOUR STATE FOR LEGAL ADVICE. This is merely suggestions for you to think about in discussing your situation with the local attorney.",
        "More information is needed to give you useful advice. Perhaps, the judgment was obtained within 4 years of the date you last paid, but the service of the lawsuit was flawed or non-existent.

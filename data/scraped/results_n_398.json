        "I also agree with Attorney Rode. I strongly urge you to speak with an experienced bankruptcy attorney to fully analyze your debt, assets and income in order to properly advise you regarding the options for resolution of your financial issues.",
        "I also agree with Attorney Rode with the additional caveat: Don't try this without an experienced bankruptcy attorney.",
        "Atty Rode has accurately analyzed your scenario. Absent some compelling reasons, a Chapter 11 makes no sense.",
        "You can, but it is the best course of action, I cannot advise on that without more information. What type of debts would you not be able to discharge in a chapter 7? More than likely, you would want to consider a chapter 13 after a chapter 7 (instead of a chapter 11) to reorganize. Chapter 11s are usually for businesses or high net worth individuals. A chapter 13 is much simpler, less expensive, and gives you up to a 5 year repayment plan. I would definitely recommend speaking with some experienced bankruptcy attorneys regarding your best options."

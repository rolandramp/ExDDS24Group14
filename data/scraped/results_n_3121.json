    "question": "trust was amended on 9/7/11. Since my mother passed on on 5/11/14, the beneficiaries have found that my youngest brother has drained a lot of the assets and accumulated a lot of debt against my mom's estate. The beneficiaries and myself were not made aware of the amendment until after it had been completed by my mother, my youngest brother and their attorney. I live in California. Are the beneficiaries liable to any of the debt and can we sue the trust or my youngest brother and make him accountable?",

        "I agree with my colleagues. You have already received some good feedback. The keys being that there is not enough information to give you competent advice nor should such advice be sought in this forum which is for general direction only.\n\nA consultation with an attorney should reveal what rights you and your siblings may have. Based on when and how the debt as incurred, you may have rights against your sibling to recover. However, the primary place to look will be the estate plan itself. After that, the conduct of the trustee and successor trustee to verify if it is aligned with the rights and powers granted with the trust.\n\nIt's an involved process that cannot be discussed meaningfully here. However, it is unlikely beneficiaries could be liable for debts. By definition, you are supposed to be recipient of a gift. The worst that normally happens is there is nothing left for you to take.\n\nDepending on how much we're talking about, it could be a good idea to hire an attorney.\n\nGood luck to you.",
        "There is not really enough info here to give a complete answer but I can say with relatively certainty that the debt will not become yours and you can and should hold your brother accountable for any misdeeds.",
        "Hello,\n\nPlease note that the Successor Trustee cannot act unless there are provisions in the trust that allow him to take over in case the initial trustee -- your Mom -- is incapacitated or your Mom gives him authority to be Trustee now.\n\nSo you are saying that your brother took over as Successor Trustee when the trust was amended in 2011? If yes, then any debt incurred by the trust is solely the debt of the trust.\n\nUnfortunately you cannot get an accounting for what occurred when your Mother was alive, but if you have solid proof of your brother's actions, it is highly recommended that you consult with a local trust administration attorney to explore your options.\n\nGood luck,",
        "There is a lot going on here and not enough information. The amendment may have been the result of undue influence and if it benedited your brother and he participated then cwrtain presumptions may arise which would help you. It is unclear if the debt occured before or after you brother's role as successor trustee and whether or not that debt was incurred to benefit your mother's care. If it was after her death for you brother's own benefit, then you have a very solid footing for a lawsuit. I would recommend consulting with a local attorney. I just finished a case like this and it can take some time to resolve (I.e. two years)."

        "It is always good to file a Notice of Chapter 7. Call the court clerk for guidance, and file as soon as possible.",
        "It certainly prevents problems down the road. The state court knows there's a bankruptcy and won't take any further action regarding the case.",
        "Without an attorney, you will likely have many questions about what is going to happen. The Notice of Stay suspends the state court proceedings. If all goes well you will get a discharge of your debts which will include the pending lawsuit. However, if you have any debts arising from problematic origins, like drunk driving, fraud, family law support judgments, tax and student loan debts, those debts may survive your bankruptcy and you will still owe them.",
        "I would.\n\nDid you include the credit tort and its attorney on the matrix of creditors",
        "That is a requirement under the Bankruptcy local rules. If you think about it, that does make sense. The credit now has notice, and if he fails to abide by the stay, you have evidence that he had notice. It also gives the state court Judge notice that he probably doesn't have to spend time preparing for this case."

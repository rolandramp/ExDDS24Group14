        "You will need to set up a California business entity in such a way as to make clear that a qualifying relaationship exists with the Canadian entity (either one owning more than 50% of the other, or both owned more than 50% by the same 3rd party - most likely you). This can be done while you are here, as can a consultation with an immigration attorney.\n\nYou will need to show a business plan, organizational structure of both entities, evidence that you havve been employed by the Canadian entity for at least a year, and a description of the role you will be performing for the new U.S. entity. This role will need to meet certain requirements - and attorney can explain the specifics here. You will need to show documentation of the set-up of U.S. operations - funded operating accounts, lease for busines spremises and business equipment, etc.\n\nAs a new company, you will only get a year initially - at the end off thiss time you will need to show growth and stability in the U.S. entity (USCIS will want to see additional employees on payroll - even if this isn't traditionally a labor-intensive business).\n\nAs an owner coming on L-2, there are certain additional requirements concerning intent not to remain permanently.\n\nSpeak with aa lawyer about specifics - and to ensure that the L-1 - as opposed to the E-1 or E-2 - is really the best option for you..\n\nGood luck with your new venture!",

        "Mr. Steingraber is spot on. YOU, personally, cannot handle this.\n\nNot to be rude, but, you'd need to evaluate your home equity, the type of lien, understand exemptions; then, reopen your case and file a 522 motion (if the right type of lien is trying to be avoided).",
        "Chances are you can't remove the lien, but maybe your BK lawyer can. If he/she is still around, start there. If not, get another experienced BK lawyer by using the Avvo feature \"Find a Lawyer\". Make a list of 4-5 having many 5 star reviews from satisfied clients. If you don't get a prompt call back from one, go on to the next on your list. Some offer a free consultation by phone or in person. Take us up on it.",
        "when you file on a secured debt like a home loan your debt while discharged is still against the property itself and does not go away. You can try to negotiate with them and see if they are willing to settle for something less. They are not obligated to accept but its always worth it. If the lien is involuntary and meets several criteria you may be able to remove it via a motion to avoid lien. This is not usually included in your chapter 7 retainer.",
        "While I agree with Michael Salanick, the starting point would be to obtain an appraisal of the value of the residence on the date in 2012 when you filed the prior Chapter 7 case. You will also need to provide evidence of the balances owing on the loans secured by the residence on that date, and if the resulting equity is no greater than the amount of the homestead available to you on that date, you would have grounds to \"avoid\", meaning extinguish the lien.\n\nEven if you did not claim the homestead at that time, you are allowed to amend to do so, if you reopen the case. Back then, the amount of the homestead was $75,000 for single debtors, $100,000 for married debtors and heads of household, and $175,000 for persons age 65 or older, disabled, or with low level income.\n\nOnce you have determined that the facts support your case to avoid the judgment lien, it is a simple process to reopen the case and file the motion to avoid lien using the mandatory court form. While most such cases are not opposed by the judgment creditors, and can be handled for a relatively modest fee, that is not always the case.\n\nI just finished successfully avoiding a renewed judgment lien that had been created in 2004 against my client's late husband, and no fewer than five attorneys represented the creditor, a \"debt buyer\" which trades on misery, over a span of almost 6 months. That type of the litigious behavior is the exception, not the rule and hopefully you will not encounter such opposition.",
        "I agree 100% with Attorney Salanak but add that if you find out it is a valid judgment lien, then before paying an attorney $1500 or whatever the fee is, see if the creditor will accept $1000 in consideration of entering a full satisfaction of judgment so that it is gone FAST. Argue they will get zero if you have to file the motion and rather pay them $1000 instead of your attorney. If they say yes, you are happy! Good luck.",
        "If the lien was something you agreed to such as a home equity line or a 2nd mortgage used when financing the home purchase, bankruptcy won't help.\n\nIf the lien is a judgment lien, however, under certain circumstances it may be possible to eliminate the lien using a provision of bankruptcy law under 11 USC section 522(f).\n\nFor this to work, you need to have the facts evaluated to determine equity in your home at the time of your bankruptcy filing, if you have exempted the equity in your bankruptcy case from 2012, and if the lien in question \"impairs the exemption\". If the analysis results favorably, then you may be able to reopen your bankruptcy case AND then complete the extensive legal work required when preparing Motion to Avoid Judgment Lien on Real Property. If successful, the lien will be avoided. Expect 45-60 days minimum start to finish since all secured creditors must be notified and given an opportunity to respond to your Motion and evidence."

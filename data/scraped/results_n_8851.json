        "The IRS is a supercreditor with rights that are unavailable to other creditors. One of their most powerful tools is lein rights. If your husband owes tax debts, he could be subject to a lien against the property (more specifically, a \"statutory\" lien based on 6321 of the Internal Revenue Code). The timing of the lien is tough to beat. It arises when a taxpayer fails to pay any tax after a demand by the IRS for payment. And the lien \"relates back” to the date of assessment of the tax, meaning that it is effective from that day forward. So simply transferring property out of his name to yours may not be the best strategy. The IRS lien could still follow the property into your hands.",

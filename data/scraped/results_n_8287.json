        "Pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure § 337, the statute of limitations for debt related to a written contract is four years, and an oral contract is two years from the date of breach.\n\nIf your vehicle was repossessed more than four years before a debt collector files a deficiency lawsuit, the four-year statute of limitations for breach of contract can bar the debt collector's claim. However, the statute of limitations is not an automatic defense. You as the consumer must appear and bring that issue to the court's attention. (Likewise, the debt collector can call you without filing a lawsuit to see if you will pay.)",

        "The statute of limitations on a car contract is four years from date of last payment or breach of contract, whichever is later. Collection calls may continue past the statute of limitations, but the collector may not threaten to sue you or garnish your wages, unless they filed the lawsuit several years ago. If you are sued now, more than four years after the repossession, you need a lawyer to defend you in that case, as they may have violated the debt collection laws that protect you from untimely lawsuits.\n\nIn the second link, below, are sample letters that you can use to dispute the debt.

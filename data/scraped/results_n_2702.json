    "title": "Car loan statute of limitations in California?",
    "question": "2002, bought a used car. 2005, became partially disabled and eventually declared bankruptcy (Feb 2006). Discharged (May 2006), but attorney handling that for me had nervous breakdown and was suspended by the bar before she could fix her mess of a redemption motion (I was going to keep the car and pay it off at the current value, through a new (722?) loan). Car and I have been in limbo ever since. I can't afford to pay it off for whatever the loan amount was (though might have, at the then KBB value). I've always lived (same place) in a gated area so repo men could never get to it (tried 2x I think, years ago), though I drive it whenever I'm able (car was never 'hidden' or anything). Always expect it to vanish from a meter or... Is statute of limitations past; can it be still be repo'd?",

        "Yes. Vehicle can be repossessed. There is no statute of limitations which limits time period to repossess a vehicle. If you are in arrears, creditor can repossess vehicle.\nIf debt not reaffirmed, you are not personally liable for any arrears.",
        "The Statute of Limitations applies to filing a lawsuit. The SOL does not apply to put a time limit on repossession. As long as you are in possession of the car, and you owe on it, they can repo. As far as your BK is concerned, it would be necessary for an attorney to review all of the case documents before giving you advise."

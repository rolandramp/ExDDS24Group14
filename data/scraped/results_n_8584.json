    "answers": [
        "When you say, “intentional tort” I think of 11 U.S.C. 523. It lists several debts that cannot be discharged.\n\nDebts from willful and malicious injury to another or another's property (11 U.S.C. 523 (a)(6)) - an intentional tort (conversion, assault, battery, etc. . .)\n\nDebts incurred on the basis of fraudulent acts (11 U.S.C. 523 (a)(2)).\n\nDebts from embezzlement, larceny or breach of trust (fiduciary duty)(11 U.S.C. 523(a)(4)). This will be conversion type of tort.\n\nFines or restitution (to the court or victim) imposed in a criminal-type proceeding (11 U.S.C. 523 (a)(7) and 18 U.S.C. 3613). This may be assault or battery, even theft (conversion) etc.\n\nDebts resulting from intoxicated driving (11 U.S.C. 523 (a)(9)). Vehicular assault or battery.\n\nBut, if you are the judgment creditor, you must file an adversary proceeding objecting the discharge on the particular debt. You must file this action within 30 days from the 341 meeting. The notice of bankruptcy filing should show these dates (deadlines). If the creditor shows up at 341, he/she can ask few questions but I think the trustee usually does not let the questioning to go on by the creditor. The debtor is under oath, so the debtor should answer questions truthfully and completely.",
        "Have an attorney who handles creditors' rights review the judgment and underlying claim to determine whether it is exempt from discharge. If so, then file an Adversary Proceeding. If not, then walk away.\n\n[This communication is intended as general information and not specific legal advice, and this communication does not create an attorney-client relationship.]",
        "Torts that are negligent generally ARE dischargeable while torts that are willful generally ARE NOT. Assuming the torts are of the nondischargeable variety you will need to file a nondischargeability action. This is something you will want to discuss with a bankruptcy attorney."

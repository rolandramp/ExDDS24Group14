    "title": "I am a US Citizen having issues getting a passport.",
    "question": "Never had a passport before but already applied for 1. I have been required to send additonal info such as employers, residences, family info, etc. I do not understand why I'm being asked to send all of this information including some that I do not see how it is relevant in order to get a passport. Seems like they issued one a while ago even when apparently I failed to establish my identity in a satisfactorily manner. Are there any cases of US Citizens who were denied a passport? Is this even possible?",

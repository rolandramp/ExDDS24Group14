    "title": "If I'm approved for SSDI/SSI but owe back taxes, does my lump sum pay goes to the IRS?",
    "question": "I just had a hearing for my SSDI/SSI and the Doctor approved it but the judge didn't give me a final answer yet. I know I will get an approval, but I owe about $30000 in back taxes. Does all my lump sum pay goes to the IRS before it comes to me? if so, what if I file for bankruptcy before I get paid? I don't mind paying some of the taxes I owe, but I don't want to loose it all. Help...",

        "I agree with the above posters. With regard to your bankruptcy question, yes, the debt is dischargeable in bankruptcy. You need to consult with a bankruptcy attorney to get more details.",
        "Because the amount you owe is relatively small you should be able to work out a payment plan over the phone with the IRS. Before you attempt to do this you need to determine all of your income versus all of your claimable expenses. You can get a lot of information regarding the IRS allowable expenses on the Website for theUnited States Trustee Program, region 16. The expenses and allowances are figured out for the bankruptcy court based on the IRS national standards. With this information you can determine what would be the right amount to offer for a payment plan as well as for an offer in compromise. Either should be fairly easy for an experienced attorney to get you though in possibly minutes, if you do it for self and plan the offer based on good sound information you could also do it.",

See IRS explanation below\n\nhttp://www.irs.gov/Individuals/Social-Security-Benefits-Eligible-for-the-Federal-Payment-Levy-Program\n\nYou may want to consult with an enrolled agent or CPA with IRS collection to see if an offer in compromise could be entertained.\n\nBest of luck."

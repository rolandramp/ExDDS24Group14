    "title": "In California and received a summons for hospital debt from 2010. Do I appear in court for defense of statute of limitations ?",
    "question": "I incurred hospital debt Nov 2010. I was unemployed and never made a payment. I received a summons to appear in court. I missed the 30 day response and now need to appear in court in 2 weeks. Can I file the defense for statute of limitations on the court date or need to file something? Is it too late to file a defense since this debt is years outside of the statute of limitations?",
    "answers": [
        "It sounds like you were served a complaint for medical debt and missed the period to respond. Unless there is a good reason why you did not respond, courts are fairly strict on those deadlines. How much is the debt for and can you afford to pay it? If not, I suggest you explore your bankruptcy options. Bankruptcy can likely make this debt go away where you would not be responsible for paying it back. At the very least, you should speak with an experienced bankruptcy attorney so you know what bankruptcy and non-bankruptcy options you have available (i.e. debt settlement).",
        "You can still respond unless the plaintiff has filed a request for entry of default.\n\nIf you answer, you must raise the statute of limitations as an affirmative defense.\n\nIf there is a sound reason to explain why you could not file a timely answer, you could move to set aside the default and have more time to answer.",
        "I agree, you should contact a reputable/qualified bankruptcy attorney.\n\nHowever, to address the 30-day response period and your court date. If you failed to respond timely, it's likely the creditor obtained a default judgment, in which case there is NO COURT DATE. Upon receipt of the entry of default and default judgment, the court vacates the hearing. So, what you need to do immediately is check the court site to determine if the default was entered. If it was not, then get your answer on file immediately asserting the statute of limitations defense. If it's been more than a year since the entry of default, there's not much you can do. California allows a short-time period for setting aside a judgment."

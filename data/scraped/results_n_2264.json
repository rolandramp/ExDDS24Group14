        "Once a corporation has been completely dissolved, it does not exist anymore. If you have not dissolved it but began the dissolution process, you can cancel that and re-institute the corporation’s good standing. The same can be said if the corporation has fallen out of standing or has been suspended due to unpaid franchise taxes. However, if you have actually dissolved the corporation, you will need to form a new one.",
        "As suggested by Mr. Kane the sec. Of state would be a good place to start. Also the FTB should also be contacted regarding whether \"final\" tax return was filed when entity was \"dissolved\". Or FTB is owed missing returns and taxes due since entity was not properly \"dissolved\". So your use of \"dissolved\" is not clear, whether an internal meeting to dissolve or a complete and procedurally proper \"dissolution\" including all the internal as well as external administrative requirements to clear FTB as well as the Secretary of State and the shareholder(s) , debts, liabilities, assets and final federal and state returns.\n\nIf properly dissolved then it can not get \"reactivated \". It's done and closed the final return is filed. You would simply start a new entity.\n\nYou would benefit from consulting with a business attorney to review all your records as well as FTB and sec. Of state records to inform you of your standing and options.",
        "Contact the California Secretary of State for the information you seek. Please note that in my experience, the Secretary of State will not revive a dissolved corporation without a Court order that the corporation was dissolved in error."

        "Yes. I have successfully represented creditors who had their default fraud judgments determined non dischargeable in bankruptcy. You will need to engage a bankruptcy attorney in Tennessee.",
        "You MUST file an Adversary Proceeding in his bankruptcy case to have your debt declared non-dischargeable by the bankruptcy court. You have 60 days from the first 341 hearing in the case to file the Adversary complaint in the bankruptcy court where his case is pending. An adversary proceeding is a lawsuit within his bankruptcy case that says your debt cannot be wiped out because it was obtained by fraud. This must be done no later than 60 days from the date of the first 341 hearing in the case. This deadline cannot be extended and if you miss it your debt will be discharged even if it was based on fraud.",
        "This can be a rather complicated answer. Yes, you will have to file an adversary case in the BK case in order to have the debt declared nondishargeable. If you do not do that then your debt will be discharged regardless of your judgment. You have a limited time to file one so I would not delay. The real question is whether or not your default judgment will have any res judicata effect or will you have to litigate. Usually in order to get res judicata under those facts depends upon whether or not there was actual testimony (in a prove up) or evidence regarding the fraud. Without that you just might have to litigate which you need to evaluate if it is financially reasonable for you to pursue.",
        "Fraud in the bankruptcy court has a different definition than fraud in the civil courts. You will have to re-litigate the matter in the bankruptcy court and obtain a non-dischargeable judgment.",
        "While Bankruptcy Courts will normally honor a fraud judgment of another court, default judgments get into a potentially tricky area that requires comparing the complaint, judgment, the specific allegations deemed admitted by the default, and even a comparison of the elements of fraud between state and federal law. A lawyer in TN who does BR litigation should be able to give you a solid opinion and you might have a summary judgment case. Even then, it may or may not be worth the expense of the lawyer and then trying too collect.",
        "As suggested by the other attorney, you must file with the court to have an Adverse Proceeding to determine that the judgment is non-dischargable. Fraud is a reason that a debt can not be discharged; however, it must be proven (the court does not assume that because you have a judgment it is automatically considered non-discharable). You have a limited time to act. You need to file your Adversary Proceeding before the period to object is over, which is 60 days after the Meeting of Creditors. You should see a bankruptcy attorney immediately. Depending on the laws in California and the bankruptcy court in Tennessee, the default judgment may or may not be enough to satisfy the requirements of the court. You may potentially have to prove that the judgment was fraud, which is something your bankruptcy attorney can discuss with you.\n\nAdversary proceedings are complicated, and in reality a separate lawsuit. Failing to do things properly and not in a timely manner will result in your claim being discharged. Talk to an attorney today. You can use Avvo's Find a Lawyer tool to find a bankruptcy attorney in your area.",
        "You should file an adversary proceeding asking for the debt to be non-dischargeable in the bankruptcy court of Tennessee. Just because you may have gotten a default judgment in federal court in Los Angeles does not mean the debt won't still be discharged in Tennessee if you take no action. 11 USC 523(a)(2) & (4) which are exceptions to discharge for fraud require an adversary proceeding to be filed under 11 USC 523(c)(1) prior to the discharge. Failure to do so may cause this debt to be discharged. So you have a limited time to act. I would highly suggest you seek bankruptcy counsel in Tennessee to handle this action on your behalf ASAP. Good Luck!"

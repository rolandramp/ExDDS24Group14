        "Unfortunately, this is not a question that can be answered \"yes\" or \"no\" under the circumstances. The claim CAN be separate property, but it is almost certainly a community property claim. However, there are statutes that define which party has the right to the actual proceeds, despite the claim being community.\n\nThis is going to require not only an experienced bankruptcy attorney, but consultation with a good family law attorney who is willing to research the case law about those statutes. Jumping into a chapter 7 without excellent legal advice and representation is asking for trouble.\n\nYou also need to have a good discussion with a bankruptcy attorney about the language and effect of the various exemption statutes and apply them to your exact situation.",
        "There is a very high chance the trustee could take over your PI lawsuit. If the injury occurred when you were married then the lawsuit will likely be deemed community property and the trustee could prosecute the case and take part of the settlement to satisfy your husband's creditors. I am not saying this is a guarantee to happen as maybe the trustee will not see much merit in the lawsuit and may not want to take it over. You or your husband definitely need to seek a bankruptcy attorney for representation to make sure the lawsuit is protected, if possible, or possibly advise against filing bankruptcy at this time, if appropriate. I hope this helps.",
        "You need to discuss with an experienced CA Bankruptcy Attorney first. CA is also a community property state and thus all assets that are community and any separate property of the filing spouse are part of the estate. But other issues and facts can gravely affect your case so I will point those out next for you also.\n\nYou need and want to enjoy your fresh start also. But the most important thing is to meet with an attorney as you asking this question means you have not. You care about 2 goals: keeping everything you have equity in and discharging all your debts. If you don't have any of the exceptions to discharge you will obtain that goal; most exceptions are set forth in 11 USC. 523 (Google it) like child support, some income taxes, traffic (in a ch 7) and criminal fines , and presumption of student loans. But some debts are dischargeable in a ch 13 but NOT in a ch 7 so you want to make sure and your attorney will discuss any such types with you also!\n\nYour exemptions depend on what state you have lived in in the last 2 years and thus if in your state, then your states exemptions will apply. Most persons filing keep everything they own but your attorney will confirm that with you when they learn everything you own and the equity thereof!\n\nSome secured debts like homes, vehicles, other secured debts an attorney will discuss your options on also as you must list any debts; but that does not mean you will lose them unless you have too much equity or are in default on paying for them! Discuss those options if they apply with your attorney too.\n\nBut other issues can arise that can greatly harm your case. Just one example: If you paid back a relative $3,000 11 months ago and now file bankruptcy next week, the trustee can SUE that relative to retrieve that $3,000 (under what is called a preference) for the benefit of the bankruptcy estate. As a result, most attorneys don't charge to meet with them the first meeting so meet with one no matter what.\n\nMany great attorneys can be found right here on AVVO in your state so look, call, and meet one as soon as you can.\n\nYou should also want to know when to file: is there an advantage of waiting versus filing now and who should you pay between now and then! Good luck and enjoy your later fresh start."

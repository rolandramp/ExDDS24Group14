        "Whether you can discharge all or part of the $10,000 owed to your ex depends on the what the money is payment of. The previous commentors are correct in that the debt is not dischargeable if it is for alimony, spousal or child support. You should discuss the debt with your bankruptcy attorney to determine whether the debt is potentially dischargeable after review of the appropriate documentation.\n\nIf you don't have any attorney already, you should contact an attorney in your area.\n\nScott Jordan\n\nDisclaimer: The comments made is for informational purposes only and not meant as specific advice to a specific legal question.",
        "That depends on what it is for. If it is for alimony, spousal support, or child support, the short answer is \"no\". The 2005 amendments to the Bankruptcy Code refer to these as \"domestic support obligations\", and they are generally not dischargeable under any chapter of the Bankruptcy Code. If it is an issue of property distribution, you may be able to discharge it in a Chapter 13, provided that you complete the entire Chapter 13 Plan you set up. You can not discharge property distributions in a Chapter 7 at all.\n\nThis is a very technical part of the bankruptcy code, and one which you should seek competent counsel for in your area.\n\nThis does not constitute legal advice in your case. I am licensed to practice in Pennsylvania, and am unfamiliar with California law. While bankruptcy law is federal law, many rights and interests in property and debts are determined under state law, which will affect your case.",
        "If it is part of the bankruptcy decree it is not a judgment. If it is a property distribution you may be able to discharge it in a chapter 13 but a chapter 7 will not discharge it. If the order is in the nature of an order of support it could be found to be non-dischargeable. So, while it is always included in your bankruptcy because it is a debt, it may or may not be dischargeable given the nature of the obligation and the chapter you file."

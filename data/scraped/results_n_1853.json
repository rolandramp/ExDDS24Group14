    "title": "I want to report fraud in a bankruptcy filing. Will this help me get money back that I lost to the fraudster?",
    "question": "I was defrauded by a business; they promised a service, collected payment, and didn't deliver. Online research reveals that they have done the same to many other people. I have recently learned that the business owner is filing bankruptcy. Their filing does not disclose any income from this specific business. I want to report this to the bankruptcy trustee as possible fraud. I am also considering reporting the fraudulent business to my state's attorney general and to local law enforcement.",

        "Yes. You may report the fraud to the trustee assigned to the matter. Do so in writing and by appearance at BK 341 Meeting of Creditor's.\nYes. You may report fraud to State AG and law enforcement.\nBe careful not to cross line into taking action to collect the debt while the debtor is protected by the BK Automatic Stay. Doing so may subject you to sanctions and penalties.\nChances of getting some or all of your money back depend on several factors, including, not limited to:\n-dischargeability of debt\n-asset recovery by trustee\n-amount of your claim and other claims of priority, secured and unsecured creditors\nConsult BK counsel before investing alot of time and energy into this matter.",
        "Basically, a duplicate post, and the reality is that you are in the same position, and have the same feelings, that thousands of others have every day when businesses close. Reporting fraud in Bankruptcy does not give you a claim and only just concluding yourself you have been defrauded does not get money back. That said, you can spend all the time and energy you want to pursue it and see what happens and many lawyers will be happy to get fees and a retainer to pursue it but, as I said before, don't throw good money after bad when lawyers already know the chances of getting a dime in the average case is close to zero. How much did you lose?",
        "In a Chapter 7 case, there are basically three different people/groups involved in the administration of the case, and each has separate duties and goals. In a situation like yours, you may consider involving all three as you try to recoup your losses or at least feel like some justice has been served.\n\nThe Chapter 7 trustee would be interested to know if the debtor had assets that hadn't been disclosed properly. If you actually have evidence that the person might, you can attend the meeting of creditors and ask questions of the debtor himself. Please note that most trustees will only permit questions that go to the purpose of discovering undisclosed assets. They aren't going to allow an investigation into whether you were defrauded in your payment for services. The chapter 7 trustee does not care about that\n\nNext, you have the U.S. Trustee who oversees each case to ensure it has been filed under the correct chapter and that rules and laws related to that purpose are being followed. They also go after people who've committed bankruptcy fraud. Bankruptcy fraud could be many things, but it would include failing to disclose assets or income or misrepresting other important elements of one's bankruptcy case. If you have good evidence that the debtor has done something like this, you can report it to the office of the U.S. Trustee.\n\nLast, but not least, you have the judge. Her job is to oversee the enitere case. In most chapter 7 cases, she does so from the sidelines, so to speak, and doesn't have any obvious participation in the administration of the case. If there are issues, in most cases, a party to the case or one of the trustees above might brings the issue to her attention, and she resolves it formally in her courtroom. If you believe, and more importantly, have strong evidence that you were defrauded in your purchase of services, you would need to file an adversary proceeding to prove that fraud. Filing an adversary proceeding is basically the same as filing a lawsuit, and unless you have experience filing lawsuits in federal court, you will need to find an attorney who has. And, not just any attorney will do. You'll need one who handles bankruptcy adversary proceedings specifically. Before hiring an attorney, you'll need to consider the money you've lost vs. the amount of money you are about to spend to try to get it back vs. the chances of actually getting a dime EVEN IF you actually win. This process can also take many, many months, so you'll need to consider how much time you want to spend.\n\nIt would be worth the time and small fee to sit down with an experienced bankruptcy attorney who represents creditors to get information on your best options in your specific case. If you are just understandably upset and frustrated by the fact that you didn't get what you paid for, you'll likely find only more frustration in the bankruptcy court. If you actually have a smoking gun of actual fraud, you may succeed, but it will almost undoubtedly cost you money upfront. And, sadly, at the end of the day, even if you win, and the debt owed by this guy to you is determined to be one that survives the bk, if the guy has no money or is very good about hiding it, you may never see a penny of it.\n\nThis could be a situation where you just need to move on, but do speak with a bankruptcy attorney with creditor rights experienced attorney in your area to be sure.",
        "Most attempts to collect the debt outside of the bankruptcy proceeding can be considered a violation of the Automatic Stay. People that violate this section can be sanctioned and be required to pay the attorneys fees incurred.\n\nOne of the exceptions to the Automatic Stay is the commencement or continuation of a criminal action or\nproceeding against the debtor. However, if you are wrong about the action of the debtor being criminal, then you could be held liable for violation of the Automatic Stay and and the wrong end of a malicious prosecution suit.\n\nAlthough you can file an Adversary Proceeding (AP) in the bankruptcy case, the cost, $350.00 filing fee plus attorneys fees, and whether your chance of collecting if you prevail in the AP, must be considered before taking this action.\n\nBefore you take any action, you need to take the time to meet with an experienced bankruptcy attorney that understands the issues involved in business bankruptcy cases.

    "title": "Do I need to pay to get my vehicle out of impound just to turn it over to lender after filing Chapter 7?",
    "question": "My wife and I filed Chapter 7 with the courts nearly a month ago. We had decided to give up the truck and listed it as such with the court when we filed. We were going to give the vehicle over to a bank branch this weekend but the truck was towed today by the city police for being on the street for more than 72 hours. The police want $150 and we don't even know how much the towing company wants to release the vehicle back to us.",

        "You may not have to pay the towing and impound fees, but this event occurred post-bankruptcy and the towing and storage companies may well come after you for those costs. Your best course would be to contact the lender on the vehicle, tell them where the car is giving address and names of people at the tow yard. If you have an extra set of keys, take them to the branch of the lender, hand the keys to an officer or other responsible person and ask them to sign a receipt, describing the car in detail. You are turning over the car to the lender. You cannot include these costs in your bankruptcy because they occurred after you filed.",
        "You will simply need to inform the finance company of the location of the vehicle. It is then their problem to get ot out of impound.",
        "The fee the city is asking for may be deemed to be a fine and may not be discharge-able in bankruptcy. The money that the towing company may ask is another issue. You will probably want to amend your list of creditors to include them. Technically they are post petition, but the debt is in connection with a pre-petition obligation. I assume that your petition states your intention to return the vehicle to the lender and you or your attorney may already have correspondence to that effect with the lender. In that case you have an argument that the vehicle was not even your responsibility and it is the lenders obligation to pay the fine and the fee. Even so, talk to your attorney about amending to get these debts included in the bankruptcy and discharged. Good luck!",
        "With respect to the lender, all you have to do is tell them where the vehicle is. They can try to go get it.\n\nYou will want to check to ensure that the impound will not attempt to impose personal liability if the car is not released from impound. In most places, they will just take the fees out on the vehicle, but you want to make sure that they will not try to collect from you if the bank does not get the vehicle released."

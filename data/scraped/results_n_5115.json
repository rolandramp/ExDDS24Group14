    "title": "I was one of three co-signers on a bail bonds and now being held responsible for the whole amount. Is this right?",
    "question": "I was 1/3 cosigners on a bail and now being responsible and threatened to pay the full amount because he skipped court.I ended up helping the bail bonds out and turning him in and it reduced the bail I'd owe. But now there still holding me responsible for the total amount and have not contacting the other two cosigners.Who the other two clearly wont pay a dime because them live off the system.How did they even qualify?I complained and got the amount reduced three way for each cosigner.I was on a payment plan and paid over $3000 already, My card got declined 1 month and now Im being responsible for the full $12,900.I was never contacted,never talk to a agent notifying me about the situation even they said they tried to contact me which I believe is bs. What can i do?I cant afford $386 a mon",

The fact that the person has been turned in and the bond should have been returned to the bails person after that, should mean (in my mind) that you would not be obligated for the full balance. That makes no sense to me, but I am not familiar with the process of getting the bond amount returned when the defendant turned himself in.\n\nRobert Stempler (please see DISCLAIMER below)\nwww.StopCollectionLawsuits.com\nwww.facebook.com/SoCalConsumerLawyer\nTwitter: @RStempler"

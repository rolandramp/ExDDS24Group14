        "Yes. The automatic stay will kick in immediately after filing. If you get a discharge, you never have to pay the underlying debt. Best of luck and remember do not attempt BK on your own. There are many landmines. Get a BK lawyer. Best of luck.",

        "Yes if you file the bankruptcy before the summary judgment is issued and file a CM-180 notice of stay in the state court action.",
        "Yes, the summary judgment will be stopped (or suspended) once the case if filed, and if you stand to receive a chapter 7 discharge of the debt, then the lawsuit (MSJ) may be dismissed once the underlying debt/liability is extinguished (via Discharge).\n\nEnlist qualified local bankruptcy law firm/lawyer to assist and you may save yourself headache/stress/money in the long-run.\n\nBest of luck!\n\nMichael Salanick, Esq.\nwww.salanicklaw.com",
        "I agree with the other attorneys who say the BK will stop the MSJ and the suit, but want to add that sometimes creditors make fraud claims in addition to breach of contract claims. Fraud can be a reason for a lawsuit (\"adversary proceeding\" or \"AP\") in bankruptcy court, but that case would have to be timely brought in BK court, not in a state court or in the federal district court. Barring an AP, a BK will stop the MSJ and all collection efforts. You're welcome to contact me or any one of the fine Avvo lawyers who practice in the bankruptcy court for further assistance.",
        "Not only will it stop a summary judgment from being rendered, but it will also stop collection on that judgment if the case is filed after it's rendered.",
        "Yes.",
        "Absolutely. A Chapter 7 filing creates an automatic stay preventing any creditor listed in the Schedules and their agents, attorneys, etc, from doing anything to collect the debt. I am available for a free consultation if you want to discuss the particulars of your case.",
        "The automatic stay will temporarily halt the lawsuit. If you receive a discharge of this debt, the creditor will be permanently barred from trying to collect on the amount owed. At that point, the creditor should dismiss the lawsuit."

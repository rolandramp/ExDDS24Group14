        "You can not file another chapter 7 bankruptcy until eight years and a day since your last filing (Filing date, not discharge date). You can file a chapter 13 four years after a seven and then convert to a seven, but the expense and hassle may outweigh the advantage of filing a 13. See a bankruptcy attorney for details.",
        "You are not able to file another Chapter 7 until 8 years have passed following your FILING date of your 2011 Chapter 7. You may, however, file a small dollar monthly payment Chapter 13 and get a discharge of your dischargeable debt. Obviously, we do not know whether your EDD debt is dischargeable, since we do not know if they found that you obtained benefits fraudulently. You need to seek counsel ASAP from a local, experienced and well-reviewed attorney here on avvo.com. Use the Find a Lawyer tab. I am uncertain whether your county must go to San Jose, but there are great attorneys in the San Jose area. Get one who is active in NACBA, like Ike Schulman. God Bless You!"

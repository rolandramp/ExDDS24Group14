    "title": "CA homestead exemption allows $175K equity, 55 yrs with yearly income less than $25K. is it yearly or 6 month average?",
    "question": "i have a lot of equity in my home and would like to file chapter 7 system 1 bankruptcy. I'm over 55, single and have made less than $12,000 in the past 6 months, but if I include the entire 12 months income it would be over $25,000. California allows equity of $175,000 if income is less than $25,000 yearly, but the means test only asks for 6 months. Is it based on the true yearly income for the past 12 months or averaged by the 6 months prior annualized going forward?",
    "answers": [
        "The income required for homestead exemption is based on yearly income of less than $25,000. Unless thee was other income to take into consideration for the 6 month means test period, it wouldn't matter if it was averaged over 6 months or 12 months. The average for both would be the same. If the $25,000 isn't an average yearly income or it is not fixed income, trustee could object to your homestead exemption. Best not to take any chances. Consult with a bankruptcy attorney in your area.",
        "The means test is a bankruptcy construct created by Congress to calculate qualification for chapter 7 and length of a chapter 13 plan. It has no bearing on any other part of the bankruptcy.\nThe homestead exemption is California Law, and as such doesn't depend upon the bankruptcy for determination of time periods. 12 months determines the income level for exempting $175,000 in equity for a homestead."

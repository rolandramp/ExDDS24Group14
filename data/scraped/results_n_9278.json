        "Realistically, there probably won't be any major consequences for your ex-wife for not completing the Income and Expense Declaration completely. At the most, she might be sanctioned a very small amount of money. If it's her motion, it's possible you could argue for a dismissal of the OSC for failure to comply with Local Rules (if your county's local rules require a complete I&E).\n\nThe focus should be on how it affects you, rather than what trouble she might get in. Since the rental income is income, it should lower your spousal support obligation. Your job is to prove that the rental income exists in order to lower your support. With a hearing in 45 days, you will want to serve discovery on her immediately regarding her rental property. The easiest way for you to do this might be through the Judicial Council Form Interrogatories - Family Law. You can ask for tax returns and for her to fill out a new Schedule of Assets and Debts. If you have an attorney, your attorney would likely draft up a Request for Production of Documents and some Special Interrogatories. At the same time, do remember that it's very possible that her rental property is being rented out for less than the mortgage, and in that case, it's not income. You will definitely want to have all your facts lined up before the hearing, and you're lucky that you have enough time to do so.",
        "I respectfully disagree with the answer you were previously given. It is true that full disclosure of all assets (both community and separate) is required in an action for Dissolution of Marriage. It is also true that if a spouse fails to disclose a community property asset and even a separate property asset in their Schedule of Assets and Debts that a court may sanction that party by giving the entire asset to the other spouse. However, your question relates to an Income and Expense Declaration and not a Schedule of Assets and Debts. Your question does not relate to the non-disclosure of that asset, but rather the failure to list the income she receives from that asset. Moreover, it seems from your question that you are already divorced and that this is an OSC to modify support. Therefore, there are no assets remaining for the court to divide (unless somehow the court reserved jurisdiction over the division of property because that issue was not yet resolved at the time of the dissolution of your marriage).\n\nIf you look carefully at the Income and Expense Declaration, it requires that your ex-spouse bring to court a copy of her most recent income tax return. If your ex-spouse fails to bring her income tax return (which would include a statement relating to the income and expenses for that rental property) or the income she receives from it if the property is owned by a limited liability company or the like, the court would possibly take her testimony in order to make certain orders or more likely would continue the hearing in order for her to revise her Income and Expense Declaration and bring those materials to Court. In the interim, you might want to serve her with discovery in order for her to provide you with the underlying documentation she uses to calculate the final figures included in that tax return.\n\nThe response given is not intended to create, nor does it create an ongoing duty to respond to questions.

        "The entry \"09/12/2013: DECLARATION RE NON SERVICE OF SUMMONS/COMPL/NTC OF ASSIGNMENT/NTC OF OSC ON (name) FILED \" indicates plaintiff tried to serve you with a copy of the summons and complaint, but was unsuccessful. Plaintiff probably will try at least once more to serve you. If plaintiff is unsuccessful, it might dismiss the lawsuit \"without prejudice.\" If so, it might sue you again in the future or sell the debt for pennies on the dollar to a \"junk debt buyer,\" who might then sue you.\n\nKeep a vigilant eye on the docket. As soon as you see \"proof of service filed\" -- regardless whether you were actually served -- consult immediately with a debt collections defense attorney. (Or you can do that now.) Once you're served, you only have 30 days to file an answer; otherwise, plaintiff will obtain a default and default judgment against you.",
        "Go talk to a debt settlement or bankruptcy attorney regarding the status of your lawsuit. It appears the plaintiff has not moved for default judgment yet, therefore it is in your best interest to speak to an attorney soon.",
        "It is not clear what to do from this post, since your comment also states you have not been served.\nYou need to understand the circumstances.\nYou may wish to just observe, or to file an answer and get involved, or to file bankruptcy, all of which depends on many other facts such your assets, your other debts and your resources, as well as what you want to do when your choices are determined.\nThe usual advice is to present these facts to an attorney experienced in litigation defense, such as one listed by NACA (National Association of Consumer Attorneys), and/or NACBA (National Association of Consumer Bankruptcy Attorneys), and/or this AVVO website.\nGood Luck",
        "Call an attorney, because you question is unclear. These docket entries do not really explain what the status of your case is, there is a pending issue as to sanctions and the hearing is next August. It seems as though the ball is in their court now."

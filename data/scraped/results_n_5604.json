    "question": "According to the docket, I received my Chapter 7 discharge the day before the hearing. However, the motion for relief from stay was granted during the hearing the next day. Does the court still have jurisdiction to grant relief from stay if I already received my discharge?",

        "One of the reasons that there may be a hearing scheduled by a creditor's attorney even after the discharge is issued is because the bankruptcy trustee still has rights that your discharge does not affect. To foreclose they have to get relief from the automatic stay as to the Bankruptcy trustee. Sometimes the creditor's attorney still files even though the trustee has filed a statement of no asset. That is a waste. However, sometimes that is a good thing because the creditor waits for an order that they don't need, it means they may take even longer getting to a foreclosure sale.",
        "Yes this can happen. If you read the back of your Notice of Discharge it says the discharge \"is not a dismissal of the case.\" That means that it only relates to the discharge of your personal liability to pay the discharged debts. It also states \"However, a creditor may have the right to enforce a valid lien, such as a mortgage or security interest, against the debtor's property after the bankruptcy, if that lien was not avoided or eliminated in the bankruptcy case.\" That means the discharge also does not affect any related pending matters (such as a pending motion or adversary complaint). Your case will stay open until all of those pending matters are completed and then the clerk will issue the order closing your bankruptcy case.",
        "Say what? You received your Discharge the day before the 341 hearing? That is not possible. You need to double check your documents as the Discharge comes about 3 months after you file your petition.",
        "Sure, and it is common. The stay does not always terminate against all property at discharge. The stay can also be reimposed if necessary. Further, if a motion was filed and scheduled, of course the party filing the motion is not going to withdraw or abandon the motion since it is just as easy to get an order. There are many reasons a creditor would get the order, not including just to get paid. Finally, as far as jurisdiction, discharge never divests the court of jurisdiction. Cases can remain open for years after discharge, or the case may be closed the same day. It is the closing of the case that is the important date, and even then the Court can retain jurisdiction over matters in the case if it is reopened or a dispute arises.",
        "If you already received your discharge, the stay was already lifted; so the lawyer who filed the Motion so late was simply gen'g fees. The court does have jurisdiction to confirm that the stay has been lifted."

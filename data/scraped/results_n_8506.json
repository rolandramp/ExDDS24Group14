        "The best, and simplest thing, is just to call them and ask who their attorney is (or at least their lead attorney). They may try to talk their way around a question saying they are attorney backed or give you another reason as to why they cannot answer, but don't take no for an answer. Right now there are lots of firms doing debt settlement, if this one makes you think twice, go with a different one. This is a process that will take quite a bit of time (usually a few years), so make sure you're working with a company that will still be around and is reputable.\n\nOnce you receive the attorney name, you can do a quick bar search for misconduct.

        "When evaluating a law firm, you are wise to seek to look up its attorneys' profiles with the state bar association in order to make sure that the firm's attorneys are licensed and in good standing, and to avoid attorneys with a history of disciplinary action against them.\n\nA helpful site to locate additional information on businesses in general is the California Secretary of State's business portal (http://kepler.sos.ca.gov/cbs.aspx), which reflects that Valor Law Group is an active professional corporation formed in California a year ago in October 2009 (although please note that the Secretary's website does include a disclaimer stating that its data is not a complete or certified record of an entity).

    "title": "Do I need to hire a lawyer for identity theft?",
    "question": "I have just got notice that my wages will be garnished for a lawsuit that was established in Maryland in 2005. I have lived in California my whole life and when the case was brought to trial I was 17 years old. The person suing me is an apartment complex. I have tried to contact the lawyer that is listed on the wage garnishment form, and he told me that I need to fax him my social security card, drivers license and 3 signatures. I feel as if I have already had my identity stolen Is this the only way to prevent them from garnishing my wages? Should I hire an lawyer to countersuit this company for not doing their due diligence when locating the defendent.",

        "First, do what's asked to stop the garningment, then consider whether what they did was negligent enough for a lawsuit. Tell the lawyer that if faxing the information the lawyer has asked you for doesn't immediately stop this garnihsment, you'll hire your own lawyer and hold them responsible for your damages, including these legal fees. If this solves the problem, then you really have no damages to sue for.\n\nDisclaimer: Please note that this answer does not constitute legal advice, and should not be relied on, since each state has different laws, each situation is fact specific, and it is impossible to evaluate a legal problem without a comprehensive consultation and review of all the facts and documents at issue. This answer does not create an attorney-client relationship.",
        "I would NEVER give them the last four numbers of my S.S.N. to any debt collector.\n\nSend them your partial SSN (with last four numbers blacked out), DL (with DL No. blacked out), and three signatures via fax/email and FOLLOW UP by sending the info. via certified mail / return receipt requested so they can't claim they don't know. Include a statement that you have always lived in Calif.\n\nI'd also send a copy directly to the company that is trying to garnish you. They might attempt to sell the judgment when they can't find the person who owes it.\n\nCheck your credit reports. If someone stole your identity, you may (or may not) be able to identify other accounts which are not yours, addresses that you never lived at, or even \"alternate\" SSN's. All of these are read flags.\n\nI am not licensed in Calif. and am not familiar with your state's collection practices laws. You should call an experienced consumer protection attorney in your area. This is intended as consumer friendly advice and not legal advice or to establish an attorney-client relationship. Good luck!"

        "It sounds like maybe the school is trying to collect on a debt that is different than your federal student loans, such as maybe for books, housing, or something else at the school. If true, it is probably a dischargeable debt (unlike your federal loans). If it is dischargeable, whether you are obligated to pay depends on when/if the statute of limitations has run. I suggest you run the details by an Avvo consumer protection attorney -- most of us do not charge for our services.",
        "The general rule is student loans are not dischargeable in bankruptcy, but there are exceptions. I agree you need to have a student loan expert review your paperwork. I recommend Avvo lawyer D.J. Rausa.\n\nYou state that you have been making payments on the Marinello debt. The Statute of Limitations (SoL) for a written contract in CA is 4 years from the date of your last payment. Perhaps you lost your SOL defense on an 8 year old debt because of that. Sorry I can't give you better news. To get another opinion, find/consult/hire a lawyer in your area using the Avvo feature \"Find a Lawyer\". Make a list of 4-5 having many 5 star reviews from satisfied clients. If you don't get a prompt call back from one, go on to the next on your list. Some offer a free consultation by phone or in person. Take us up on it. Good luck & God bless.",

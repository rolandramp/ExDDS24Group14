        "Your H1B status is operative when you are working in the US. You do not lose the quota or the H1B when you are outside the United States. Therefore, if you are working outside US, your H1B does not get revoked unless the company employing you revokes the H1B. If they revoke the H1B, you can still transfer to another company without having to go through the quota unless you have completed the 6 years and you do not have a 365 days pending labor certification or an approved I-140. Note that time spent outside or on H4 do not count towards the six years.(Time spent outside can be recaptured) For more details about your case, please call a good immigration lawyer familiar with employment based immigration.\n\nYou can read more on H1B on our website.

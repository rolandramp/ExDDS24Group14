        "I agree with my colleagues. The time to transfer this into joint tenancy passed when your mother did. Probate is now required. You should consult with an attorney to see if it makes financial sense to do this, given the apparent low equity in the property. You are in a bit of a Catch-22. The lender will not deal with you unless you file for probate. But until you know what the lender is going to agree to, (if anything), it is hard to say whether the costs of probate would be justified.\n\nJames Frederick",
        "You can't do this as your name wasn't on the deed. You will need to probate the estate to get distribution to you of the house. My office can help.",
        "You can only file an affidavit of death of joint tenant if you owned the property with your mother in joint tenancy. Based upon your description, your mother was the sole owner and you were not on title as a joint tenant. This means the house must go through probate. If you want to save the house, I suggest you hire a probate attorney ASAP to get the process going, as the process will take at least 6 months, and in the meantime work with the lender to see if they will work together with you to give a modification. You will likely have to be able to qualify for the loan yourself. If you cannot, at least you can sell the house through probate and possibly get some money out of any equity, instead of losing the house all together. Good luck.",
        "I am sorry for your loss.\n\nI think that you may be referring to an Affidavit of Death of Joint Tenant. However, this document would only be used if you and your mother own the real property as joint tenants. In that event, you would file such an affidavit in order to take title in your name.\n\nAre you your mother's only heir? Did your mother have a trust or a will? If the property is not in a trust, and your mother is the sole owner of the house, and her real and personal property, has a gross value of more than $150,000.00, you will need to file a Petition in Probate in order to obtain title to the home. The gross value of an estate does not include the mortgage on the property. Also when determining the value of the estate, do not include anything held in joint tenancy or anything that is paid-on-death (such as life insurance, bank accounts with a named beneficiary etc.). If you are the only heir, then you would receive the house and could retitle it in your name, at the end of Probate.",
        "No. You cannot establish a joint tenancy after the title holder has passed away. You will have to open a probate. If you qualify for a loan on your own terms, you can refinance the house.",
        "It would indeed be an unusual twist of the law if you could unilaterally create a joint tenancy. Almost certainly the owner of this home is the estate of your mother and some form of probate procedure will be needed to effect a legal transfer. That process will necessarily involve any will, all heirs and/or beneficiaries, and settlement of mother's debts. Navigating this area of law will almost certainly require the assistance of experienced probate counsel.\n\nBest wishes for an outcome you can accept, and please remember to designate a best answer."

        "You are referring to \"preliminary\" and \"final\" declarations of disclosure. These are hugely important documents in California law! They are in fact, as you have observed, the same forms. The language has to do with timing. Preliminary declarations are prepared and delivered at the beginning of the divorce case, and to give the other party a full disclosure of all assets and debts at the time the divorce is filed. Divorces take time to complete, and it is anticipated that the information in the preliminary disclosure will change with the passage of that time. The final declarations are completed and delivered at the time the cases settles or when it goes to trial, to ensure that the other party has accurate information as of that later point in time.\n\nIt is important to note that preliminary declarations of disclosure cannot be waived or avoided. They must be complete before your judge can sign-off of the final divorce judgment (aka decree). If you don't do them, you will not get divorced.\n\nComplete disclosure is also imperative. If you withhold information from the disclosures, of intentionally provide misleading information the judge can punish you by making a disproportionate award of property or debt.\n\nDisclosures are not to be taken lightly. Unfortunately there are no shortcuts!"

    "title": "Can California family code 4011 be made retroactive?",
    "question": "My ex wife had lent her ex husband money and he had repaid some of the loan, but not all. They recently had a hearing to set child support arrears. At the hearing the ex's counsel claimed that the loan repayments should be applied to past due support per FC 4011. That does not seem accurate or my wife could go to all of his creditors and claim they owe her money for support because child support payments should be made before payments to creditors.",
    "answers": [
        "It appears that the argument would be that the ex husband still owes the loan, and the payments were for support, not the loan. It depends on how the court will interpret the payments. Without more information it is impossible to advise you.\n\nIs this a contempt proceeding? Is the a proceeding to determine arrears?",
        "Hello,\n\nThis is an interesting question. This case is not published but it should give you some ideas on how to proceed. The unpublished case is IN RE MARRIAGE OF JASSO, Cal: Court of Appeal, 4th Appellate Dist., 1st Div. 2009. The relative portion of this case states,\n\n\"Family Code section 4011 provides: \"Payment of child support ordered by the court shall be made by the person owing the support payment before payment of any debts owed to creditors.\" By its terms, this provision applies to the conduct of a child support debtor, imposing an obligation on the debtor to first satisfy a child support debt before satisfying other debts.\n\nThe provision does not impose on a trial court a duty to characterize a payment by a debtor to a creditor as a child support payment when the evidence demonstrates that the payment was not child support.\"",
        "There is no reason I can think of why a competent judge would buy that argument. if you want legal research to back it up--HIRE AN ATTORNEY. Limited representation. On here you will get what you pay fot. (P.S. The Walmart model does not apply to law.)",
        "That sound you hear is me scratching my head...\n\nYou haven't really described the situation very clearly. You says that the \"ex's counsel claimed\" but since you referred to both parents as \"exes\" it is not so obvious whom you're talking about.\n\nIf the dad owed both child support arrears and debt payments, then the payments MUST be credited toward the child support first. That is the very point of FC 4011.\n\nAnd by virtue of the fact that this code section refers, specifically, to prioritizing child support over debt payments, it can only be interpreted as being applied \"retroactively\"."

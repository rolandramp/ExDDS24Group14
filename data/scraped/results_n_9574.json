    "title": "How expensive of a car can you reaffirm during a chapter 7 BK? Will the monthly payment (about $1100) disqualify us from filing?",
    "question": "I want to keep a car worth about $76K that I really worked hard for. I leased it several months before filing for ch.7. Would I be able to reaffirm the lease without being disqualified from filing the ch. 7 BK? I don't know how CA law relates to vehicle exemptions. I have not even made the first payment on the vehicle. Please advise!!!! Thanks.",

        "\"Wait a minute\" (this is how the trustee is going to see it). You knew you were having financial problems (BK doesn't happen overnight) and you went out right before filing bankruptcy and leased a $76,000 car?\n\nI think you should be looking at your priorities first - what is your gross income? Are you even eligible for bankruptcy - you usually have to have high income to qualify for a $1,100/month lease payment.\n\nIf there is no practical equity in the car, it's usually exempt. However, to reaffirm the debt you are either going to have to get a judge to go along with it (if you are filing yourself) or get your attorney to sign off.\n\nI'd say - talk to an attorney if you are really thinking of filing bankruptcy right away - right now, as a BK attorney, I see a big red flag that needs to be dealt with immediately.\n\nGood luck with your situation. The above is general information and not specific advice since I don't know your income, expenses, assets, debts etc.\n\nMatthew Williamson\nwww.MontereyBayBankruptcy.com"

        "Whether you are proceeding by 'default' or as an uncontested action depends on whether the other party filed a response to the petition for dissolution of marriage. If she has not responded, then you are proceeding by default (you should have also filed a request to enter default), and you should check the default box (B if you have a signed agreement and A if you do not). Otherwise, you should check C.\n\nWhether the other two pages are left blank depends on the issues that were possibly before the court, not what happened to them. So if you agreed that your community assets have been awarded one way or the other, or that spousal support has been waived, you should still check these boxes.\n\nBest of luck to you.",

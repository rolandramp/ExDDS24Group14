    "title": "Do my tenants need to pay rent after filing for chapter 7 bankruptcy? Do I need to do anything if they've paid timely?",
    "question": "My tenants have always been on time with their rent payments. Recently I just received notice that they filed for chapter 7 bankruptcy. Since they have not violated any terms of the lease I don't believe that I can or need to take any actions against them. The lease is now month to month. Am I allowed to just talk to them about their future plans as to staying or leaving? Obviously I won't be talking about money because they have paid all their rent. Would I be violating the \"automatic stay\"? They are elderly nice people who are in a difficult situation and I would like to give them the benefit of doubt but also want to protect my rights and my family. We do need to have the rent to continue to pay the mortgage on the rental property.",

        "I agree that you should be able to ask their intentions regarding whether they will stay or intend to leave, but if you feel uncomfortable you could attend the Meeting of Creditors and appear as a creditor when their case is called and ask them what you need to ask them during their hearing.",
        "Your tenants who have file chapter 7, will need to pay rent, if they want to stay as your tenants.\n\nYou certainly can inquire as to their intentions, and, you can find out on your own, by reviewing their filed schedule G, to see if they reported whether or not they intend to retain the lease with you.\n\nIt is likely they want to stay, because they now can better afford to pay the rent, without other creditors bothering them.",
        "It is fine to limit your conversation with the debtors about their intentions and you can easily obtain this information by looking at Schedule G and the Statement of Intention.",
        "You're right you don't need to take any action against them or attend the creditors meeting unless they owe you rent. Of course you are allowed to inquire if they wish to stay in the apartment. Chances are, that their reasons for filing the bankruptcy have to do with their debts and not their rental agreement with you. It's just that they are required by bankrutpcy rules to list in their schedules any unexpired leases they hold and that is why you were listed on the petition and received the notice. Hopefully the discharge will help them be in a better position to afford their rent & other living expenses."

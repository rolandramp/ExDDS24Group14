    "title": "I am thinking of filing bankruptcy due to my husband losing his job because of a disability. What debt is included?",
    "question": "We have about $20k in credit card debt, $2,500 personal loan, car payment (which I plan on continuing to pay if I do file bankruptcy because it's our only car) and state taxes. If I understand correctly, if I do file bankruptcy, the credit card and personal loan debt would go away. Is that correct?",
    "answers": [
        "Those debts sound like they would be dischargeable. The taxes may or may not be. Contact an attorney. In this area you do get what you pay for and experience is key. There are plenty of attorneys on Avvo with lots of positive client reviews. Making the call is the hardest and most important step.",
        "I'm sorry that you are going through a hard time. Generally speaking, you can discharge (wipeout) credit card debts and personal loans in a bankruptcy. Additionally, under certain circumstances income tax debts are also dischargeable in bankruptcy. You should consult with a local attorney. Many of my colleagues and I give free consultations.",
        "Having been a bankruptcy attorney for over 40 years...and based on your question I would agree that you and your husband will probably qualify for a Chapter 7 bankruptcy. To be certain, I would need to know your pay information and whether your husband is/will be receiving disability payments. Yes, you would receive a discharge of your credit card debt and the personal loan. You also will receive a personal discharge of the remaining balance on your car. Signing a reaffirmation agreement and making the payments will insure that you keep your car while at the same time improving your credit if you make those payments timely. Would need additional info as to the state taxes to determine if they might be dischargeable.",
        "General answer is most unsecured debts which did not have any fraud attached to them. If you inflated your income by massive amounts or do not disclose important facts that would prevent a discharge in most circumstances. As for taxes you might be able to discharge them as well. I suggest that you meet with an experienced bankruptcy attorney right away to discuss.",
        "I am sorry to learn about your ordeal. I concur with the recommendations of my distinguished colleagues. They have informed you of everything that you need to do. Use AVVO's Find a Lawyer tool to select a qualified attorney. Good luck.",
        "When you set up contact with a BK attorney, don't be afraid to shop around. Not only for the best price, but for the expertise, prompt call backs, ease of understanding you and answering your questions. If you don't get this treatment, keep looking. Best of luck to you. There are some SD BK lawyers offering free consultations. Use that opportunity to check them out. Whatever you do, avoid the temptation to be your own lawyer. BK is a minefield for the unwary. Checking the wrong box can be like stepping on a landmine. Also, avoid the so-called 'typing services' offering low prices. They cannot give legal advice, but sometimes they do. They are not licensed to act as an attorney even though they may tout lots of experience. Good luck to you."

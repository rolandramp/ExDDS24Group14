    "answers": [
        "Assuming that you filed a Chapter 7 five years ago, you would have to wait another three years to file another Chapter 7. If that is not an option, you would be able to file a Chapter 13. In a Chapter 13 you are required to pay of a portion or all of your debt in monthly payments to the Chapter 13 Trustee over a period of three to five years. This situation is colloquially referred to as a \"Chapter 20\" (7+13) and is very common. Before moving forward you should consider the fact that unrepresented debtors in Chapter 13 have a 99% rate of failure. I would advise meeting with an attorney who handles Chapter 13s as they are much more complex than a Chapter 7. Additionally, if costs are a consideration, in a Chapter 13 you are able to pay your attorneys fees \"through the plan\".",
        "From the question it is not clear if the former bankruptcy was filed under Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 and if the former bankruptcy ended with discharge. Assuming that it was filed under Chapter 7 and ended with a discharge, you can now file a petition under Chapter 13 and get a discharge. You will not be able to get a discharge in another Chapter 7. There is waiting period of 8 years between two chapter 7 bankruptcies and waiting period of four years between Chapter 7 and Chapter 13. Again, in order to provide a full response, there is need for more facts. I strongly suggest that you talk to a local attorney regarding your bankruptcy. Most attorneys provide some type of a free initial consultation.",
        "There is nothing stopping you from filing either a Chapter 7 or a Chapter 13, but you won't receive a discharge in a Chapter 7 filed within 8 years of a previous Chapter 7, or a Chapter 13 filed within 4 years of a previous Chapter 7, or a Chapter 7 filed within 6 years of a Chapter 13 in which there was a discharge UNLESS:\nPayments = 100% of secured claims\nOR\nPayments = 70% of secured claims and the plan was proposed in good faith by the debtor and was his best efforts",
        "If the first BK was a Chapter 7, another Chapter 7 cannot be filed until 8 yrs have passed from the filing date. However, if you want a discharge of debts, a new Chapter 13 can be filed after 4 years have passed from the filing date of the first BK. A Chapter 13 can immediately follow a Chapter 7 if the new Chapter 13 provides for full payment of the debts. There are some other \"wrinkles\" but that is the timing. Remember, BK is not a DIY project. Click the Avvo tab \"Find a Lawyer:. Many of us offer free consultations.",
        "they could file a chapter 13, but not a chapter 7. You can file a chapter 7 after 8 years and a chapter 13 after 4. Actually you can file a chapter 13 anytime, you just don't receive a discharge unless its been 4 years."

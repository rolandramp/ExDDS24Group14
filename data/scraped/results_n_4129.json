    "title": "Can my ch. 7 bankruptcy backfire if I add a new line 2 my cell company with a new upgraded phone w/ contract then file on them?",
    "question": "Don't own a house only own one vehicle, and am on state disability atm. My ch. 7 has been filled and I go to court in three weeks for it, I've been told I can add debt to it before then but will this be frowned upon if I get a new phone from them with a 2/ year contract and file against my whole plan with Verizon wireless?",

        "Eitther you misunderstood what your lawyer said or s/he lacks bankruptcy experience. You can add creditors you forgot to your bankruptcy if they were made BEFORE you filed, but what you propose is virtually robbing a vendor using a pen instead of a gun. You can't believe this is ok! Hope this perspective helps!",
        "When you say \"I've been told...\" was that a lawyer? You seem to not understand Ch. 7 even though you filled. Since you have already filed, any debt you incur from this point on is your debt to deal with. You can't incur more debt and then \"file on them.\" In addition, even if you did the contract before filing, you would lose your service going forward unless you could pay for it. Finally, had you incurred a lot of debt just before filing, the creditor could file a complaint to except it from your discharge.",
        "Only debts incurred prior to the filing of the bankruptcy are potentionally dischargeable.",
        "I am in agreement with all the other attorney responses but I want to add - why would you do that? What sense does it make to do this - is it just so you can get a new phone? That will probably only work with Verizon coverage? I just don't think this makes any sense and like the other attorneys said, if you do this after the day your bankruptcy was filed, the contract obligation will not be included in your discharge.",
        "When you file a Chapter 7 bankruptcy, that bankruptcy will only discharge debts you incurred before the date you filed. Any debts you incurred after the date you filed will not be \"touched\" by the bankruptcy. In other words, the new debts you incurred post-filing will not be discharged by the bankruptcy.\n\nAs for your new cell phone contract, you cannot add it to your bankruptcy since it was entered into post-filing. Just go ahead and keep paying on it, and you should have no problem.",
        "No bankruptcy attorney will advise you that you can add a new debt post petition and discharge it in a ch 7! If one did, fire them...as it is not true! So I am guessing a non attorney told you that. Any old contract will be wipe off. So go get a new plan that you want..you are not bound by old one..get a better payment plan etc. However, if you like current plan, keep on paying it if you like it. Your provider may have been notified depending on if you listed that debt in bankruptcy. Technically your contract with them is a debt so even if no monies owed you can list..many do not if current. Good luck."

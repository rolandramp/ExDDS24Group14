    "title": "Can you amend an abstract of judgment to increase the amount of the judgment?",
    "question": "If you receive a judgment with a monetary component and a motion for attorney's fees is pending, can you record an abstract of judgment now and amend it later to include the attorney's fees if they are awarded?",
    "answers": [
        "Agreed with counsel who observes that the judgment is amended by court order. After that occurs, you can obtain the amended abstract with the new amount. The original judgment may state in it \"$X principal plus attorneys fees.\" Arguably, in that case, there is no need to amend the abstract since the judgment reflected in the original abstract includes the attorneys fees. However, as a practical matter, if one wants the word and title companies to know how much the pay off is for the abstract, best to get an amended abstract and record it.\n\nThis is technical matter and you probably should have an attorney help you with it.",
        "You cannot amend it. The court must amend the judgment. You can file a motion, requesting entry of a specific court order.",
        "you can.",
        "Yes, you can.",
        "Yes."

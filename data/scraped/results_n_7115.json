    "question": "A credit card company says they plan to sue me if I don't pay them. I can't pay, and plan to file Chapter 7 bankruptcy, but probably not for another 6 months or so. If they get a default judgment now, will a bankruptcy discharge it at a later date?",

        "Yes a default judgment is dischargeable in bankruptcy. However, if this aggressive creditor is taking the effort to obtain a judgment it is safe to assume that this creditor will proceed to record a lien against your property. If a lien is recorded and if you do not have it remove with a 522 motion during bankruptcy, then the lien will survive bankruptcy.\n\nMost consumer bankruptcy attorneys offer free consultation, my office does as well, and we serve Riverside Division with our Riverside office which is where you will be filing if you need to file bankruptcy. You really should consult an attorney in the area and discuss the best course of action. It is best to be proactive.",
        "Even though your house has no equity, if the creditor does sue you & obtains a judgment, that judgment can be expensive to remove in your bankruptcy. Although you might expect that homestead laws will protect you, the protection a homestead provides is limited to a forced sale of your property. If the creditor records the judgment, it will become a lien affecting any property you own. Sure, the creditor can't force the sale of your property, but when you go to refinance or sell, you will have to pay off the lien or have it removed through the bankruptcy.\n\nHope this perspective helps!",

    "question": "How do I write a revocation of voluntary wage assignment letter. I was told if I do this they will stop the garnishment?",
    "answers": [
        "If you gave a creditor permission to deduct money directly from your paycheck or bank account and you want it to stop you need to send the creditor a letter stating that you no longer wish to have money deducted from your pay. If they have judgment against you they can file a garnishmment with the court to start the deductions from your pay again.",
        "If you are being garnished by a creditor, it is being done by court order. You can stop it by exempting the asset being garnished or by having grounds to fight it in court. If the government is garnishing you for something through statutory authority, then you need to contact that agency and try to settle with them to stop it.\n\nWho told you this?\n\n[This communication is intended as general information and not specific legal advice, and this communication does not create an attorney-client relationship. I am only licensed in the Commonwealth of Virginia.]",
        "I am somewhat unclear what you mean. To whom and in what context did you sign a letter that allows someone to take a portion of your wages? Is this a civil case, taxes, or a family law matter? Do you know if a judgment was entered and if so, did the court grant an earnings withholding order? Also, is the other party a debt collector or a creditor? These are the questions I would need answer to take a shot at responding to your posting. Perhaps you can provide an additional posting.\n\nIf you want to revoke something, perhaps you can send a letter by certified mail, return receipt requested to the other side's attorney stating, \"I revoke the voluntary wage assignment. Stop taking my wages, effective immediately.\" Something to this effect."

    "title": "Can someone else sue for a debt that was already won in a judgment, but then the defendant filed for bankruptcy and included it?",
    "question": "Me and my wife, along with my sister-in-law and her husband rented a house. All 4 adults were on the contract. The landlord and his wife were both on the contract. They illegally kept our security deposit. I personally sued him and won a judgment. He and his wife just filed for bankruptcy. Since my sister-in-law and the landlord's wife were not included in the judgment, can my sister-in-law legally sue her after the bankruptcy to try and get our money back? Not trying to be petty, but this guy was HORRIBLE to us, stole our money, and is doing everything he can to not pay us back. This person is trying to claim both his residence and the rental home as personal residences so he doesn't lose them, is a VP of his company, and is most likely hiding other big assets. Is this a lost cause??",

        "You should contact a bankruptcy attorney in your area to determine creditor rights. You may be entitled to some funds if the trustee to the landlord's bankruptcy case is able to acquire assets. Alternatively, you may want to file an adversarial proceeding claiming possible fraud. Talking to a creditors rights attorney in person will help you to better understand possible options. The attorney will also be able to look up the case and analyze the situation better.\n\nIf the bankruptcy did not have any assets, your sister-in-law will not be able to collect any money. Although they didn't receive notice of the bankruptcy, if the case is \"no asset\", then they would not have received anything anyways and they still will not receive anything.\n\nI'm sorry for your loss and having to deal with the guy. Good luck.",
        "It is unlikely that other parties to the contract can pursue him for a debt that the court has already rendered judgment.

But if your judgment was only for 1/4 of the damages, then they may have a claim. It matters a lot to find out if they filed Chapter 7 or 13. As a general rule, any debt incurred prior to filing the BK is dischargeable debt. If this guy's BK is a Chapter 7 \"no asset\" case, no one will have claim to collect for past debt (some exceptions for fraud and other criminal acts).

        "I agree with Ms. Ware's answer above generally.

        "According to responses from my colleagues, here is what this means: \"The amount of the new homestead exemption that becomes effective January 1, 2021 is the greater of $300,000 or the countywide median sale price of a single-family home in the calendar year prior to the calendar year in which the judgment debtor claims the exemption, not to exceed $600,000. There is a single amount countywide, no longer tied to marital status, number of dependents, age, disability or income.\"\n\n\"According to the Los Angeles Times in an article published October 21, 2020, in Los Angeles County, the median sales price rose 14.5% from a year earlier to $710,000. That would result in Los Angeles County residents being entitled to the maximum exemption of $600,000.\"\n\n\"This only applies, however, to properties purchased more than 1215 days (approximately 3.3 years) prior to the filing of the bankruptcy case and it is important that the funds paid for the home not have come from an otherwise avoidable transfer. For example, you can't just take $200,000 sitting in your bank account now and pay down your mortgage just to protect the $200,000 with the new higher exemption.\"",
        "It is true. The homestead increases from a low of $300K to a high of $600K.\n\nIt is unclear if this is automatic (that would make sense, but I have not seen an analysis that says so). So if you are looking to file BK, or think you may be foreclosed on by the court (as opposed to Sheriff/trustee sale), you should consider filing a Declaration of Homestead with the County Recorder.\n\nGood luck.",
        "Yes, the state legislature did pass the bill increasing state exemptions, and it was signed into law by the Governor. Los Angeles County will likely qualify for the maximum $600,000 because the median home sale price is above that amount during 2020. Yes, it is effective Jan. 1, 2020.",

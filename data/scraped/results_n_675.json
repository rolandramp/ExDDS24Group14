        "In addition to the answers from the other attorneys, keep in mind there are powerful state and federal laws that protect you. Among other things, Creditors and debt collectors are prohibited from harassing you with repeated calls, abusing you, deceiving you, and/or making you feel oppressed or humiliated. If creditors or collection agencies are violating your rights, you could be entitled to compensation. I suggest you reach out to a consumer protection attorney to discuss your situation.",
        "No but there are lawyers who will review all of your collection letters for free and file a case for you if you’ve been the victim of illegal collection attempts! Get your situation checked out for free now.",
        "Another route to consider is filing bankruptcy. If you have credit cards that are already past due then filing bankruptcy may not drop your credit score that much. Bankruptcy wipes out most debts and provides you a fresh start. I suggest you consult with a bankruptcy attorney so you know your options.",
        "Sure, you can try. Settling with installments is not a common arrangement when settling credit card debt. Think about it for a second. (1) Before they will entertain any settlement, you must default on payments. (2) You will have then not made the installment payments you originally agreed to make, (3) Why would they turn around and offer you a reduced balance and then allow you pay it in installments (which you already didn't do originally. Your promise to make payments \"this time\" doesn't hold water.\n\nRealistically, we have been able to do negotiate installments in 2 situations (a), high balance private student loans, and (2) when the debtor has been sued. In the latter scenario, you can offer a stipulated (or deferred( judgment as security for the payment plan.\n\nYour primary leverage when settling debt is that money now is more valuable than money over time.

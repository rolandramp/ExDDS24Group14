        "Serve the Subpoena with the ORAP. The Sheriff will charge an extra fee. Private process servers are negotiable. If he/she appears at the exam without every single document, you can ask questions and then have the debtor return to complete the examination, bringing the rest of the documents. Make you list specific. Do not be purposely burdensome, but be thorough. A rifle may be better than a shotgun.",
        "You're correct. You use the Subp-002 form, but make sure you attach a typed out list of the actual documents that you want the debtor to bring. This list can be as long and as detailed as you want. Also, since you're going to a debtor's exam, make sure to bring a bench warrant form with you (in case the debtor doesn't show up). If the debtor doesn't show, you can immediately request that the court sign the bench warrant for the debtor's arrest. When that happens, the debtor listens."

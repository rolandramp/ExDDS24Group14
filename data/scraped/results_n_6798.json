    "title": "Civil suit after bankruptcy chapter 7 discharge?",
    "question": "I had a business and I personally guaranteed the lease on the space the business was using. Business went under and I fell behind on my rent payments. I then filed chapter 7 bk on the business, where I included the lease. I also filed chapter 7 bk personal with the lease included. Both cases are discharged.",

        "In over 30 years of practicing bankruptcy law, I haven't run into a situation where a creditor did something this stupid! I have to wonder why. Is the landlord represented? Was the landlord aware of your bankruptcy?\n\nThe bankruptcy discharge is a defense to the lawsuit. The creditor may owe you a ton of money for violating the bankruptcy discharge by filing this suit. Contact your bankruptcy attorney to pursue this matter.\n\nHope this perspective helps!",
        "This case is going to turn on notice. If they did not get notice either by mail or in person, then you would only have to give notice to stop the proceeding.\n\nIf they knew, you could get them for sanctions for violating bankruptcy law.",
        "The debt was discharged by the bankruptcy. The lawsuit is a violation of the discharge injunction. Contact the attorney who represented you in the case immediately. He could reopen the case and go after sanctions against the landlord. The only question I would have is are you still in the property? If so, the landlord can file suit to evict you from the property and that would not violate the discharge injunction however, if not then he is violating the discharge injunction."

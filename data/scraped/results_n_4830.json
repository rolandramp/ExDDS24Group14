    "title": "Is a past due college account subject to Statute of Limitations?",
    "question": "Charges are from 7.5 years ago and I am just now hearing about it. The account is with a community college. I know Student loans are not dischargeable through a SoL or Chapter 7 but this is simply a past due account with the community college. I am wondering if this makes such accounts subject to statute of limitations. In addition the account hasn't shown up on my credit report. I know that there is only so long they have to report collection accounts to the credit agencies. Does anyone know if they can still report it after so much time has past?",

        "As stated Student loans are not SOL, but you said that these are not student loans. If they are charges what kind of charges? credit purchases? what were the purchases? How did you hear about it if it was not reported on your credit? Did the school contact you? when was the last activity? when did you last pay if ever?\nThe school can possibly withhold transcripts and such until it is paid.\nJust because they don't report it does not mean that it is not a debt. Reporting is just reporting, 7 years is usually the reporting period but if any qualified activity occurs like charges or a debt collector buys it, it can be reportable. Try sending them a letter if they are contacting you stating that the debts last activity was beyond SOL. If they are trying to collect a noncollectable debt the MAY be in violation but we need more facts to decide that.\nRemember to watch out for the incredibly nasty \"account stated\" option debt buyers use, they will send you a letter with a statement of the account, if you fail to respond you are \"accepting\" the debt (its not quite that simple but you get the idea).\ngood luck, hope these at least focused your issue.",

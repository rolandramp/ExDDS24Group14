    "question": "Hello, I recently went to refinance my home when the title company discovered two liens. One form the DOJ due to a federal restitution out standing balance and the other from a debt collector. The debt from the debt collector however was already accounted for in my restitution order. If the debt is part of my restitution how can the collector also put a lien on my home.? How can I get the lien removed?",

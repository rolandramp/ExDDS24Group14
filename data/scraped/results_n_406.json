        "Yes, you can file at anytime - now (when you were served the summons) or even later (after they get the judgment). The debt will be discharged. The sooner you file though, the sooner the collection action will stop.",
        "Yes, it's important to send special, separate notices to the creditor, its attorneys, and the state court in which the action is pending, that the bankruptcy petition was filed.\n\nI would file the Judicial Council form in the Superior Court, with a copy of the notice from the Clerk of the Bankruptcy Court, and mail a copy to the attorneys for the creditor.",
        "Absolutely you can file, but don't dither. If the suit goes to judgment and you own real estate you culd have a lien filed against the real estate and to remove it will significantly increase the cost of the bankruptcy. See a bankruptcy attorney for more details.",
        "Yes, you can file bankruptcy while a civil case is still pending. The civil case will be stayed upon the filing."

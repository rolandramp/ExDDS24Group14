    "question": "I had a Ch. 7 341 meeting and a person for the Office of the US Trustee showed up and interrogated me about my income as well as a vehicle I acquired to replace a vehicle I was surrendering. He asked my atty to do another means test and the trustee continued hearing for another date. I was caught completely off guard. Should I be worried?",

        "Oftentimes the UST will show up when there are questions. Maybe you had a big bonus so your 6 month average is not in line with your schedule I. This often raises questions. It could be they are not sure about your ability to file a chapter 7 - I realize this is not a comforting answer, but it is their job to make sure that your bankruptcy is accurate. You and your attorney will likely have to turn over further documentation to answer their questions, but likely that should be the entirety of it.",
        "Get with your attorney, and overhaul your Means Test form, if revisions to the form are required. The Means Test Form shows at the end if you pass or fail the Means Test. You will then know if you can stay in a Chapter 7 case, or if you must convert your case to a Chapter 13 case. You need to be concerned, but do not panic. You may redo the Means Test form, and have your second hearing, and the U.S. Trustee may be satisfied with your representations on the form, and your answers in court. Provide recent pay stubs and other documentation to back up changes you made on the Means Test form.",
        "Maybe. If the Means Test needs to be done over, you may not qualify for a chapter 7. The case may have to be converted to Chapter 13 if you have disposable income under that test. These are questions for your lawyer or another lawyer who knows how to prepare a Means Test.",
        "Maybe. Talk to your attorney about these issues. HE can run a new means test to see if you have a problem. You are probably OK on the car replacement, but talk to your attorney about that too.",
        "I concur with the advice offered by my colleagues. Your own atty is the best person to discuss this matter with.",
        "I am glad you have an attorney. The US Trustee shows up when they suspect there is substantial abuse. If you have not abused the system, your attorney can fix the problem with some timely amendments.",
        "You need to discuss the issues with our attorney. You have not supplied enough information for any other attorney to be able to formulate a valuable response.",
        "Not necessarily. The UST reviews some cases randomly. The Means Test result can be affected by secured debt such as vehicle ownership and some debtors \"load up\" on secured debt prior to filing merely to bypass having a presumption of abuse arise under the Means Test. Some debtors make errors when calculating income and completing the Means Test. If you don't already have an attorney, you should consult with one who can review your filing and make sure that you have completed your forms and calculations properly.",
        "Maybe a little, you should talk to your own attorney. Obviously, the representative from the US trustees office thinks there's some kind of issue with your income and expenses and qualifying under the means test. Can't really guess without having seen the exchange at your 3:41 a.m. meeting."

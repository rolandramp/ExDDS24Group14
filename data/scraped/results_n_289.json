        "Did you know that, as a result of the Coronavirus pandemic, you can enroll in Covered California right now. Even if you thought you could not afford coverage before, check again, talk to a Covered California agent. If you have a modest income from your business which is too high to qualify for Medi-Cal, see if you can enroll in a \"Silver\" plan through Covered California. Please check into this and get yourself covered! Don't \"put the cart before the horse\" and assume that the only option is to file a bankruptcy case!",

        "I'm sorry to hear about your health condition. I hope that you will get better soon.\nTo answer your question, you might have to sell your business under bankruptcy. If you file a chapter 7 bankruptcy, then probably you will have to liquidate your business to pay off creditors. If you file a Chapter 11 or 13, you will ask the court to reorganize your debt, maybe lower it or extend the payment period for creditors. Since you want to keep a sole proprietorship, you probably want to seek a chapter 13 bankruptcy to extend the payoff period. To be eligible for chapter 13: you must have less than $394,725 in unsecured debt and secured debts are less than $1,184,200.\nI hope that helps."

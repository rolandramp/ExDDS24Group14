    "title": "Can I write off bad debt from an unpaid loan given to a family member and receive a tax deduction ?",
    "question": "Over the past 12 years I've loaned a family member close to $20,000 which has not been repaid. The loans have not been formally documented, but I have the canceled checks as proof. Can I issue a document in 2014 to write this off as bad debt in order to reduce my taxable income ? I'd assume that I'd have to issue a document that would accordingly declare the same amount as income to the other party who has failed to repay the loan.",

        "If you have a real loan situation and you can prove it, you can take a bad debt deduction. Transactions between family members are given close scrutiny. You will need to be able to prove that the loan is a bona fide loan and not a gift.\n\nFacts will be considered, such as were written promissory notes used? Was an interest rate stated? Was there a definite time of payment? Did you keep books, or a journal showing the transaction as a loan? Was any prior loan to the same person paid back? Did you sue to collect?\n\nIt is possible to take bad debt treatment, provided that the transaction was really a loan, but since you will need proof of the nature of the transaction, and your question states that there were no written promissory notes, so you may have a tough time.",
        "Though you should check with a CPA, generally, individuals can't deduct \"bad debts\" , because they're cash-basis taxpayers.",
        "I would reclassify your question as a tax question.\n\nMy best understanding is that you cannot claim a deduction for a get between you as an individual and another person.\n\nAgain, seek tax advice. I am re categorizing your question. Best of luck."

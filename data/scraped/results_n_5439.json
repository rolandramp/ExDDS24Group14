    "title": "Can I place a lien on a my ex-husband's bank account to pay community debts owed?",
    "question": "There are three community debts that my ex- was ordered to pay in our divorce judgment. He hasn't paid these, and now the debtors are suing me to collect. It's been nearly 4 years that I've been carrying these debts on my own. Someone advised me that I could put a lien on his bank account to collect funds. I'm looking for further opinions.",

        "In general, you can not place any lien on any bank account without a court ordered judgment. Right now all you have is the judgment with an order requiring him to pay the debts. That order is useless to you, without more, in terms of getting money out of the other party’s bank account. You are going to have to motion the court for an order finding he failed to pay the debts as ordered by the court and an order granting you damages in whatever amount suffered as a result of his failure to pay as ordered. You could file an order to show cause regarding contempt of court for failure to pay as ordered, but that type of motion carries with it some additional burdens of proof which take more time and effort to litigate than filing a motion a discussed above. Once the court enters the order granting you damages for failure to pay, you would then obtain an abstract of judgment for the amount the court ordered as damages and use that abstract to lien on the bank account. I do not recommend that you pursue this on your own because of all the procedural and legal maneuvers that need to be instituted. Contact a local family law attorney who is experienced to guide you.

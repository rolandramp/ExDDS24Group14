    "title": "Can I stop a creditor from being paid out of property sale escrow, until a motion to vacate a default judgment is heard?",
    "question": "Is it possible to get a court order requiring that a judgment lien creditor put the proceeds from an ordered property sale in a trust account pending the results of a motion to set aside a default judgment? I am selling my property while in bankruptcy to settle mortgage debt, but there is also an invalid default judgment lien on the property that was procured by fraud on the court and I am certain it will be set aside. However, I am told the escrow cannot close unless the creditors get paid and sign a release of their debt, so the property can be sold. However, if this creditor is paid from the sale before the motion to set aside his default judgment is heard, this person will find a way to make the proceeds disappear and will get out of returning them, once the judgment is set aside.",

        "All collection by creditors against the debtor are stayed (stopped) by the bankruptcy filing. So, if the creditor is seeking to collect money from you, you should bring that to the attention of the BK Trustee, and simultaneously inform the Superior Court if an action is pending there. The Trustee, BK Judge, and Superior Court judge can then sort it out.\n\nGOOD LUCK!!",

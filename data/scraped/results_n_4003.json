    "question": "I am the bookkeeper for a LLC corporation. I am strictly an employee with no financial investment with the company. The owner would like to add me to the bank accounts as a authorized signer. What are the legal responsibilities for a signer on a LLC corporation account? I have read that if the corporation falls in to debt with the IRS, I could be held personally responsible. Is this correct?",

        "Attorneys Smith and Natoli offer excellent responses. Taking on the responsibility as a signer on the company's accounts does subject you to potential liability to the IRS for any failure to pay payroll taxes, and if the company fails to make the employee side contribution (the trust funds), they can seek criminal penalties in addition to money. While it is likely convenient for your employer to be able to add you as a signer on these accounts, you may wish to carefully consider that before doing so. You would likely not be liable for other claims or debts, but if there are any problems with the accounts and the handling of them, as an authorized signer, you are in the line of fire.\nGood luck.",
        "Attorney Smith is correct. Your liability in this regards is limited of course. You would not be on the hook for company debt in general as the members, but only as it MAY relate to taxes and even here only under the right conditions.\n\nPerhaps you can use this as leverage to ask for a raise? You may want to consult a lawyer or CPA in private and have them explain the issues to you in much more detail so you are entirely clear on your possible exposure.\n\nBest regards,\nFrank\nNatoli-Lapin, LLC",
        "Yes. For delinquent payroll taxes, the IRS looks to the signers on the bank account."

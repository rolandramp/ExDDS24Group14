    "title": "Can creditors have claim against a small estate that falls under CA Probate Code 13100?",
    "question": "Let's say this California Estate is under $100K and qualifies to be distributed following a 13100 declaration. The deceased has left no will. But, creditors have claims that are much larger than the Estate. Those claims may be beyond the 4 year statute of limitation because the deceased creditor remained in hiding until his death. I understand, that creditors have a new 1 year statute of limitation since death to make their claims against the Estate.",

        "If any statute of limitations has run, while the decedent was living, regardless of whether the debtor/decedent was in hiding or otherwise (a creditor can always sue and request that the court permit the publication of the summons in order to fall within the statute of limitations), I believe the creditor is out of luck. The one-year statute of limitations from the date of death of the debtor doesn't extend a debt for which the statute has already run. What the one-year statute does is actually reduce the time by which a creditor can bring an action. (Example 1: John obtains a new credit card and charges $1,000 on it on January 1, 2011. John dies on February 1, 2011, without paying the credit card. The credit card company has 1 year from Feb. 1, 2011 to bring an action to collect. The four-year statute has been reduced to 1 year because of John's death. Example 2: John's debt is six-years old. Creditor has sent dunning notices, but has never filed an action to collect. John dies. Creditor is entitled to notice of administration in order to file a claim. If the executor/administrator accepts the claim, Creditor gets paid. If claim is rejected, creditor may sue, but will probably lose because the original debt was incurred more than 4 years ago, and the estate can rely on the statute of limitations as a defense).",
        "The small estate affidavit procedure is just an authorized method to collect assets of a decedent where the overall estate does not justify a full probate. It has no effect on claims by creditors, and anyone receiving the property of the decedent will receive it subject to any valid debt.\n\nIn your case, however, it appears that the claims are barred by the statute of limitations. The one-year statute for claims against a decedent does not revive any claims that are already barred. To the contrary, it effectively shortens the limitations period so that any claims in existence at the death of the decedent must be brought within one year after death or are forever barred. A claim that was already barred by the statute at the time of death does not get revived.",
        "The 13100 affidavit does not protect against creditors' claims. As part of the declaration you agree to indemnify the person or company turning the property over to you from any claims that might arise.\n\nAs for a \"new\" 1 year statute of limitations, you're confusing apples & oranges. If the statute has already expired before the person dies, it does to somehow get resurrected ... the 1 year statute of limitations you are referring to is found in California Civil Code section 366.2. It SHORTENS the statute of limitations to 1 year even if it would have been longer had the decedent lived.",
        "With this many issues, the estate should definitely hire a lawyer. While I don't practice in California, I'm fairly confident in saying that legitimate creditors are entitled to be paid even if the estate qualifies for streamlined \"small estate\" probate process.\n\nWhether the debts are legitimate or not will be up to the executor and attorney to make a determination on, and refusals may be appealed to the court. You can't assume that the passage of time will invalidate claims...different statutes of limitations apply to different types of claims. Some have no statute of limitations, and the statute of limitation may be tolled (put on pause) due to the decedent's intentional actions to dodge his creditors.\n\nWith all of these things in play, I don't see a reasonable way to avoid hiring an experienced probate attorney to deal with the estate. Best of luck!"

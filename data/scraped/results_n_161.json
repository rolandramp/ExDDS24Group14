    "title": "Can private student loans (Sallie Mae) be claimed on a bankruptcy ?",
    "question": "I owed Sallie Mae $13k and it got sent to a collection agency and now they are saying it will be going into litigation, wondering if I can just file a bankruptcy since I also have other debt however Iâ€™m unclear if private student loans can be included.",

        "While I agree with my colleagues that most student loan debt is non-dischargeable, that is NOT always the case and I don't want you to get the impression that it is impossible to discharge student loans. The tides have been changing. You should seek a consultation with an attorney who is familiar with discharging student loans in bankruptcy and outside of bankruptcy to fully understand your options. Further, keep your eye on Congress and call your reps. There is an active effort to restore student loan dischargeability in bankruptcy. The House recently passed a Bill to do just that. It has stalled, but there is hope.",
        "My colleagues are correct in that student loans are a different animal than most other debt. It takes a detailed analysis by a qualified attorney who specializes in the cross over between student loans and bankruptcy. Student loan debt has to be specifically addressed in a bk. Perhaps the best thing to do is speak with a bankruptcy attorney in Riverside County, and then have that attorney speak with a California Student Loan Attorney to formulate a good working plan.",
        "When you say \"included\" you would have to declare that it is owed and it would be on your bankruptcy schedules, but your instinct is good that there is an exception to discharge for most educational loans borrowed within the \"cost of attendance\" for that school at that time, provided that the school was a qualified institution for higher education.\n\nAfter 2005, private loans are not normally discharged with a bankruptcy case if the loan program was guaranteed (even if only partially) by a governmental unit or a nonprofit institution.\n\nEven for Navient loans, (what Sallie Mae is now called) there is a slight chance that your loan or loans are not within the exception to discharge if the school was not one for higher education, or if the amount loaned was in excess of the \"cost of education.\"\n\nAlthough this can be a longshot, sometimes you can raise a stink and get a good settlement.",
        "The student loan is probably non-dischargeable. To be sure, contact DJ Rausa, an AVVO listed lawyer for a 2nd opinion.",
        "Sallie Mae is a part of a federal loan program and their loans can't be discharged except in extraordinary circumstances. Attorney DJ Rausa is an expert on the subject. He is licensed in California and Tennessee and can be found here on AVVO.",
        "Student loans are usually not dischargeable in bankruptcy unless a lawsuit is filed against them in the bankruptcy and you can satisfy the requirements to have them discharged. There are some exceptions with respect to private student loans though. You should be contacting a bankruptcy attorney who handles student loan cases in your area. Good luck."

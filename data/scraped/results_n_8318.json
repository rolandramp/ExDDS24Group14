    "title": "Can hurriedly, hand written and signed stipulated judgment be challenged?",
    "question": "In my case after reaching basic agreement on properties and cash distribution outside the court room, hurriedly hand written stipulated judgment was made and properties (liabilities with negative equities) were given to me and a lumpsum cash was given to spouse. Somehow her attorney added a clause keeping her on the title of one of the properties. I didn't realize it that time as it was all hand written in minutes and was signed by the judge and all other parties. I don't want this as she may create problems in future when I will try to sell it.",

        "If the stipulation is less than six months old, the quick answer is \"Yest it can be done\". You need to file a motion under Code of Civil Procedure 473(b) asking the court to \"set aside\" the decision because it was entered into due to \"excuseable neglect\". The judge will then evaluate the situation and if they feel you were taken advantage of by the quick talking attorney and pushed into something you didn't really understand then the order will be set aside. This does not end the case it just takes you back to where you were the moment before you signed the agreement. That means you need to develop a logical alternative arangement for dividing the assets and debts or you need to ask the court to set the matter for a hearing where the judge will deciside the issues. Either way you will need the help of an attorney in Riverside who can help you prepare the motion and develop an alternative plan.\nGood Luck",
        "Yes, it is possible to modify or even set aside a stipulated judgment, but the chances are quite small. An attorney would need to evaluate the complete set of facts and to make a motion with the court ASAP.",
        "Impossible to answer without a LOT more details, which you should review with an experienced family law attorney IMMEDIATELY. \"Set aside\" requests are subject to STRICT time limits, so you need to find out what your options are, and make a decision, ASAP.",
        "I am not evaluating your particular case. There is not enough facts. But a motion to set aside the agreement and judgment can be made, with a declaration stating the factual basis and points and authorities citing legal precedents and statute(s).\n\nIf you were not represented by an attorney and the other spouse was represented, this would go along way in seeking a set aside. Also, the time that has elapsed between the agreement and the set aside motion.\n\nI would carefully examine the property disclosures to determine if you had full disclosure prior to signing the agreement.\n\nIf you did not have an attorney, the Judge should have read the stipulation aloud and inquired if this is in fact your agreement. Also, the Judge should have given certain admonitions to you especially about you not having an attorney. If both sides have an attorney, this is rushed through or not even addressed..the judge just signs it and assumes your attorneys explained the agreement to you. But the better practice is to make a record, give admonitions, and ask questions of the parties on the record so the agreement is solid.\nYou should not try to set this aside without an attorney. Also, its not a slam dunk; you may not be able to set it aside."

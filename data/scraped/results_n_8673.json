    "title": "How am I able to get out of a $250,000 lawsuit?",
    "question": "I was in a 3 car collision. I hit one car and then that car hit another. At the in end of it all, I was I was at fault. Now this person is sueing me through Larry H Parker. After a few months the law suit was settled. The third party is coming after me as well and this time the law suit is for $250,000 with Larry H Parker. The same person that the first party sued me from. Is this even possible. This person had time to make their claims and I think the third party waited for the first person to get payed out. Then he made his claims. I feel like I am being ambushed in which this case is over exaggeratting their personal debts instead of the actual estimate of his car. He's sueing for $250,000 on pain and sufferings. Is this even possible??? PLEASE HELP!!!!!!!",

        "What attorney Koslyn stated is correct. There is nothing wrong with what is going on from the facts as you have stated.\n\nWhat is puzzling is that generally, insurance companies will not settle cases unless all claims are made--that is they wait until after the statute of limitation has passed to know exactly all the claims pending and then they begin negotiations and to distribute the limits of the policy between all the claimants. Your insurance company must be there to defend you and so your best source of information about what is going on and what sort of a defense you should be expecting is them.\n\nIf your insurance company is not defending you--then something is majorly wrong and you should have a face to face conversation with a local attorney to figure out what aren't you being defended.\n\nI hope this helps-\n\nNima Taradji\nhttp://personalinjuryattorneyz.com\n\nDisclaimer: I am a lawyer licensed in the State of Illinois only, and I am not your lawyer (unless you have been in my office and signed a contract).

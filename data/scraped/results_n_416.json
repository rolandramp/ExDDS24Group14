        "Remember, BK is more than checking boxes on forms you find online. Find/consult/hire a lawyer using the Avvo feature \"Find a Lawyer\".

Some of us offer a free consultation by phone or in person. Take us up on it.\n\nBecause the bankruptcy process can be handled entirely by phone, email and fax, there is no need to personally visit the lawyer’s office unless you want to. Don’t be limited by the location of the BK lawyers you select.",
        "Yes, a chapter 7 bankruptcy will both discharge the debt and require the DMV to restore your license.\n\nSo long as there was no DUI involved, the bankruptcy discharge should attach to the debt in the judgment.\n\nYou should use an experienced bankruptcy attorney to do it right.\n\nAlso, don't be against the idea of chapter 13; there could be benefits of which you are not yet aware, and if you find out later and try to convert to 13 it may not be possible.",

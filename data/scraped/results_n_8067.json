    "title": "I am a cosigner on a car loan. The car got repossessed and I wasn't informed. What can I do?",
    "question": "Around 2008 I cosigned for a car loan for a friend. I lost touch with them and come 2010 I was surprised to find out there was a lien on my bank account. The bank informed me that it was from Ford re: the loan. I contacted my friend again and he said that the car was repossessed and he filed for bankruptcy thereafter so they shouldn't be coming after me.",

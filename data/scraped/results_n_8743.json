    "question": "I have debt that has been closed by the original CC Company. But in the creditor’s notes on my cc report it states ‘purchased by another lender”. I am trying to research the Collection Company before making any payments but there is no web site for Riverwalk Holding. I was told that this company bought my debt for cents on the dollar, and that I can haggle their payment price. Is that true?",

        "I have seen debts sold by the creditor, only to later be claimed by MULTIPLE debt collectors, each of which claimed to have documents that proved it was the owner. Maybe this debt buyer/collector is the legitimate owner, and may be it is not. If you do settle with this company, be sure to get a document showing that the debt has been settled in full, so that you can use this to get your credit report updated to show a zero balance and also to defend yourself if another debt collector comes calling in the future.\n\nI represent consumers against debt collectors and debt collection lawsuits, and have never heard of this company, so I cannot affirm who they are or if they might sue you if you refuse to negotiate. Remember, if they are the actual owner of the debt, they can sue you and you will then need to defend. Of course, if there are any documents that they cannot produce to prove true ownership or if they wait too long to sue you and the statute of limitations expires, then they will lose and you wind up paying nothing.\n\nThe price that is paid by a debt buyer for a pool of debts depends on several factors, such as how recent the defaults were taken, the type of debt, the lender, the credit of the borrowers, and perhaps numerous other factors, such as if the borrowers are homeowners.",
        "The new company may very well negotiate with you.

    "question": "I am 60, long term unemployed, living off my IRA...just waiting to start collecting Social Security. My only major asset is my mobile home, which as a Homestead Declaration on it.

        "I do not think that communicating your financial circumstances to the debt collector will be of any benefit. They do not believe debts. They run their own asset searches. As far as going to court, if the collector decides to sue you, it will pay the court filing fee and other expenses. You will be served with Summons and Complaint. Before you can go to court, you will need to file an Answer (or other pleading) with the court and either pay the court filing fee or as for a fee waiver. I would advise filing an Answer and waiting for the court date. I have seen quite a few instances in which the collector decides to dismiss the case (\"without prejudice\") instead of sending an attorney and witnesses to court to spend a day.

        "I doubt telling a debt collector that you are judgment proof will stop him from filing a lawsuit. Many collection agencies threaten to file a lawsuit but never get around to actually doing it. If the case goes to court you should defend it but not be saying you are judgment proof. You might have a defense of statute of limitations if the debt is very old. Maybe the amount the debt collector is seeking to obtain is wrong.",
        "Having no \"real defense\" or believing yourself to be judgment proof should not prevent you from fighting the lawsuit. Debt collectors often file lawsuits without having the necessary documents to prove their case. Informing them that you are judgment proof is not going to stop them from obtaining a judgment and attempting to collect anyway. If you do nothing, they will eventually try to levy your bank account and you will have to file exemptions and go through a small hassle of your own."

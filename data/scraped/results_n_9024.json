        "You should consult with these debts with a family law attorney and bring as much documentation as possible. If he is trying to harass you or retaliate with this lawsuit, if you are represented he may be in for a shocker, when you get his case thrown out of court. If we are talking about small claims court, it would still be worthwhile for you do go through this process and consult with a lawyer to know how to answer the judge about each item. Keep good notes and be well organized, which will also make your case go better for you and may get the small claims judge to rule in your favor. If your lawyer advises you that you owe some money for some items, offer to pay only those items and be specific. Make payments if that's all you can do, but I don't think you should have him deduct it from his child support payments, as it becomes a nightmare to track these deductions. All payments should be by check.",
        "Apparently he wants to claim that these charges were a loan from him to you that you should repay, and you're argument is that these were mutual and child care expenses made with his prior consent, and he's trying to retaliate against you for getting full custody of your child.\n\nIf he sues you in Small Claims court, it'll be his word (and his credibility as a witness and whatever 3rd party witnesses, emails and texts from you, documents etc. he's got that support his version) against yours. Since he's obligated to support the child, and since he got you a credit card with your name on it on his account, I think it will be hard for him to claim that these charges were loans.\n\nHire a lawyer if you're not sure what to do if you get sued.\n\nDisclaimer: Please note that this answer does not constitute legal advice, and should not be relied on, since each state has different laws, each situation is fact specific, and it is impossible to evaluate a legal problem without a comprehensive consultation and review of all the facts and documents at issue. This answer does not create an attorney-client relationship."

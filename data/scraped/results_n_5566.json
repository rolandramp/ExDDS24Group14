    "answers": [
        "It depends.\n\nIf there are any life threatening (to you or the baby) issues, ERs are required to provide service regardless of ability to pay.\n\nA hospital is NOT required to provide regular medical services that are \"elective\" unless they are comfortable with the client's ability to pay. As the prior attorney mentioned, hospitals may have different requirements.\n\nGood luck.",
        "They may be more diligent in inquiring into your insurance and yes, they may demand payment on prior amounts. They likely will demand some sort of payment agreement. Can't know, every hospital is different. I have a client who discharged medical bills in bankruptcy and they demanded proof of insurance and deductible up front. They were not legally allowed to ask for the past amount due b/c client was bankrupt, but she agreed to pay b/c she wanted to keep her doctor. She was aware of all of this prior to filing the bankruptcy. Another client (who also discharged much less debt with hospital) had no issues going back to same hospital. Really depends on the hospital and what insurance you have."

        "Unless you voluntarily paid the judgment, you should expect interest to accrue as provided in the terms of this court order. The nonappearance of the creditor's attorney at your debtor exam is not a relevant factor in the imposition of ongoing interest. After all, would you have preferred that the creditor seize your bank account and started garnishing your pay back in 2011? Hope this perspective helps!",
        "You must show the letter to an attorney to ensure that the debt amount claimed is valid. Judgments do in fact accrue interest. The Judgment itself would state at what rate the interest accrues, most likely. With respect to the debtor examination, are you referring to an examination in the state court action, or was this a bankruptcy creditors meeting? It is improper for an attorney to summon you to a meeting and then not appear, however, what if anything you can do about it would depend, and most likely it wouldn't be worth filing a motion for sanctions, depending on what your attorney would charge you for the motion prep and hearing time.",
        "One thing has nothing to do with the other. The failure of a judgment debtor's exam to take place and the amount of debt have nothing to do with each other.\n\nTypically, judgments do accrue interest. The answer to you question lies in the judgment. Read the judgment, it will tell you if post judgment interest and costs were awarded (which they probably were)."

    "question": "I just did a public records search on myself and found a judgment supposedly entered against me 3 years ago! I am going to file a motion to vacate the judgment. My question: can the Plaintiff garnish my paycheck or bank accounts while my motion to vacate judgment is pending in the courts?",

        "Several steps have to occur if you are trying to stop garnishment. You could benefit from meeting with an attorney to discuss further. Even if you decide not to hire the attorney the consultation with him or her could help you to understand the issues and your options. Many attorneys offer a free consultation. I wish you the best.",
        "No. simply filing motion to vacate judgment will not stop garnishment or seizure of assets.\nYes. Prevailing party can garnish wages and take other actions to enforce the judgment while motion to vacate judgment is pending.\nYou may file petition to stay enforcement. If successful, the garnishment will be temporarily stopped.",
        "Not unless you obtain an order staying execution of the judgment. That may require an ex parte application and, possibly, the posting of a bond. However, if you have good grounds for setting aside the judgment, you may be OK. But retain an attorney who can file your motion ASAP. After filing the motion, your attorney can contact the other side's attorney and probably stay enforcement proceedings pending the hearing on the motion.",
        "No, merely filing the motion to set aside the default and vacate default judgment does not stay the enforcement of the judgment. The judgment creditor can levy bank accounts, garnish wages, lien personal property and take debtor examinations while the motion is pending.",
        "Accord with counsel. That said, if the judgment is you--not someone with a similar name--there would have been collection action taken before now. Garnishment seems unlikely.",
        "In a word - Yes. Your motion is no more than a request that the court vacate the existing judgment. Pending a determination by the court on that motion, the status quo continues. If such action by the creditor has been threatened or is being carried out, you may consider filing a request to enjoin all enforcement efforts while the motion is pending.\n\nHowever, given the fact that the judgment was entered 3 years ago, you are going to have a rather skeptical judge to convince that the judgment should be vacated. To have a chance of doing so and to understand your options, you really should immediately consult with and hire a local litigation attorney who can review your case and suggest a course of action/options. Don't go this one alone."

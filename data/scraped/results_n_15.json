    "title": "I want to oppose a \"Motion to Withdraw\" from my bankruptcy matter. Is this a form or do I do a declaration of opposition?",
    "question": "My attorney did not acr in my best interest for keeping my property. Filed a Chapter 7 instead of an 11. I cannot have the chapter 7 changed to 11 without an attorney. Now he is trying to get out of the situation after charging me $3,500. I am doing opposition to his motion to withdraw as counsel. Question is there a form or do I do a pleading?",
    "answers": [
        "If you feel that your attorney was not acting in your best interest, you should retain new counsel -- not force him/her to continue to represent you. Most courts will not force a lawyer to continue to represent you if s/he claims there has been an irreparable breakdown. I would also note that I do not know any lawyer that would agree to represent you in chapter 11 for $3,500, so you should probably check the terms of your engagement letter. In any event, ask the court to allow you time to seek new counsel and to adjourn any matters on the calendar for a reasonable period of time. Once you obtain new counsel you can discuss the viability of converting your case to chapter 11.",
        "You will have some difficulty in preventing your attorney from withdrawing from your case. A court of law will force an unwilling attorney to represent a client in very limited circumstances.\n\nMoreover, my colleagues make the valid point that you may be better served with a willing and competent Chapter 11 attorney. Please be sure to consult with a Chapter 11 attorney in your area.",
        "I agree with Attorney Heston 100%. In fact, your attorney may not even be able to represent you anyway in a ch 11. Why? Because ch 11 is far different and must be an area of practice the attorney knows. You do NOT want to pay an attorney to \"practice\" on your case either. Very few standard ch 7 bankruptcy attorneys in fact practice ch 11..my guess is 4% maybe or so.\n\nFurthermore, no attorney knows the facts upon which you state a ch 11 is right. In fact, a ch 5 is a newer chapter that you probably qualify for too. Again, we do not know all the facts. Why not do a ch 13 possibly to payoff the liquidation amount? Again, only an attorney knowing all the facts can advise you. Find a new attorney here on AVVO and pay them for an hour to review your case and provide you your options so that then you can know which option you would like and the costs thereof too. Good luck.",
        "Consider this situation in a different context.\n\nYou've gone to an orthopedic surgeon for pain in your knee. You think a knee replacement is in order, but the orthopedist instead performs an arthroscopic procedure to repair a tear in the meniscus. You suffer undue pain and are fighting off an infection, and the surgeon says he/she is done with the task for which engaged.\n\nYou still want to go forward with a knee replacement, which is vastly more costly and you don't have the money to pay for it. Yet for some reason you want to the surgeon who did a poor job of arthroscopically repairing the meniscus tear to now take on the vastly more complex matter of replacing your knee. The surgeon does not want to do so, and insists on advance payment.\n\nWhy would you ever want to do this? A simple Chapter 7 is to a complex Chapter 11 what a simple arthroscopic repair of the meniscus is to a full-blown knee replacement procedure.\n\nGo find someone who doesn't already have a track record of giving you advice you consider for, and start fresh. Be prepared to spend not $3500, but on the order of 10 times that amount for a qualified Chapter 11 practitioner."

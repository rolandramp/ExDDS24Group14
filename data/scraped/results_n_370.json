    "question": "I was in an accident with only liability insurance that was my fault. I had a title loan with a company in ca. I filed for bankruptcy and they came and got the car. Prior to that I filed with the dmv for non operational. How do I get it out of my name since the lienholder now has the car and the pink. Am I now not responsible for the car? Are they now the legal owners?",

        "I agree with my colleagues. Your bankruptcy has eliminated your future liability for the car and the title loan. Since they have possession of the vehicle and the pink slip they are the legal owner of the vehicle and may proceed to sell the vehicle at auction, etc. You can file a Release of Liability with the DMV but it is not absolutely necessary.",
        "The bankruptcy eliminated any future liability, so it won't hurt to sign it over to the lienholder if they are requesting a signautre. Also, file a Release of Liability with the DMV.",

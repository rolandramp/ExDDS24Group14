    "question": "Petitioner works oversea, and has assets oversea, however, hasn't provided any financial disclosure even after the court issued an order for it. Will the court just use the financial disclosure information provided by responder (responder only knows the assets in US and disclosed it) for 50-50 allocation if the petitioner never provides the disclosure and not settlement can be reached? Can you please explain code 2107 in plain English?",
    "answers": [
        "You will need an attorney. Why? Because there are a lot of legal issues involved. The section you reference sets forth how you can force disclosure documents from the other side. In Calif., we have full disclosure requirements:12 months bank statements, two years tax returns, pays tubs an Income Expense Declaration, a Schedule of Assets and Debts with all supporting documents and a Preliminary and Final Disclosure to be filed with the court. The court can order these, and order \"issue sanctions\" preventing later evidence on certain issues for that failure. Fees and other penalties can also be issued. In addition, you raised the need for a \"bifurcation\" or separation of the termination of marital status issue. that is possible and can be done by motion to the court. Please see an attorney on these issues.",
        "Family code section 2107 allows a party who has not received a declaration disclosing all assets and debts from the opposing party, to file a motion to order that they comply. If the offending party does not comply with the order, then the court can penalize the offending party any way them deem just. If there are other assets, the court can reserve judgment on those assets and still grant you a divorce and made a judgment on the assets that have been disclosed. If offending party does not provide disclosures, file a motion for sanctions and to request that you be allowed to proceed via default on your matter.",
        "You can compel disclosures and if they don't provide them then they can be sanctioned including terminating sanctions meaning they lose an issue. They can agree without disclosures if the parties waive them."

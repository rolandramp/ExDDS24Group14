    "title": "Should I go ahead and sign a SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT AND MUTUAL RELEASE form from a collection agencies lawyer?",
    "question": "An ER bill from Jan of 2009, wrongfully went to collections. A collection company, started posted it to my credit reports as of summer 2014 (well past the statue of limitations - 4 years in CA). I noticed it and contacted them and demanded it removed at once or I would take it to court. I also contacted the hospital who agreed that yes a mistake was made. Collection company tried to get me to pay regardless, to which I refused. Their lawyer (I checked and the lawyer is a real estate attorney), wrote to me asking me to pay. I told him that I would sue if not removed. A few days ago, I received an email containing a PDF Settlement Agreement And Mutual Release form. The email stated that after signing the form, that his client, the collection agency, would remove the collection account.",

        "You should consider discussing your matter with an attorney who is familiar with the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and the Rosenthal Act (California's version of the FDCPA). These laws regulate the manner in which debt collectors are supposed to do their job. Specifically, there are rules that apply to debts that are beyond the statute of limitations. There are also rules for credit reporting disputed debts. A consumer lawyer might be able to help you determine whether the creditor and/or collector violated the law.\n\nAs for whether you should sign the agreement, I can't provide an answer because I have not reviewed it.",
        "Unless you understand everything, and every part of the agreement is in writing, and you know exactly what you are giving up, you should have an attorney review the document and your situation. The attorney should be an attorney who regularly represents consumers in collection litigation. I cannot give you any advise on a \"settlement agreement\" that I have not read.",
        "We cant read the form, and really dont want to but it sounds like you won and when you sign the release its over. I assume it says you will not sue them. Only you know that."

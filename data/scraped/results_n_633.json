    "title": "How should I go about dealing with creditors?",
    "question": "Feb. 2014, emergency surgery, stopped breathing 20min. resuscitated thought to be a vegetable. 3 weeks later I leave hospital. Medical bills even with insurance. Another surgery in Nov. same year. Following year 2015 yet another surgery. I was a pretty sharp person that made $100,000 a year, then this all happened. Now, I have creditors filing leins against my home. My debt is $15,444. The road back to here has taken all this time for me to get, well, better. I do not work do to frustration and headache issues. My MD would not help with disability claim. My house is owned by my Trust. I do not trust the debt relief co. So what would be a solution to stop this madness.",

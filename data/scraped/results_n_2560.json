    "title": "I just received in the mail a request for entry of default. What does this mean??",
    "question": "Back in June 2014, I received a summons from a creditor (Portfolio Recovery Associates). Instead of answering the summons, the creditor and I came up with a payment plan to pay off the debt and told me as long as I was making my payments, the lawsuit will not go through as we now settled this. I have been faithful in paying the payments and thought everything was ok and still doing so. All of a sudden, I get this. What does it mean? I don't understand this at all. Reason why I didn't answer the summons and instead settled with the creditor was because I could not afford a lawyer, not even just to help me fill out the answer form. I've barley been making ends meet since this arrangement was made and have a second one with them as well and I just don't understand what this request means.",

        "Mr Chen is correct. Since you did not answer the summons and complaint, the Creditors Attorney can request the entry of a default. The entry of a default will prevent you from participating in the law suit and raising any defenses you may have. Perhaps you can seek help from a local legal aid office. Under the circumstances they may be able to reverse any default in that you were responding directly to the creditors attorney.",
        "A request for entry of default is a document which a plaintiff submits to the court to inform the court that a defendant who was properly served with the summons and complaint failed to timely respond to the summons and complaint.

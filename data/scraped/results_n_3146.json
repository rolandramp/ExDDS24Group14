        "What you need right now is not to file a bankruptcy necessarily but some pre-bankruptcy planning. Maybe now is the time to pull the trigger on a chapter 7 and later when you get back on your feet, prior to sheriff sale, you can file a 13. Sit down with a bankruptcy attorney in your state and map out a strategy. Maybe when you were both working, you didn't qualify for a 7 because you were over the median income level in your state. Now because of reduced income, you qualify and can protect all your assets. Later when your income increases, you can file a 13 to cure the mortgage and not worry about means test problems because you will have eliminated your unsecured debt. Timing is everything. Call a bankruptcy attorney, map out a game plan & implement it! Good luck!",
        "So if unemployed, how do you expect to fund the very expensive Chapter 13 process? Most of the success of any Chapter 13 is the PLANNING that goes into implementing it. Do you understand that a Chapter 13 will require you to resume paying your mortgage and will require you to make a payment IN ADDITION to making the mortgage payment. Unless you can document that you have the money to pull this off, a Chapter 13 will be dismissed within a couple of months, meaning you wasted good money on credit counseling & court filing fees. Time to rethink this strategy. Hope this perspective helps!",
        "What is your source of income? Being able to afford an attorney is actually a litmus test for whether chapter 13 will be feasible and accomplish what you need to accomplish. If you cannot afford an attorney for chapter 13 bankruptcy, then you have practically zero chance of being able to successful do a chapter 13.\n\nI sympathize with your situation. If you are only 2 months behind on house payments, you still have time. Here are some questions to answer:\n\n1. If you got rid of all your other debt (credit cards, medical bills), etc., will you be able to afford your mortgage payment without struggling (this question assumes you are still paying those debts).\n2. If you filed chapter 13, can you start making your mortgage payment, in full, on time by the next due date. (e.g. if you filed chapter on Sept. 5, can you pay your mortgage starting Oct. 1, and not fall behind again).\n\nSadly, the problem may be on the income side of your finances, not on the expense side. Bankruptcy only fixes the expense side (to some degree). It sounds like you probably need more income.\n\nIn any event, bankruptcy attorneys usually offer free consultations. Before you do anything, at least meet with a few to assess whether chapter 13 is the right option and will help.",
        "It is possible to file your own case, but you are unlikely to succeed. Chapter 13 has lots of pitfalls for the unwary that can cause your case to be dismissed. Once you are dismissed it will be much harder to file again and protect your house. Plus, if you aren't working and can't make the payments, you're not eligible for Chapter 13 relief right now.\nCommunicate with your mortgage company, stall them as long as possible to keep your house out of foreclosure; they're more likely to be patient if you're talking to them. Once you go to work or have other income you can file, and cure the mortgage arrears and keep your house. Be patient and don't act prematurely.",
        "As Mr. Waddell stated, since most bankruptcy attorneys offer free consultations, you absolutely should meet with one. The attorney should be able to analyze your current financial situation in 30-40 minutes and let you know whether chapter 13 will benefit you. The fact that neither of you is currently working makes a chapter 13 filing seem difficult at this time, especially if you're unable to afford your mortgage payment.\n\nFrom your facts alone, it's impossible to tell whether you're qualified for the chapter 13 filing.\n\nAs for costs, you'll need to pay the filing fee ($310), run credit report (~$50), and take two online courses related to credit and debt ($50). Attorney fees can vary depending on your case and whether any of the fee can be included in your monthly payment to the court.",
        "To further the good answers you've already received, I'll add that a Chapter 13 bankruptcy allows you to pay off the mortgage arrears, the payments you are behind, monthly over up to five years, but you also have to pay the current ongoing mortgage payments. If you can't afford to do that, the court won't approve (confirm) your payment plan and your case will be dismissed. It sounds like, since neither of your are working, a Chapter 13 wouldn't work for you at this time.",
        "I agree with Attorney Rode, and would just mention that many bankruptcy attorneys will do free initial consultations, so you have nothing to lose in talking to a few attorneys to discuss your options.",
        "I would highly recommend it. In order to file a Chapter 13 you need to be able to afford the mortgage payment after filing Chapter 13 plus a small \"plan payment\" which will pay the 2 months you are behind on the mortgage. If you both are not working then you may need to wait until one or both of you obtain employment so you can make the regular mortgage payment once you are in Chapter 13. As far as attorney fees, some attorneys may put all of their fee in the plan so you may not have to worry about an upfront cost. Call a few experienced Chapter 13 attorneys and discuss your situation."

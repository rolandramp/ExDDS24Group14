    "title": "Chapter 7 Bankruptcy discharge money owed to insurance company for workers comp insurance. I owned an LLC that is closing now.",
    "question": "So even though I was barely active last year, through a long set of circumstances, my workers comp company is saying I owe them because I didn't have an Owner Exemption, even though I had no employees. They say they have to charge me the California minimum premium by law or something like that. My LLC company is closing. I am looking at the best way to do this and also protect myself personally. Was thinking of a personal chapter 7 after the company is closed. Will that take care of this debt?",

    "title": "Status Conference in State Court and Bankruptcy Automatic Stay",
    "question": "My attorney on my state case withdrew because I'm in bankruptcy. There is a status conference coming up and the other side is lathering to set a trial date once the automatic stay expires, plus I don't trust this attorney to tell the truth. I have not found a new attorney yet. What can I file to let the court know the automatic stay is still in effect. Do I have to appear at the status conference? If I do appear, does that waive the automatic stay?",
    "answers": [
        "You will want to file Form CM-180, which is the Notice of Stay of Proceedings. It is also a good idea to attach a conformed copy of the face page of the bankruptcy petition so that the Court may identify the filing date and case number.\n\nUpon your filing of the bankruptcy petition for relief from your debts a stay automatically goes into effect and it certainly does a lot to protect you from most collection activities by your creditors. It even excuses you from taking further part in an ongoing civil lawsuit and the need to appear at a Status Conference until the stay is terminated. But, given your present concerns about opposing counsel, it may be advisable to appear and confirm that the Court has been made aware of the bankruptcy filing. This is in addition to filing the Notice of Stay of Proceedings.\n\nNo. Your appearance at the Status Conference does not waive the automatic stay.",
        "Generally, as long as the automatic stay apply, you do not have to participate in a state court litigation and thus you do not have to participate in the hearing. You want to notify the Court by filing form CM-180 (notice of stay of proceedings) and attach to the form a proof of your bankruptcy filing. If the debt which is the subject of the state court litigation had been discharged in your bankruptcy, than you will not need to participate in the state court litigation as the effect of the discharge order is an injunction against the continuation of the state court proceeding. From the facts stated in your question it is impossible to know what type of bankruptcy you filed, if the state court litigation is covered by the discharge and if you are entitle for discharge in your bankruptcy. I suggest that you discuss these issue with your bankruptcy attorney. If you do not have one, than I suggest that you consult with a local bankruptcy attorney in your area. .Most bankruptcy attorneys provide some type of a limited initial free consultation.",
        "There is a form provided by the State Court Called \"Notice of Stay\" and an addition a Notice of Automatic provided by the Bankruptcy Court both on each web site, free of charge and can be filled out then printed. You attached the Notice of Meeting of Creditor's and the Bankruptcy form to the State form and file it with the State Court Clerk. Bring an extra copy to conform (stamped by the clerk). There should be no filing fee and then you will not have to appear for the Status Conference nor any other hearing in the State court as your discharge notice will protect you (If you get a discharge). If the other side continues the state court case you have a good cause to seek sanctions, costs and damages against the \"other side\". If you need to seek the damages some attorney's will take the matter on a contingency basis so you don't need to front any fees. Good luck If you can't find one we practice in this area of law.",
        "I agree with everyone including Mr. Stempler.\n\nThe fact that the opposing counsel is attempting to rush you to trial while you are still in bankruptcy and has not him/her self filed a Suggestion of Bankruptcy in lieu of the judicial council form tells me that this could be a short hearing when YOU file the proper form.\n\nIf the case has been veering about the docket for more than 1 year, the state court will, in my experience, order it dismissed without prejudice.\n\nThen you order the transcript and a certified copy of any CMC form or statement demanding a trial date at earliest while the stay is in effect and file a motion to show cause with the bankruptcy court since pushing a bankrupt to trial while the stay is in effect constitutes an attempt to collect the debt without stay relief, in violation of 11 USC 362.\n\nYour lawyer should not have chickened out on you so quick. Hire a new lawyer. This one's a bell ringer if you ring it right.",
        "If the opposing attorney lies to the court about the status of the automatic stay, then he or she will be held in contempt of the Bankruptcy Court. Will the claims in the state case be discharged, once the bankruptcy discharge is entered?

        "You, or your attorney should appear at the status conference. You should consult and retain new counsel. Appearing does not waive the stay. The stay is in affect until it is removed or dissolved by discharge of your bancrutpy.\n\nIf the state court already has notice of the automatic stay you do not need to serve them anything.\n\nI do not know who your opposing counsel is but it is unlikely that he/she will appear and lie to the court re the status of the stay.\n\nIn either case, the best thing you can do is retain new counsel to represent your interests.",

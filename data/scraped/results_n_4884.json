    "title": "What is the affidavit CCP 685.090 I need to file?",
    "question": "I won a case in San Mateo small claims court. I am filing a writ of execution. On the form #16, I can't locate a form for CCP 685.090 to file. Can somebody give me a declaration letter sample for adding interest, so I can use it for writing mine?",
    "answers": [
        "The form you need is a Memorandum of Costs after Judgment (MC-012): http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/mc012.pdf.\n\nFill in the first page (memo) and sign and date the bottom. On the second page (proof of service), fill in the information for the person who will mail a copy of the memo to the opposing party/ies; this \"server\" can be anyone described in paragraph 1. Make a copy of the 2-page memo (with the first page memo signed and dated by you, and the second page proof of service unsigned and undated), and give the copy along with a stamped, pre-addressed envelope to the server. After the server mails the copy, have him/her sign and date the proof of service.\n\nMake two copies of the fully executed memo. Mail or deliver the original 2-page document plus one copy of the 2-page document to the clerk of court along with the writ of execution and the $25.00 issuance fee. Include a self-addressed, stamped envelope so the clerk can mail the issued writ and \"conformed\" (court file-stamped) copy of the memo back to you.\n\nKeep in mind that a court-issued writ of execution is only valid for 180 days (approx. 6 months) from date of issuance. You might want to consider waiting until you know what you're going to have levied/garnished before you have the court issue the writ.\n\nThe California Courts website http://www.courts.ca.gov/selfhelp-smallclaims.htm offers a good self-help guide for judgment collection. (The California Courts website also provides all the downloadable fill-in-the-blank Judicial Council forms.) The Sacramento Law Library website http://www.saclaw.lib.ca.us/pages/enforce-judgment.aspx is another good source. Collections attorneys also use The Rutter Group \"Enforcing Judgments and Debts\" practice guide.\n\nGood luck."

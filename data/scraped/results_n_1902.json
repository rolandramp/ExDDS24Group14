    "title": "My husband and I are separated and he and his girlfriend bought a home . I signed off on the title. Do I have any rights",
    "question": "to the home? We've been separated for 10 years. He owes me 100k from his 401k , which I haven't received. He borrowed the money from his 401k for the down payment on the home he just purchased. I signed off on the title because he says he'll finalize the divorce and settle the 401k if I did. But he hasn't. Can I go after the house? Its in his name and his girlfriends name, but I signed off on the title. Is there anything I can do to get him to finalize the divorce?",
    "answers": [
        "In all likelihood you cannot go after the house. It is unclear from your question whether you and your husband have a court order regarding your rights to the 401(k) in his name. A family law attorney can help you sort through these issues as they are too complex to go it alone.",
        "On what basis do you claim that he owes you 100K from his 401K? Was there a judgment? As to finalizing the divorce, why haven't you done this? Why \"wait\" for him? As to the house, if there was a judgment entered regarding a legal separation that actually did divide the estates assets and debts, then no you probably can't go after the house. You need legal assistance from a family law attorney.",
        "No, you cannot go after the house. You need to hire counsel to get the divorce done.",
        "You need to talk with a local family law attorney. This is not something you will be able to do on your own."

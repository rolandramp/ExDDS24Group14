        "Although the credit companies do most often use crediting reporting for all accounts, you can't assume that debts that don't appear on your credit report won't be pursued, since merchants aren't obligated to report the credit itself or any delinquencies or outstanding debts. Credit reports exist for the benefit of those that extend credit, and their choice to use them or not doesn't have anything to do with your credit contracts.\n\nIf you have checked your credit through Experian, TransUnion and Equifax, it's possible that certain accounts have not been reported, but you disregard any collection attempts at your own peril.\n\nYou're best off referring to your original and amended agreements with those credit card companies to see where when they can sue you, and then acting accordingly. The statutes of limitation begin at the date of breach, when you stopped paying, so make sure you determine and calculate the statutes correctly for each account.\n\nDisclaimer: Please note that this answer does not constitute legal advice, and should not be relied on, since each state has different laws, each situation is fact specific, and it is impossible to evaluate a legal problem without a comprehensive consultation and review of all the facts and documents at issue. This answer does not create an attorney-client relationship."

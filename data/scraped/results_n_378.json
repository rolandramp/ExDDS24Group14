    "question": "Only thing I owe is child support arrears original case is 35 years old",

        "While I agree with my colleagues that domestic support obligations are nondischargeable, and only a plan of reorganization would make sense so that you could pay the arrearage over time, is the obligation currently in enforcement status?\n\nThe obligation to pay child support normally terminates in the child's 18th year. If this obligation is 35 years old, it stands to reason that it might actually be a 53-year-old debt. While there is no lapsing of family law judgments and orders, unlike civil judgments which lapse after 10 years unless renewed before lapsing, if the obligation is not being enforced at this time, filing a Chapter 13 case in order to pay the arrearage over 60 months may be problematic.\n\nThe judgment interest rate in California is 10% per annum, meaning that 350% interest has accumulated on the support arrears. In other words, $10,000 of unpaid child support may require a plan that pays $35,000 over 60 months. Since the claim would be deemed a priority claim, the full amount of the claim, plus accumulated interest, would have to be paid.\n\nThat might be untenable, but at the very least burdensome. If the claim is not being enforced against you at this time, you may want to \"let sleeping dogs lie.\"",
        "My colleagues are correct, child support is not dischargeable in bankruptcy, no matter how old the arrears are. I recommend a chapter 13 to pay the balance over 5 years or establishing a payment plan with the Department of Child Support Services.",
        "No. Child support is not dischargeable in any chapter in bankruptcy. You could file a ch13 and pay the support over up to 5 years but you can't discharge the obligation.",
        "Child support is considered a \"domestic support obligation\" and is generally a non-dischargeable debt per 11 USC 523a(5).

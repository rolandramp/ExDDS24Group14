        "DMI is one of many factors. You payment is driven by DMI (which as others said is a legal fiction), actual disposable income (based on the schedules), the liquidation test (value of unprotected property), what the law requires you to pay (certain taxes, child support, spousal support) and what you have to pay based on what you want to accomplish (mortgage arrears, car payments).\n\n[This communication is intended as general information and not specific legal advice, and this communication does not create an attorney-client relationship.]",

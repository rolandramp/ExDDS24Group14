        "Your IRA is safe. If you are concerned about money in your checking account, do not wait around and see if they seize it. Withdraw the money in your checking account. Regarding your 401k, you can likely access those funds if by taking a loan against the funds. If you borrow funds against your 401k there should not be a tax consequence. Based on the facts you have stated, a Chapter 7 may be a viable solution, but there are other factors to consider, to make sure you do not put any other property at risk.

        "Agreed taking an IRA withdraw early is a tax issue. In bankruptcy it is almost certainly fully exempt from the trustee or creditors.

If you convert money from the IRA to regular money not only will you pay tax on it if you ineligible for the withdraw and pay the penalty but you are changing the character of funds and creditors may be able to go after it.",

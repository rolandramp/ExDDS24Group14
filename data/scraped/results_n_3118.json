        "While I agree with all of my colleagues' answers, the most important one from an attorney seems to be missed. The primary reason most people form an entity for their business is to protect personal assets from business liabilities. These liabilities could be business-related debts - you simply spend more than you make - or legally assessed obligations - you harmed another person in the activities of your business. Co-mingling your personal and business accounting is the quickest way to enabling your creditors to \"pierce the corporate veil\" and gain access to your personal assets - present and future - to satisfy business obligations.",
        "Do NOT commingle personal and business expenses in the business account, even if it is a single-member LLC (\"SMLLC\"). There are multiple reasons why commingling could cause problems in the future and all of them come from experiences learned the hard way by clients. Here's a few to think about and hopefully convince you that your personal spending should be done exclusively out of your personal account and also that your Quickbooks need to be kept clean, accurate, and correct at all times.\n\nFirst, if your new business loses money for a few years, resulting in a loss on your Schedule C (the part of the tax return on which the \"Profit or Loss from Business\" will be calculated and reported), you could run afoul of the the \"Hobby Loss Limitations.\" When the IRS gets a series of tax returns that report consistent losses, the computer is trained to disallow those losses and determine that the business is really a hobby. If, during an audit or a dispute about the business' legitimacy, the Service sees that you are treating the \"business\" account as your personal piggy bank, you've just made it harder on yourself.\n\nSecond, during a general audit of your tax return the IRS wants to determine if the business expenses claimed on Schedule C are legitimate, the presence of personal expenses on the business bank account statements weaken the assumption that spending in the business account is for legitimate business expenses. Conversely, if there are business expenses that cannot be paid from the available balance in the business account, move money over from your personal account to the business account and then pay them. Don't commingle business and personal spending in your personal account either. If the company needs more money and you're going to pick up the bill, move enough money over from your personal account to the business account.\n\nThird, if you ever lose your records and you need to recreate what happened. If you can safely assume that all of the spending in the business account is business, then you'll have a much easier hill to climb in the event of data or records loss.\n\nFourth, you are going to need to make estimated tax payments calculated off the net income of the business. If you get in the habit of transferring most of the net income (gross receipts minus deductible business expenses) over to your personal account each month or so, you're going to have an easier time estimating how much you should pay in taxes. Of course, if you use Quickbooks, you can run a quarterly profit and loss statement and calculate your estimated taxes using that.\n\nLast, if you ever wind up trying to sell the business, the buyer will most likely wish to do some due diligence, which should always include an examination of the company's financial records.

        "This is not a simply question; there is a lot to consider. First, I don't know if DCSS is involved. If they are, you would need their consent. Also, if you don't seek a modification of the order, it will continue and regardless of what Mom agrees to until change. She can ask for enforcement with 10% legal interest and there is no retroactive modification.\n\nYou can argue that the Court should impute income to Mom because she will stopped not working because of her spouses new income, and that does not give her the right to place the entire financial burden on you. You never know what the Court will do, but it has been done. You need to have case law and statutory understand to make this argument.\n\nAnother argument is the cost of living in TN is substantially cheaper than CA, and therefore the Court should not use California Guideline for modifying support. There is a lot to consider, and you should know all your options before doing anything. These are arguments that have been used before and the Court will take them seriously if presented properly. However anything can happen.",

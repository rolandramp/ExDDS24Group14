    "question": "A creditor recorded an abstract of judgment. I own no real property now and I got a discharge in bankruptcy and now I want to buy a house and the escrow officer wants a bankruptcy order to remove the lien. How do I get it negated other than by a bankruptcy order to remove the lien? Can I record the discharge? The abstract of judgment had nothing to attach to.",

        "We need to know when the AOJ was recorded with respect to the filing of your bankruptcy petition.\n\nWas the AOJ recorded more than 90 days before you filed your bankruptcy petition? Within 90 days before you filed your bankruptcy petition? Or after you filed your bankruptcy petition?",
        "More often than not, if you simply notify the creditor or counsel for the creditor that the abstract was recorded in violation of the automatic stay or the discharge order in your case, they will file a release of lien in the county in which they mistakenly recorded.\n\nAs Mr. Salanick detailed, they are other tools potentially availabe to you in order to avoid the lien and possibly seek sanctions. However, I believe most creditors don't want to expose themselves to potential sanctions by the bk court and if they are properly notified of their mistake they will correct it. It would be a good idea to consult with the attorney who helped you file your case and if you filed in pro per, find a local bk attorney to properly assess all the details of your situation.",
        "If the creditor that recorded the lien ( after your discharge?) was listed in your bankruptcy case then there may be a violation of the discharge injunction. The discharge stops all creditors in existence (per-petition) from pursuing debt collection from you once the discharge order is issued, with limited exceptions only.\n\nTalk to a local bankruptcy lawyer to help you review and analyze the facts, and posdibly negotiate with the creditor. If the creditor fails to pay attention, you may want to reopen the bankruptcy and either (a) move for relief against the creditor and seek sanctions, including attorney fees, or (b) file a motion to avoid judgment lien to wipe out the recorded judgment, again, depending on the specific facts and dates/timing involved in all of this.\n\nFor more information visit: www.salanicklaw.com\n\nBest of luck!"

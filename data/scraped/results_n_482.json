    "title": "How do I go about having a written response in proper legal form for a law suit made against me?",
    "question": "I was served papers that I am being sued by Hunt & Henriques for a credit card I was not able to pay any more, the papers say I have 30days to send a written response to the court I now only have 7 days left and it must be in proper legal form. I have no idea how to do this? Do I need a lawyer to write something out for me or can I feel a paper out myself? I have no money to pay for legal advice at this hard time, please any advice would help me. Thank You.",

        "Ms. Rode is correct. Make sure the debt is not more than 4 years old. Note you have to pay a fee to file this. May be better to call and negotiate the debt instead of wasting the filing fee only to get a judgment against you.",
        "You can file a general denial which general denies the complaint: https://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/pld050.pdf\n\nUnless you have specific defenses, then you will want to file an answer articulating the specific defenses. There are some self-tutorials online and you may want to visit your local courthouse and see if they have a help desk or volunteers that can help you out.\n\nWhen you file your answer make sure you attach a proof of service that states that you mailed the answer to Hunt & Henriques.\n\nHope this helps."

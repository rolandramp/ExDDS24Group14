    "title": "Can my bank account be seized for my husbands civil judgement?",
    "question": "My husband was required to pay federal restitution on a case before we were married. His probation is ending soon and we expect the federal restitution to become a civil judgement. We currently are keeping separate bank accounts. If we continue to keep separate bank accounts, can my accounts be seized for his civil judgement or can only joint assets with his name be taken? I know California is a community property state so just trying to figure it out.",

        "Maybe. Generally, pre-marriage debts of a spouse are not community debts and creditor may not levy assets on non-debtor spouse.\nIf you have maintained separate account and not commingled any of money in your SP account, it cannot be levied to satisfy H debts. Otherwise, your account can be levied.",
        "Yes-- it can be used to pay his debts.\n\nCALIFORNIA FAMILY.CODE SECTION 910-916\n\n\n910. (a) Except as otherwise expressly provided by statute, the community estate is liable for a debt incurred by either spouse ***before or during*** marriage, regardless of which spouse has the management and control of the property and regardless of whether one or both spouses are parties to the debt or to a judgment for the debt.\n(b) \"During marriage\" for purposes of this section does not include the period during which the spouses are living separate and apart before a judgment of dissolution of marriage or legal separation of the parties.",
        "Generally, your husband's premarital obligations do not become your debt. I understand that this is not your factual scenario, but, if you have a joint bank account with someone, their debts can be collected from joint accounts. In your case, if you have a premarital agreement that keeps your incomes as sole and separate assets, then you will be safe depositing your income into your sole bank account. If as I suspect is the case, you and your husband did not sign a premarital agreement to keep your incomes separate, then anything that you earn belongs as an undivided one half to your husband in a community property state. To deposit his portion of your community income into your sole bank account would give the collecting creditor the legitimate legal argument of a commingling of funds in your account. With court permission, this argument could give the creditor rights to levy your bank account. Good Luck!"

        "Dues unpaid prior to the date of filing are discharged. Dues incurred after the date are not. If a lien has been placed on the property by the homeowners association that lien remains unless you are able to avoid the lien in your bankruptcy proceedings. HOA liens in CA are statutory liens and are generally not avoidable. Lien avoidance requires a formal motion.",
        "This is kind of a strange area of the bankruptcy law. Technically, pre-petition HOA's are discharged, but under 11 USC 523(a)(16) HOA dues which accrue after the date of filing remain a personal liability of the debtor \"as long as the debtor or the trustee has a legal, equitable, or possessory ownership interest\". So, until the property is foreclosed upon or sold the debtor remains liable. It's a good idea if a sale is arrranged (short or otherwsie) to include a provision that the debtor (seller) is relieved from any liability associated with the post-filing HOA.",
        "The personal liability for for the pre-petition HOA dues is discharge. If the HOA had a lien before you filed, the lien remains valid and you have to pay it to avoid foreclosure.",
        "It depends on if you are surrendering your property or not. If you are surrendering your house, then you are able to discharge all of the secured debt that is attached to it (i.e. 1st Trust Deed, HELOC, HOA dues, etc.). If properly scheduled, any HOA dues, assessments, etc. that existed at the time of the filing of your petition will be discharged. However, any new dues or assessments that accrue after the date of filing will remain your responsibility until the house is no longer in your name (such as upon the completion of a foreclosure sale or short sale, etc.).\n\nBUT, if you are keeping the property, then the HOA lien is a secured lien against the property just like the other secured liens such as your mortgage (1st TD, any 2nd TD, i.e. a Home Equity Line of Credit - HELOC, etc.). In a Chapter 7 you cannot discharge the secured debt and keep the property too. You can only discharge certain debt secured by your primary residence under circumstances and only in a Chapter 13.",
        "In many instances, when you owe HOA dues, the HOA will have recorded a lien on the property or will have an automatic lien on your property. These types of liens are called \"statutory liens\" because they are created according to state laws or statutes. It makes all the difference in the world to answering your question whether the HOA had a lien on your property, because Chapter 7 does nothing to resolve any lien. If you keep the property, you keep the lien. If you lose the property, the lien goes away. BTW, lots of people want to lose the property but fail to realize that HOA dues continue to accrue after a bankruptcy is filed and those accruing fees are not covered by a bankruptcy dischage. Don't assume that saying you intend to surrender the property to the bankruptcy court is the same thing as actually getting off of the title.\n\nSee, this is sort of complicated, which is why the bar pass rate is so low. Hope this perspective helps!",

    "title": "Wells Fargo denied my loan modification? Who else can I turn to?",
    "question": "I behind 7 months on mortgage payments, on foreclosure. Bank had a trustee sale date but they cancelled. The condo is now worth more than what I owe. I applied for a loan mod but they turned me down stating that I did not provide enough evidence of hardship. I owe about 24k in mortgage and am currently working with keepyourhomecalifornia.com with reinstatement. They require me to ask my lender to modify because they said that even if I am approved, my mortgage with my current loan program is not affordable for me. I have option ARM.",

        "There is a chance that you may be able to ask Wells Fargo to reconsider you for a loan modification and you might be able to provide additional evidence of hardship (if its available). There have been instances of the large banks considering people for modifications more than once. Otherwise, I agree with the prior poster, you should start looking at Bankruptcy or Eviction Defense.",
        "Did Wells Fargo purchase this loan from Wachovia or World Savings? If so, it may be part of a settlement with the US Attorney that mandated Wells Fargo to modify such loans. If not, I think you need to start thinking about saving your home through Chapter 13, which is a possibility if you can pay your mortgage plus your $24,000 back payments over a sixty-month payment plan. If you cannot afford a Chapter 13, then you need to start thinking about Chapter 7, short selling your property, defending an unlawful detainer, or negotiating a cash for keys settlement. Many of us can help with all of these types of options. Best of luck."

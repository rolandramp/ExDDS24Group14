        "I am pretty sure what you intended to state was that you owed $695.00, just less than seven hundred dollars. Correct?\n\nRemember, the Statute of Limitations is a defense to a lawsuit. It does not prevent the lawsuit from being filed. It is unknown if the collection agency that called you will file a lawsuit over such a small amount or not.\nI would suggest not doing anything at all if this is your only debt. If you owe more debt, then maybe consult with an attorney",
        "Generally, statute of limitations for commencing an action based upon a written contract filed in California is four years from the date of the breach of the contract.\n\nYou have not provided information sufficient to determine whether the four-year statute is applicable, or whether the action may have already been commenced.\n\nIn addition, certain loans may be commenced in jurisdictions other than California or under laws different from those of California. Given the substantial amount involved, this sounds like it may be a business loan. That case, the contract may have provided for a specific venue other than California, so that one would have to know where venue was agreed upon, and what the statute of limitations is for that jurisdiction. Other loans, such as Small Business Administration (SBA) loans are subject to six-year statutes of limitation.\n\nAdditionally, there is a body of case law that holds that a borrower can be equitably estopped, i.e., barred, from asserting the statute of limitations based upon inequitable conduct. For example, a debtor who invokes a bankruptcy stay that prevents the creditor from pursuing a lawsuit, only to later then dismiss the bankruptcy proceeding, may be denied the right to claim the statute of limitations based on the fact that the creditor complied with the law and was held at bay and unable to file the lawsuit within the statute of limitations.\n\nFinally, remember that the statute of limitations is an affirmative defense that must be pleaded by the debtor who is sued. Failure to raise the affirmative defense can result in a waiver. There is nothing about the statute of limitations that says the debt is no longer only, only that it is too late to bring a lawsuit due to the passage of time.\n\n$695,000 is a lot of money. With that much on the line, you would be well advised to seek qualified counsel to investigate whether the claim is still viable or may be barred by the statute of limitations.",
        "Statute of limitations on most debts is four years but this may be a special case because %695000 is a lot of money for an unsecured loan.. I suggest that you consult with a bankruptcy attorney to review your options."

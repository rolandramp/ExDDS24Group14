    "title": "Who is liable to pay for funeral expenses?",
    "question": "My 3 adult children's father passed away while living with his girlfriend and lived as tenants in common. He also owned 1/2 of the house they lived in. Were my children liable to have to pay for their Father's funeral expenses? Two of my children did not have a job at the time and the and the only one that could afford to pay for the funeral was not asked to pay.",

        "I'd recommend seeing an attorney to review the specifics. Generally, though, the funeral expenses are an expense of the estate and estate assets can be used to pay for them. However, the administrator still has to include all estate assets on the Inventory and Appraisal, and follow probate code rules in selling any assets. An attorney letter is not sufficient to meet this requirement. Also, she may have a problem if the assets sold were left specifically to individuals.",
        "Attorney Fromm is correct in his statement that the estate is normally responsible for payment of the funeral expenses. Girlfriend has no standing to be appointed administrator of your ex's (assumed) estate and probably got herself appointed because no one with standing objected or applied. If he had a will, she would have been his Executor. It is a little late for your son's or one of them, to petition the court to be named administrator pursuant to statute. However, it is not impossible, and they could step in and straighten out the financial mess.\nWhile the girlfriend is the administrator, she can liquidate the assets of the decedent's estate but she must file an inventory with the court and she must file an accounting. All heirs and potential heirs must be given notice.\nMy advice is to seek legal counsel to help you sort out your family's rights and duties regarding your ex's estate. You need to get your son's to act proactively in seeking to adminstrate their father's estate. As his surviving children and because your ex left no will (appointment of an administrator), they are his sole heirs. It is in their interest to take over the administration. They have statutory priority to be named administrator.",
        "The estate is liable for funeral expenses. Most importantly before assets can be distributed to beneficiaries all debts, takes and other priority items must be satisfied first.

So it could be that the debts consumed all of the assets of his probate estate and there is nothing left for the kids. To be sure the kids need to retain an estates attorney to demand an accounting and a review of the estate administration.

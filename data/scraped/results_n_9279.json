    "title": "Can a Debt Collection agency sue me for a debt?",
    "question": "They are not the original creditors. I don't understand how they are allowed to sue me. The original creditor most likely sold the debt for pennies on the dollar. They are trying to sue for the full amount. What can I do about this? Do they have the right to sue? They are trying to sue me for around two thousand dollars? I am broke and don't have any money and unemployed most likely due to my bad credit. I need some advice should i file for bankruptcy?",

        "Yes, a creditor can sell the debt to a collection agency, and you're probably right about it being for some fraction of the actual debt amount. That agency can turn around and sue you to try to collect, because they bought that right from the creditor.\n\nBankruptcy would make this claim go away, along with other credit card and other unsecured debt, and if your credit is already trashed, and if your debts are big enough, that's an option. But if your debts aren't that big, and all there is is this $2K debt, being broke and unemployed aren't good enough reasons to file for bankruptcy. If you have significantly more debt than this, you need to see a bankruptcy lawyer to discuss you assets, liabilities, potential income, etc.\n\nLinked below is a guide to credit repair, which has sample letters and forms to help settle debts. It's possible you can negotiate this one to something manageable, and maybe borrow some money to pay it back or get them to defer payment til you get a job. Or you might simply not defend a suit (since the contract probably allows them to add their legal fees), and let them get a judgment. The 10% post judgment interest that will accrue, $200/year, is probably less than the interest rate you're paying now on this credit account.\n\nDisclaimer: Please note that this answer does not constitute legal advice, and should not be relied on, since each state has different laws, each situation is fact specific, and it is impossible to evaluate a legal problem without a comprehensive consultation and review of all the facts and documents at issue.

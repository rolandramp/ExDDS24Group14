        "In some districts spending the money on gambling is considered fraud in the sense that depending on the amount and the source of the money using it for luxuries or wasting an asset that the estaate would have acquired could leadd to the Trustee objecting to a discharge. If you took the money out of an IRA then there should not be a problem because it was an exempt source. In some jurisdictions there is case law that supports the notion that gambling is an illness and the addicted cannot control themselves, so should not be denied the discharge. It will depend on how much and what source the funds came from. If you charged the gambling debts that creditor could also object to the dischargeability of the debt.

    "title": "Suspending a cell phone number during a pending divorce.",
    "question": "I am in a middle of a divorce proceeding, divorce documents have been filed with the courts and he has responded. I am the primary account holder for our cell phones. Spouse has been paying his share of the bill every month till now. Now he refuses to pay the cell phone bill. I asked him to remove his phone number off the account or transfer it to another account several times, however he isn't cooperating. I would like to suspend the phone line or transfer the phone number to another phone (cheaper monthly fee), until he takes action. What are the ramification of this? I've asked him to remove his phone line via text (I have a screen shot confirming he read it) and verbally, and still no action taken. Unfortunately, I can't cancel it since it's still under contract.",

        "Not only can't you cancel the contract under the contract that you have but the courts won't let you cancel the contract. While a divorce is pending, the parties must maintain the \"status quo\". This means that the person who made the payments still continues to do so until a court orders something different or the parties come to some sort of agreement on the issue. If you want to remove him off the cell phone contract, your options are to arrive an at agreement with him on this - draft up the agreement and have it signed by the court, or file an RFO and seek orders to remove him off the cell phone contract. You need legal assistance on your divorce.",
        "Ms. Straus is right. You need to read the ATROs. They are on the second page of the Summons and they applied to you when you filed the Petition. You also need to stop and think before you turn something as petty as the telephone account into a battle. It is apparent that you do not have an attorney because a good family law attorney would have a talk with you about what is and what is not worth fighting over. If you are not inclined to hire and attorney to help you concentrate on properly preparing your income and expense declaration and asset and debt schedule for your preliminary (and final) declaration of disclosure. Get your documents together so that a court has an accurate inventory of the community assets and debts. If you are paying the debts keep track of what you pay for reimbursement purposes. The balances as of the date of separation are what is important. Your energy and time are better spent doing what you can to get your stuff together and make arrangements for your new life. Try to keep in mind that family law courts do not punish a spouse for bad behavior (except as may fall under domestic violence) so no one cares that he has a girlfriend. Concentrate on yourself.",
        "Technically, you cannot suspend the cell phone, based on the ATROS. You could change to a cheaper service.\n\nThat said, it bodes very ill for the rest of your divorce if a cell phone is already a battle royal."

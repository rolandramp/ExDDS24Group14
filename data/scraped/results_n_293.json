    "title": "Student loan forgiveness",
    "question": "Iâ€™ve been paying off my student loan of 25000$ for 15 years, for a little hole in the wall beauty school that actually closed 10 years ago. The amount that I owe has never gone down. In 15 years!!! Is there anything that I can do, anything that I can file, SOMETHING, to get debt forgiveness? My payment history to the loan is perfect.",

        "Assuming that you have federal student loans (\"direct\" loans from the government, or loans guaranteed by the federal government): you are in the same boat as millions of others who cannot pay the loans off in 10 years. You may have opted for a \"graduated\" repayment plan to extend the repayment period to 20 years or more, OR you may be enrolled in an income-based repayment plan. In these situations, the payments may cover the interest, or the payments may be less than the interest that is accruing, which means that the loan balance stays constant or GOES UP over time.\n\nUnfortunately most people who have federal loans have no way to discharge them, either in bankruptcy or through an administrative discharge such as TPD (Total and Permanent Disability). If you are not disabled, if you were not the victim of fraud in relation to your education, there is probably no way for you to discharge these loans, based on our current laws. If you are not enrolled in income-based repayment plan, contact your loan servicer to start that process. And, you can advocate for the government to restore bankruptcy protection to all student loans.",
        "A review of your student loan history is imperative to ascertain why this has occurred. You indicate that your payment history is perfect, but I am not sure what that means. Additionally, it is not know at this time if you are dealing with private or Federal Student Loans, or a combination of both. The first step is to look at your student loan report from the US Department of Education. They have a new platform and here is your starting point. https://studentaid.gov/fsa-id/sign-in/landing. If you do not have an account set up, you need to. This will tell you all kinds of information about your Federal Student Loans. Once that is know, options can be discussed. You should, at minimum, contact a student loan lawyer. There are a few of us out there.",
        "The general rule is student loan debt is not dischargeable in bankruptcy. There are some exceptions. Contact AVVO lawyer D.J. Rausa for the best advice. Good luck.",
        "May sound facetious, but complain to your congressman. We need student loan debt reform."

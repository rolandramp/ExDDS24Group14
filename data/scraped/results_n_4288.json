    "title": "Bankruptcy Chapter 13, plan approved, LAM granted. Now what?",
    "question": "I filed for bankruptcy chapter 13 last year. The plan was approved for 36 months. I did not have any debts other than the second mortgage on my home. I filed a motion to avoid the mortgage and it was granted. I will be selling the house the moment I get discharged. My internet research tells me that I have to record the order granting the motion with the county clerk-recorder's office to show that the second mortgage was completely satisfied. Is that true? And also, can I do it before my discharge or should I do it after? Thank you very much.",

        "The lien stripping order should indicate that it is meaningless until you receive your discharge. Under those circumstances, what benefit would there be to spending the money to record a document that is now meaningless. Be patient grasshopper! Hope this perspective helps!",
        "The above is the normal rule. You have to wait. However, maybe the mortgage was so defective that the creditor was merely an interloper....a fraud on the court. In that case, your order would have immediate effect. You may then need to have the order exemplified by the Clerk of the Court so that you can record it at the county. Have an attorney review the underlying facts.",

Is that true?\"\nA: Not entirely.\nThe satisfaction is contingent upon successful completion of the plan, discharge and closing of the bankruptcy.",
        "The 2nd mortgage is essentially not avoided until you complete your Chapter 13 plan and receive a discharge at the end of 36 months, so you would need to wait until then. Once you complete your plan and receive your discharge you should go record the order granting the motion with the county recorder's office."

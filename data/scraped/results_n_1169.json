    "title": "If I file for bankruptcy won't this be listed as an asset and the club be forced to sell it because the money exceeds my debt?",
    "question": "I currently in CA, but but I paid $36,000 for a country club membership while in WA. I asked the club to put it up for sale in 2009, they still have not sold it citing the club will refund one membership for each 3 it sells. I have reviewed the contract, it does state that but also states that they can expedite a sale for financial hardships. I have contacted the club because I am facing foreclosure, they stated the GM has sole discretion on a financial hardship. The GM has not returned a single call (since July of last year) and just sent me an email stating that he won't be issuing a refund outside the 3:1 clause.",

        "The Chapter 7 Trustee may or may not be interested in trying to get the GM to agree to sell your membership. He will \"own\" everything that you own, including the membership, but he also owns your assets subject to the contracts you have signed. So, the GM can hold firm to his analysis. It is an interesting issue, and one I haven't seen before. However, the principle is the same. If the burden of getting the membership sold while maintaining the annual dues (presumably), may be something the trustee may not relish, especially if you exempt a large percentage of the value. He would have to pay you first out of the proceeds of sale. Remember, if you have an ongoing obligation to pay dues, you have an executory contract. So, your question leads to more questions, which is why Mr. Steingraber gave you the excellent suggestion that you seek counsel from an attorney. Besides Avvo, you can find good, local attorneys from the National Association of Consumer Bankruptcy Attorneys at www.nacba.org. If I were a betting man, I would bet the trustee would abandon this asset, and you have to quickly decide whether to assume the ongoing membership contract for membership dues, if that applies. Yet another good reason to hire a good, local attorney!",
        "Your membership is an asset and must be disclosed in any BK petition you file. How much it is worth depends on what other memberships have been sold for recently. It might be worth nothing from other details you post. Depending on the exemption schedule best for you, it is possible to exempt the membership up to $26K using the \"wildcard\" exemption. Consult a BK lawyer in your area. Some Avvo lawyers offer a free consultation.",
        "I concur with the recommendations of my distinguished colleagues. If you have not already retained a Bankruptcy attorney, you need to do so. Despite what you paid for the country club membership, the current value is unknown.

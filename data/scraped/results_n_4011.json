    "question": "Is it true that you can refuse a court summon by writing some legal terminology in a 45 degree angle on the front page and then return it to the sender with the original envelope via certified mail? If yes, what do you write on the front page?",

        "No. This sounds like a scam to me, or maybe yet another variation of the \"sovereign citizen\" nonsense.\n\nIf papers are served upon you or a member of your household (above a minimum age) they you have been served, and it matters not one bit whether you open the envelope or not -- or whether you write something in a 45-degree angle or anything else.\n\nSave your $199 for something more productive.",

But this woman is selling nothing but snake oil.",
        "The refusal to accept the service of a summons and complaint does not get your case dismissed. There are various ways to properly serve a lawsuit.

The failure to respond to the complaint can result in a default judgment being entered against you.",
        "I have never heard of this and I don't see how this is possible. After all, by writing on the summons you are admitting to having received it, thus falling under the jurisdiction of the courts. Perhaps some of the other attorneys on this forum known differently.",
        "You are likely referring to the videos posted by \"colescreditrepair.\" Let me be clear: this individual is practicing law without a license, and, more importantly, is incorrect. Her \"theory\" is predicated upon an inaccurate understanding of the law and the Constitution, and is predicated on the incorrect \"Sovereign Citizenship\" malarkey. She is perpetrating a fraud and a scam. If you have been named as a defendant in a lawsuit, you should speak to a local litigation attorney as soon as possible to discuss your real options moving forward.",

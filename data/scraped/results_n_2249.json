        "My colleagues have given you some great advice. If you are still considering helping your friend out despite their warnings, I would add one additional piece of advice: be a guarantor on the lease and not a co-lessee. If you are a guarantor, the landlord can still sue you for rent under the lease (and damage to the property, etc.). However, you would not be a party to a commercial unlawful detainer action or other potential disputes between the landlord and your friend, who would be the sole lessee. You would also avoid being named in suits brought by third parties (vendors, customers, etc.) who are likely to name a co-lessee on the assumption you are part owner of the business. This at least gives you a lot more control over whether you end up as a named defendant in a lawsuit, which is a public, searchable record that may affect your credit.\n\nHaving said this, I have to echo my colleagues: make sure you are willing to take the financial hit of being responsible for the rent on this property, your legal fees associated with a lawsuit by the landlord (the lease probably contains an attorney's fees clause which means you would have to pay the landlord's attorney's fees as well), the effect on your credit if your friend defaults, and the possibility of getting involved in other disputes with respect to your friend's business if you co-sign rather than guarantee the lease. If you are still willing to go through with this, talk to an attorney before you do so.",
        "All prior posters are dead on. If you want to keep the friendship, doing business together may not be a good idea, generally. More specifically here, what do you get back? A part of the business perhaps? From a non-legal standpoint, I'd avoid it. From a legal standpoint, you would need papers drawn up covering each sides interests, spelling out the relationship, and frankly, if a bank with millions in assets will not see friend as a good risk, why would you?",
        "Co-signing means you put your name and credit reputation on the line to a very high degree and if the business fails, you will be sued on the unpaid commercial lease, which can harm you by many thousands of dollars, for each month not paid. Taxes is the least of your worries, but you should consult with a business attorney and tax accountant to ensure that you are not obligated for any other debts of this business and that you are not creating a partnership with this person, to be liable for all business debts.",
        "The IRS won't know and won't care. Assume the business folds next week. Do you really have the money to pay the rent until the premises are re-rented (under the landlord's duty to mitigate damages) ???",
        "There are many things to worry about here. Much depends on how this is structured.\n\nJust with respect to co-signing or acting as a guarantor on the lease: do you really want to sign up for this liability? It could be huge.\n\nYou should think this through very carefully before signing up.\n\nThis is not a small or casual favor."

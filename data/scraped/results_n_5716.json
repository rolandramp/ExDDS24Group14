        "The bankruptcy \"automatic\" stay will, ahem... STAY the (civil) suit. The stay does to creditors what the same imperative's designed to do to your pooch, except creditors usually comply with the mandate (under penalty of sanctions by the federal bankruptcy court order), whereas dogs are more resistant to discipline and may readily shrug off the lesser penalty of an indulgent owner's half-hearted yank on the collar. (I guess the bankruptcy stay is more like an old-school pernicious doggie choke chain.) Upon filing the bankruptcy case, your bankruptcy lawyer will issue notice of bankruptcy filing and bankruptcy stay to the relevant (Superior) Court as well as to the creditor's counsel, which enables dismissal of the lawsuit. The ensuing bankruptcy discharge (order canceling debt) will void the judgment. Judicial lien avoidance (removal of lien stemming from recording of abstract of judgment) may be accomplished in the course of the bankruptcy case (through separate bankruptcy motion-- not automatically.... as opposed to that whole automatic automatic-stay-business).",
        "If the default judgment was just obtained a few days ago, you may want to consider filing bankruptcy in the next two weeks before the creditor can try to execute on the judgment by recording liens against your real estate, levying on bank accounts, and garnishing wages. Realistically, it will probably take the creditor at least two weeks from the time of the default judgment to accomplish any of the foregoing, and if you file bankruptcy prior to that time, you cut off the ability of the creditor to garnish, levy and record liens because of the bankruptcy stay.\n\nLet's say you wait two months to file bankruptcy, and in the meantime you do nothing to fight the creditor's judgment, and they record a lien against your real property. Depending on the value of your property, the liens against it and bankruptcy exemptions, you can file a motion to get rid of that lien, but most attorneys charge extra fees to file that motion, and if you do not file and win that lien avoidance motion in the bankruptcy, the lien will remain post bankruptcy despite you successfully receiving a bankruptcy discharge.\n\n\n\nMichael Chekian, Esq.\n\nChekian Law Office\n11400 W.

        "As the others have stated, no you do not need to vacate the judgment. The entry of judgment does not prevent it from being discharged. If the judgment is entered and a judgment lien is recorded a motion to avoid the lien will be necessary (in California) which will avoid the lien to the extent it impairs your exemptions. Therefore, one question you would need to address with your bankruptcy counsel is the value of the equity you have in your real property. If they have a prejudgment lien other factors may come into play as far as valuing other assets.

        "As attorneys Chen & Mayor have ssid, no you do not need to file a motion to vacate first. The BK filing will cause an automatic stay to be in place preventing the creditor, or any of your creditors, from doing anything to try to enforce their claim. Also, in California as well, if a lien has already been recorded against your property, then a separate step will be needed to remove it, since the lien otherwise will survive your bankruptcy discharge. That extra step can be a simple motion or a more complicated adversary complaint, depending on the requirements of your jurisdiction. That is why it is always best to hire a local bankruptcy attorney to handle the filing for you so that you can be sure everything is done correctly. Since there already is a judgment, you should find an attorney without delay if you want to try to avoid a lien, wage garnishment, etc.",
        "I agree you do not have to file a motion to vacate any judgment and that you should make sure to include the underlying debt in your schedules. Whether you have to take additional steps once your bankruptcy is filed to avoid any liens against your property may depend on whether you own real property or not. Where I practice judicial liens (which is a court judgment) do not attach to personal property until a writ of execution is issued which is a separate step from just getting a judgment. It is not necessary to avoid a judicial lien by filing a Motion to Avoid a Judicial Lien if the lien has not attached to the property. However, if you own real property, in most states judicial liens attach to any property owned in the county or judicial district in which the judgment was entered and in order to strip that lien you would need to file a Motion to Avoid the Judicial lien and as one of my colleagues indicated, there is usually an extra cost for doing so. Talk to your lawyer about this.",
        "When you file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, make sure the debt upon which the judgment is based is included on your schedules. Assuming the debt is not for a non-dischargeable debt, then the debt will be discharged along with your other debts. There would not be a need to make a motion to set aside default and vacate default judgment.\n\nWhat liens are you referring to, other than a real property lien from a civil default judgment?",
        "You do not need to file a motion to vacate the judgment. The bankruptcy will eliminate the judgment but if a lien has been recorded, there is an extra step (in Florida) to avoid the lien through your bankruptcy case. This is usually an extra charge item so talk to your attorney about it."

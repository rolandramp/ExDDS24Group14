        "First credit card debt is unsecured debt. Second, both you and the primary borrower are responsible for repayment. If the debt remains unpaid, the credit card company can't just seize assets or the primary borrower's social security. The credit card company, or a debt collector, would first have to bring a lawsuit. If a lawsuit is successful, then they would be allowed seize both your assets and income and the primary borrower's. A revocable living trust does NOT provide asset protection.\n\nUnfortunately, insufficient information has been presented (and should not be presented in this public forum) to determine the best course of action. You should consider having a consultation with an attorney to determine if a feasible repayment plan can be achieved by negotiating the principal balance of the debt down and the interest rate. If not, you may need to consider bankruptcy, which again may not be feasible depending on the nature of the assets owned by the principal borrower.\n\nThe links below, especially www.legalcorner.net can provide additional information on your options.\n\nDisclaimer. The above is provided for informational purposes only, does not constitute legal advice, and does not create an attorney client relationship."

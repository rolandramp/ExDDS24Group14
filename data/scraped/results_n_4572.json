    "title": "Can a co-owned car be seized to satisfy a judgment?",
    "question": "My son and I co-own a car. He recently lost a small claims court case and has no income or savings. The only asset he has is this co-owned car that has a substantial balance due on it. I am making the payments but my concern is, could this car be seized to satisfy the judgment if it is co-owned.",
    "answers": [
        "I agree with Mr. Lysle. In addition, note that cars move around at a moment's notice. The Sheriff cannot come seize the car unless he or she knows the location of the car as of a date and time certain. If it's there at the time the Sheriff arrives, he or she can seize it; if not, not. That, coupled with the need for significant equity in the vehicle, makes this one of the least favored judgment enforcement methods.",
        "Co-ownership does not protect the car from seizure. However, there are other protections. First, there is an exemption amount of $2,750.00 of equity in the car. The creditor would need to pay your son this amount. Secondly, the sale procedure is for the Sheriff to seize the car and to supervise its sale at auction. This will cost the creditor about $1,000. Then the creditor will need to pay the exemption amount. Then, any money remaining will need to be paid to the lienholder. At the end of all that, there might not be anything left with which to pay the creditor. Therefore, unless the car is worth much more than the loan balance, it is doubtful that the creditor will attempt to do this.",
        "It seems that it would be unlikely because the judgment creditor would have to take over the payments or sell the car and pay off the balance of the loan, and the other co-owner."

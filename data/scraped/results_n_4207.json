    "question": "I'm a permanent resident in the U.S. Also I'm a Canadian national. I had some debt to the CRA (the equivalent to the IRS) that has been in dispute for a while and still unresolved. I have been living in the U.S since 2006. My question is. Can the Canadian CRA put a lean on my house in the U.S. Or garnish my income or my bank account to cover for the debt. And what would be the extent of their jurisdiction in the U.S.",

        "The issue is whether or not jurisdiction over your property can be had without a judgment from a US Court. Foreign judgments can be \"domesticated\" in the US and then the US court would issue the documents allowing for the lien on your property/assets. Hire a lawyer experienced in foreign debt issues to get the best advice. Click on the \"Find a Lawyer\" tab on the AVVO website. Good luck.",
        "I am guessing that they would have authority. I highly recommend reaching out to a Canadian tax attorney or IRS \"CRA\" specialist immediately if you have not done so already. There are attorneys in the US that specialize in foreign debt forgiveness -- you should reclassify your question as \"tax\" or foreign taxes, etc. Something along those lines so that it will be viewed by the proper attorneys on this board. Hope that helps even if just a bit. Best of luck.",

That being said, the general answer is that the Canada can do something however, practically they often do not\n\nIf you like my answer share my webpage.",
        "If the CRA is like the IRS they do not need a judgment to garnish your wages or put a lien on your house but it would be extremely difficult because they would have to go to a US court to have the debt recognized in the USA. I doubt that the CRA is doing that but there may be an expedited means to do so by treaty. It also depends on how big the debt is. The larger the debt the greater the chance that the CRA will try to track you down. So why not resolve the disputed debt with the CRA now."

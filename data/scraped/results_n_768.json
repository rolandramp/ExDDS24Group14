    "question": "Unfortunately, I have amassed a great amount of gambling debt, and my wife and I currently make too much money to be able to pass the means test for a chapter 7. However, I was wondering if gambling debt can be classified as business debt and be wiped away with a chapter 7. Or if there's a better approach to the debt. Any insight is greatly appreciated. Thanks.",

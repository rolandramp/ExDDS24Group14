    "title": "California LLC formed but never used or canceled need to pay fee's and taxes?",
    "question": "California LLC formed in 2008 never conducted business, had no assets, debts or income and was never canceled and forgoten. Now the Franchise tax board sent us a notice (6/2014) that we need to file for year (2010)and pay penalties. How would I file taxes (back taxes now for years 08-2013) if we never had an EIN#? Will I use my own SSN # for tax purposes? Would I have to amend my personal income taxes for the last 6yrs to include the LLC? What if I do nothing, will the FTB, hold me liable for franchise fee's or taxes? what options do I have? I'm the listed manager/agent of process.",

        "I agree with Dana Schultz, the FTB is only going to continue to send collection letters for so long. You are not personally liable. The only time you can possibly be personally liable is if you co-mingle personal and business funds, or if you under capitalized the business and took distributions or something along those lines, nothing you have done since you never ran any business with it. Also, with due respect to my other colleague, they are not going to let you dissolve the LLC without paying ALL back years taxes and filing ALL back years CA returns. Definitely not worth it unless you are needing the LLC now. As Dana says, it is not the correct thing, but it is the practical path that many a taxpaying in your situation have done. You don't need a lawyer unless you really want to keep the LLC and need to negotiate a deal.",
        "1. The LLC is obligated to pay the Secretary of State (to file a Statement of Information) every two years and the FTB (franchise tax) every year.\n\n2. In a situation such as you have described, many people just walk away, because the obligations are owed by the LLC rather than its founder. This is not what the law requires, but it is a simple, inexpensive, practical solution to the problem.",
        "The answer to your question is, it depends. First, a single member LLC is not required to have an EIN. The LLC files Schedule C with the owner's Form 1040, and encloses Form 568 to account for the LLC's income and expenses.\n\nGenerally, a member is not liable for the liabilities of the LLC. This doesn't mean that the FTB won't ask you for the money. First, they'll try to collect from the LLC, which has no assets. Then they'll come to you. You should get a lawyer because you are in a murky area of law involving an old case commonly referred to as the \"Ralite\" case. It's a 1990 BOE appeal that set forth the circumstances under which shareholders of a corporation could be personally liable for its debts. There has been no later interpretation of this case that extends it to LLC's, but the principles are the same.\n\nSo, before you do ANYTHING, before you respond AT All to any notices, talk to a lawyer who is familiar with this area of law. And you might want to start by canceling your LLC. You can go to the Secretary of State website, find the business entities section, and get form LLC-4/7. You're also going to have to file a final tax return. As long as it's active, the FTB will assess the franchise tax each year.\n\nRemember, your LLC is a separate entity and apparently has no assets. You aren't obligated to volunteer your personal assets to cover its accumulated debts unless certain conditions are met."

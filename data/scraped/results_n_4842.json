        "You have a multitude of minor, vexing problems. I will try to comment in the same sequence is your question.\n\nA shareholder agreement would probably not have been able to provide you with a solution to your problems.\n\nYou have not mentioned the composition of the body that runs your company – the Board of Directors. I surmise that it is you and your business “partner”. That term is inappropriate in the context of a corporation. Please forget the term partner in discussing your situation. Similarly I assume that you two are the only shareholders, each holding 50% of the stock. In which case you must have at least two directors. What do your Bylaws provide?\n\nSpeaking of which: 1) Have you actually issued the stock? 2) Have you filed the Notice of Issuance of Stock with the Secretary of State? 3) Have you filed your statement of Information, listing the directors and officers?\n\nOfficers – President, Secretary, Treasurer – are elected by the Board California law requires that you elect those three officers at a minimum. They need not be different people unless you have more than one shareholder. In your case you need two different people minimum to hold those three offices.\n\nThe evidence of your contributions to the capital of the corporation consists of your initial stock purchase, plus promissory notes, signed by an officer of the corporation.\n\nCompensation of officers is determined by a resolution of the Board. I would guess that you do not have any.\n\nI presume that he wants to buy your shares. That requires both of you to agree to a price and terms.\n\nCompany property is owned by the company if it is paid for with company funds. Company property is 100% owned by the company, not 50% by you and 50% by your associate.\n\nDissolution of the company requires agreement of the shareholders and directors. A minority cannot dissolve the corporation.\n\nIf one of you wishes to maintain the corporation, you will need to rectify the items that I have mentioned above, and I suspect there are others as well. To start, you need to agree on a third director. If you cannot agree on one, you can file a petition in court and have the court appoint one. He or she would maintain that position until the company can function again and all the disputes have been settled.\n\nIf that is not workable, you could dissolve the corporation, sell its assets, and distribute the proceeds, after paying all the debts of the company, including notes owed to the shareholders, to the shareholders pro rata.\n\nThis is a long answer to your question, but it does not cover all the issues. You need a lawyer!",
        "I agree with my colleague that the legal system is expensive and not a great way to solve problems, but I don't think you should just give in to your Business Partner's demands. You should consult with a local business attorney and discuss your options. Perhaps a mediation would serve to resolve the issues between you and your Business Partner in a more amicable fashion. Good luck.",
        "I don't think you have much of a legal recourse without shareholder agreement in place. If you will sue him, your legal fees will eat up anything you have in the company (or not have) and even more of your own funds. (same for him by the way). Try to focus on what good you and him had going when you start the business and compromise. Once you get in the legal system you have no control (very minimum) of the outcome; lawyers and judges will do it for you and in most cases neither party is happy."

    "question": "My husband is 65years old and will retire in 2 years. Am I entitled to 1/2 of his retirement benefits and also Spousal Support? He says I will not need Spousal Support after receiving his retirement benefits. Am in Entitled to get Spousal Support and my share of his Retirement Benefits, so that I can continue to live my life like I have the last 37years? He says I can not afford the house we are living in, then how can he afford to live there? I thought Divorce was an equal split. I have been disabled the last 3 years and collect $980./monthly. This is my entire income. I suffer from P.T.S.D., Severe Depression, Anxiety due to his abuse and receive counceling, which I will need to continue . My 3 adult sons also suffer from Severe Anxiety and Depression. Thank-You",

        "You are entitled to 1/2 of the community property assets and must also be liable for 1/2 of the community property debts. Your spousal support will depend on 14 factors in Family Code Section 4320 but the length of your marriage is definitely a very important factor that the court will consider. Along with his income and you disability, these will also be considered. Strongly suggest that you seek the assistance of a family law attorney to protect your rights.",
        "This forum is really not the place to discuss your case which seems to include complex issues. Yes you will get a portion of his pension. You could get half. The complicated issue is if you get half of the pension how could you then get spousal support on the half he is left with? He most likely would have to have other income for you to get spousal support also. Go in to see a local divorce lawyer. Do not rely on online forums for your answers. Your adult sons will not be part of the divorce case. Why did you wait so long?"

        "Simple: YES. ANY DEBT must be listed in any bankruptcy. Whether that debt is dischargeable, whether you own a house and whether the judgment is a lien against and whether it can be voided are all other issues...but important ones. The fact you are asking implies you have NOT met a bankruptcy attorney to discuss.and that is a huge mistake. You have GREAT ANSWERS BY ATTORNEYS IN CA ..I know all these attorneys answers throughout the years are great, they are knowledgeable, so if near you seek their advice! Most charge NO MONEY to first discuss. Call one today..who knows they might call you back on this Saturday morning.",
        "I agree with the responses from my colleagues and add the following: A judgment can be discharged like any other unsecured debt provided there was no fraud involved in getting the loan to begin with. If there were any irregularities on your part in the transaction, and those can be proven in the bankruptcy court, the debt might be declared \"non-dischargeable\", meaning you would still owe it. Take a look at 11 USC ยง523 for a list of the \"so-called bankruptcy crimes\". If this response was helpful/useful, please leave your feedback on the Avvo website.",
        "Bankruptcy is not filed on specific debts.

        "Your questions is a little vague, but, yes, generally, if you have a judgment against you and you default on a payment plan you set up then you can file bankruptcy to eliminate the judgment. The type of bankruptcy best suited for you will depend a lot on what assets you own and your income, as well as whether you are married and/or have dependents. Ideally you would qualify for a chapter 7 which would stop the garnishment and allow you to eliminate the judgment as well as any other unsecured debt. You want to make sure the judgment is not secured to any real property you may own. Speak with an experienced bankruptcy attorney to discuss your options."

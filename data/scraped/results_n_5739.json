    "title": "Will a handicap placard protect a car from a credit card judgement",
    "question": "I have two cars, one is a 1984 the other 2000, both paid off. The 2000 will have a handicap placard. Her doctor has already signed the forms for the DMV. My mother can no longer walk. I use this car for taking my mother to her doctor's visits or to the store. I am her caregiver, with POA, financial and health. The car is registered to me. If I have a credit card judgement against me, (I don't right now), will that car be exempt for just having the placard?",

        "No, the handicap placard is ineffective against a judgment. To learn precisely what property of yours is exposed to attachment by a judgment creditor, and how to exercise your exemption rights, a consultation with an experienced bankruptcy attorney should meet your needs. Look for one that is not swarming with clients, advertising heavily and expecting you to consult with an \"assistant.\" Many capable bankruptcy attorneys will meet with you personally on a no-cost/no-obligation basis. If you do not know such a lawyer, use the attorney-finder at www.nacba.org.\n\nBest wishes for a favorable outcome, and please remember to designate a best answer.",
        "I am posting a link to a description of the exemptions available for all 50 states. Please note that the California laws contain two forms of exemptions & I believe one only applies in the bankruptcy court setting. Hope this perspective helps!",
        "No, however they cannot repossess the car unless they have a lien against it, which they do not.",
        "I agree with the previous responses - \"no\" a handicap placard by itself offers no protection whatsoever from the vehicle being siezed. However, from a realistic standpoint, I don't see a credit card company with a judgment against you trying to take a vehicle. They may get get an abstract of judgment and record a lien against any property you may have (real property with the County Recorder's Office and personal property with the California Secretary of State), but they will most often try to levy bank accounts or garnish wages before they will go through the trouble of trying to seize a vehicle in satisfaction of a judgment. They also would be likely to place a lien on the vehilce and have the lien appear on your DMV records so that you cannot sell the vehicle without satisfying the lien.\n\nIt sounds from your question that you don't have a credit card judgment against you at this time, but you apparently feel that will be happening. For that reason, I also agree with the previous advice that you should consult with a local bankruptcy attorney (many will offer a free initial consultation) to see if filing a personal bankruptcy may help your situation, protect your assets and avoid a judgment in the first place."

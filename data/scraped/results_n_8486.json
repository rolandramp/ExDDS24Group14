    "title": "Will a bankruptcy stop an abstract of judgement?",
    "question": "I am in the process of filing for bankruptcy. It has not been filed with the court yet as I have just paid off my fees and still need to wait for the final paperwork and complete my creditor class.",
    "answers": [
        "If you file bankruptcy, Chapter 7, the judgment will be discharged, but you will need to file papers to ensure that the abstract is no longer effective. It should not be, because you have no real property, which is the only thing the lien covers and you have none. You may want to ask someone at a local title company or a real estate person what you can file to ensure that if you ever do buy property in that county, that the title company will not try to pay off the abstract of judgment.",
        "You don't specify what kind of debt this was, but most debts (exceptions include those arising from fraud, child support, taxes, etc.) are dischargeable in bankrupctcy. Check with your bankruptcy lawyer to be sure.\n\nOnce you file, your creditors that you list on your petition will get notice of the bankruptcy filing and from that point on, they're required to stop any collection proceedings.\n\nDisclaimer: Please note that this answer does not constitute legal advice, and should not be relied on, since each state has different laws, each situation is fact specific, and it is impossible to evaluate a legal problem without a comprehensive consultation and review of all the facts and documents at issue. This answer does not create an attorney-client relationship."

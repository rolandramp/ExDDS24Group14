    "title": "Deceased-co inventor's right to regain (through re-assignment) patent ownership along with living co-inventors?",
    "question": "My deceased relative was a co-inventor of a patent. The co-inventors all founded a company which this patent was assigned to. Subsequent to my relatives death, the company was dissolved and in the dissolution the patent was declared to have no sale value. Shortly thereafter, the living co-inventors were reassigned the patent and sold it to a patent aggregator for a significant sum.",

        "According to your chronology, when your relative died the company was still operating. To whom was his ownership interest transferred, through what mechanism, and was there a company act that memorialized that transfer? Your relative's ownership interest in the company had to be transferred to and owned by someone before the company dissolved -- perhaps transferred by operation of state law or via the company's articles of incorporation. Speak with a California-licensed probate and estate attorney who will very likely need to consult with an intellectual property attorney. Good luck.",
        "you should seek legal counsel from a local IP attorney and/or estate attorney. Patent ownership often involves state-specific property law issues. It could be that, when the patent was re-assigned to the inventors, your relative's estate should have also received an ownership interest. As the estate administrator, you may also have a duty to investigate this.",
        "Should you be concerned? As the estate administrator, yes; you are a fiduciary and responsible to the beneficiaries for the assets of the estate (even potential assets). That is why administrators can and do file lawsuits on behalf of an estate. As my colleagues point out, there are corporate, probate, and finally IP issues of fact and law involved. You will need investigative and legal efforts and advice to guide, and possibly effect, any pursuit of this potential claim.\nHowever, if each and all of the beneficiaries agree that they do not want to pursue this, get that in writing. Also as a quick rule of thumb, if the amount you might recover is less than $1 million, neither the State nor the Federal tax authorities will have an interest. The estate, and through it the beneficiaries, may have a legal claim -- but not all legal claims must be enforced to the maximum extent allowable. Administrators are also empowered to forgive debts when the balance of benefit and costs do not favor the expressed interests, including the interest in finality and closure, of the beneficiaries.",
        "This is a question that involves both corporate issues and probate issues. You need to consult with an attorney."

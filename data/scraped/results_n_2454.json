    "title": "Can a debt collector collect a debt that was incurred overseas?",
    "question": "I received a traffic ticket in Italy a year back and challenged the ticket using an Italian lawyer. However i never heard anything from lawyer or jurisdiction that ticket came from. Now there is a California based debt collector stating they have bought the debt. I have told the debt collector they have no authority to collect debts from another country. Apparently when I asked them to validate the claim they provided some papers that are, what they say, Italian court papers stating there was a court case, i wasnt there and a fine was issued. I was never served at all in the USA. Can this debt collector chase me for something from another country?",

        "The short answer is that anyone can call you up and ask for money. They don't need some kind of permission to try to collect a debt. If they are collecting a debt on behalf of others, they must follow the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. Other than that there is nothing to stop them from asking you for money.\n\nNow, whether they can do anything beyond just calling you if you don't pay depends entirely on whether the debt has been \"domesticated\". That means turned into a judgment of a california court.\n\nHas it been? Can it be? Those are all questions for which any attorney would need far more facts to answer than you have provided, and are too specific for this kind of forum.",
        "Under Italian law a traffic ticket is an administrative sanction regulated by state law and implemented by local authority (the local police/towns). In Italy there is one centralized collecting agency called Equitalia responsible of collecting on behalf of central, provincial and local governmental agencies. However, many towns are refusing to refer such collections to Equitalia because of the high fees and prefer to use their original collection service (public employees). Regardless, under Italian law a collection must begin with a notice of the existence of a debt. It means that the creditor must attempt to find you at your residence or domicile. If you do not have knowledge or awareness of such debt you cannot dispute that and therefore the collector cannot collect. Now, for a traffic ticket you need to explain whether you have received the ticket in your hands. Because you said you have disputed the ticket through a local attorney, the Italian collecting agency (either Equitalia or the town where the violation occurred) will look at the legal domicile of your dispute that is the office of your attorney. He/she should have received the first collection attempt and you should ask about it. Finally because fines are in the range of few hundred Euro, I highly doubt that a California collector would have bought a claim from an Italian collector (certainly not from a public one) for few hundred dollars. If you still doubts feel free to contact an international attorney. Best",
        "The United States has treaties with other countries that allows foreign laws to be enforced here just as other countries allow parties in the US to collect debt and otherwise enforce the law overseas. The real question appears to be whether or not there was an actual assignment of the debt to the collector. Being served, even in the US, means that the creditor made a nominal attempt to find you. No requirement that a creditor must actually have reached you to deliver legal papers. Hope this perspective helps!",
        "Typically fines, penalties and other government based sanctions from a foreign country may be enforced under the international law of comity. However comity also requires the foreign country to have a specific set of laws that insure fairness before the debt can be enforced in a court in the United States.\n\nThe debt collector can try and collect this fine, or whatever it is, if its a foreign judgment then so be it.\n\nBut in order to do so they will have to file an application for recognition of the judgment first before it becomes enforceable in the U.S.\n\nA debt collector who claims to own the debt, has to prove ownership of the debt.

    "title": "I am involved in litigation to be named remainder beneficiary of a trust. do I declare that as an asset in a chapter 7 petition?",
    "question": "i currently have no access to the trust and possess no ownership interest in its property. i know that being currently named as a remainder beneficiary of a trust is an asset... but what about being involved in a lawsuit to achieve the same end? will the bankruptcy trustee assume the lawsuit since i cannot exempt the prayed-for remainder interest? can the chapter 7 bankruptcy trustee just choose to settle the lawsuit for just enough money to pay my creditors, which is not anywhere near the prayed-for amount?",

        "I agree the above post and would reiterate that, if your financial situation is so bad that you can't wait, but you know that the lawsuit will end up with an award much larger than your debts, then take heart in knowing that you will receive not only whatever amount of the suit you may be able to exempt, but also any surplusage remaining after the non-exempt portion of the award is distributed to pay your debts. In addition, as mentioned above, if the award is not so certain, a Trustee may abandon the case if it drags on and on with little certainty as to a recovery. It's definitely worth a free consultation with a qualified bankruptcy attorney to determine your best course of action.",
        "You must disclose this as an asset in Schedule B of your bankruptcy petition (probably in our response to item no. 20: Contingent and noncontingent interests in real estate of a decendent, death benefit plan, life insurance policy, or trust, assuming the trustor has passed away, if not, then I would list it in the response to item no. 21: Other contingent or unliquidated claims of every nature, including tax refunds, counter-claims of the debtor, and rights to setoff claims.\nGive estimated value of each.) If you have exemptions available, you can apply them to this asset in Schedule C. Since the value is not yet known, it is unknown whether the trustee will pursue the asset or not. The trustee has a number of options. They can hold your case open until the claim is resolved to see if there are non-exempt proceeds to be recovered. They can also have their own attorneys prosecute your claim. Or they can instead choose to abandon the asset. You can file a motion in your case asking the Trustee to abandon the asset if there are grounds to show that the asset is burdensome or of inconsequential value to benefit the estate. In the event the Trustee does not abandon this claim, to the extent there are non-exempt proceeds recovered, they would go to your creditors up to the amount necessary to pay them in full."

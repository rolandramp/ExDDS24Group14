    "question": "PLEASE HELP ME!! Santander, the worst car loan com in history! If we had any idea about this company we never would’ve accepted our loan through them! Young and nieve at the time. SO we had a 72 payment term we are now into payment 83 (we added two payments TOTAL to the end of the loan (one payment each time, separate times) during financial hardship however we made those extra two payments now) and have been forced to continue to pay monthly since then and they still claim we must pay another years worth (12 payments) of $666 monthly! We’ve already paid over $65,000 and by the time they’re done we will have paid almost 80,000 on a $23,000 car. We Can’t understand how this is possible?? we have read through our contract multiple times and cannot make sense of it! we obviously have proof of all of our payments and furthermore they are now reporting us as being late to the credit bureau although we have proof of our monthly payments being paid on time every month please help! They are ruining our credit and HONEST TO GOD WE HAVE PAID EVERY MONTH! Please help! HOW CAN THEY DO THIS? This company currently has a huge class action against them for fraudulent or bad financial practices!",

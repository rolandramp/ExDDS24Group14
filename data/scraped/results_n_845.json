    "title": "Can we file joint Chapter 13 if we are legally separated in California? What is the impact on my alimony?",
    "question": "Legally separated for 3 months, living in different house hold. Husband living in our primary residence. I'm unemployed and only receiving alimony. I'm concern if I will continue to receive my alimony if we file Chapter 13. Will my household expenses be included in the total allowable expenses when calculating for the payment plan?",
    "answers": [
        "Yes. Separated spouses may file joint C13 BK. However, probably not a good idea formany reasons.\nYes. Your SS income and expenses will be considered in determining C13 plan payment.\nYour right to continued SS not affected by filing C13.",
        "Yes, your expenses are included. There is a possible onflict, which you may both have to waive if you want only one bankruptcy attorney.",
        "Yes, you can file separately. Married couples have the option of filing jointly or separately.\n\nIf you file separately, then it is only your expenses that are in issue because you are maintaining a separate household. Your spouse’s separate expenses are not included.\n\nIt appears your biggest concern is about the monthly payment you would be making to the Chapter 13 trustee. That is determined by taking your total gross income from all sources, then subtracting your expenses, and what is left is called \"Disposable Monthly Income.\" (DMI) That number is what determines how much money is available to make monthly payments to repay the creditors, and will be the monthly payment to the trustee, who then distributes it to the creditors according to the Chapter 13 plan.\n\nAny dischargeable debt that remains is discharged, but only if you complete the entire Chapter 13 plan, which can be as long as 5 years. If you get halfway through the plan, and stop making payments, the case will be dismissed and there is no discharge. So you must complete the plan.\n\nAlso, since you are separated, but not divorced, there is a problem with community property. Anything you and your spouse acquired during the course of the marriage, such as equity in the home, equity in cars, or other assets will still have to be listed in the bankruptcy schedules since you still hold an interest in them prior to a divorce. You must talk to an attorney about that. It can have a significant effect on whether a BK is a good idea or not.",
        "Maybe because it's early in the day, but I can't envision any situation or scenario where I would recommend filing a joint chapter 13 with a separated spouse. Your situation is too complicated for casual advice here. You really need to sit down and have a free consultation with a local bankruptcy attorney. Good luck!",
        "First, as a matter of law, I don't believe any attorney can represent BOTH of you when separated in a joint ch 13. You each would need your own attorney as a result of the enumerable conflicts of interest! Assuming you both obtained your independent attorney, and both agreed you both could file a joint ch 13 and all aspects therein, then it is possibly then you could file a joint petition. Never seen it like that in 29 years and over 8000 persons I have helped file. But theoretically it is possible.\n\nSecond, alimony is income to you and an expense to him and continues as far as current alimony. If arrears, then there is the problem and conflicts .\n\nThird, both parties in a joint petition must include all income and all expenses for each no matter what.\n\nFourth, the plan payment is a separate issue and in total each of your expenses can impact the plan.\n\nBut many other issues and facts can affect my advice so I will point out more next so you realize you need to discuss with an experienced bankruptcy attorney your case!\n\nYou need and want to enjoy your fresh start also. But the most important thing is to meet with an attorney as you asking this question means you have not. You care about 2 goals: keeping everything you have equity in and discharging all your debts. If you don't have any of the exceptions to discharge you will obtain that goal; most exceptions are set forth in 11 USC. 523 (Google it) like child support, some income taxes, traffic (in a ch 7) and criminal fines , and presumption of student loans. But some debts are dischargeable in a ch 13 but NOT in a ch 7 so you want to make sure and your attorney will discuss any such types with you also!\n\nYour exemptions depend on what state you have lived in in the last 2 years and thus if in your state, then your states exemptions will apply. Most persons filing keep everything they own but your attorney will confirm that with you when they learn everything you own and the equity thereof!\n\nSome secured debts like homes, vehicles, other secured debts an attorney will discuss your options on also as you must list any debts; but that does not mean you will lose them unless you have too much equity or are in default on paying for them! Discuss those options if they apply with your attorney too.\n\nBut other issues can arise that can greatly harm your case. Just one example: If you paid back a relative $3,000 11 months ago and now file bankruptcy next week, the trustee can SUE that relative to retrieve that $3,000 (under what is called a preference) for the benefit of the bankruptcy estate. As a result, most attorneys don't charge to meet with them the first meeting so meet with one no matter what.\n\nMany great attorneys can be found right here on AVVO in your state so look, call, and meet one as soon as you can.\n\nYou should also want to know when to file: is there an advantage of waiting versus filing now and who should you pay between now and then! Good luck and enjoy your later fresh start.",
        "You can file a Chapter 13 even if you are separated, but that generally would be a bad idea. I presume the alimony is paid by your current husband, so it would be an accounting wash - it comes out of money he earns and goes to you. All necessary household expenses go into the budget in a bankruptcy - you can't live if you don't pay these expenses. This is a complex issue and you may wish to separately consult a bankruptcy attorney. Hope this perspective helps!",
        "The Chapter 13 may not impact alimony at all. To properly answer your questions and address your concerns, the best way to handle this is with an in person consultation with an experienced CA bankruptcy and matrimonial attorney. Use AVVO's Find a Lawyer tool to select a qualified attorney. Good luck. THIS IS NOT LEGAL ADVICE! YOU NEED TO SPEAK TO AN ATTORNEY WHO IS LICENSED IN YOUR STATE FOR LEGAL ADVICE. This is merely suggestions for you to think about in discussing your situation with the local attorney."

    "title": "Would it be grounds for an annulment in california based on fraud that a drug addiction was hidden?",
    "question": "I live in CA i've been married just over a year and within this year my husband has told me of a drug addiction he had had previous to marrying and now while we are married. He also went from a law abiding person to someone who is in a pending trial for being arrested for grand theft auto. I am wondering if i have proper grounds to annul the marriage considering if i had know of this drug addiction i would have never married him and do consider it fraud or if a divorce is easier. We currently have been living separate for the last month. He isn't exactly in of sound mind due to the fact that he is using Meth. I have already had difficulty with getting him to sign anything that would have to do to a divorce.So here i am asking for some advice on what to do.",

The only down side is that if this man has run up a lot of debts you might be responsible for half of them.",
        "It might be if it went to the very essence of the marriage.

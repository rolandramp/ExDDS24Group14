    "title": "What is notice of settlement?",
    "question": "I have back owed HOA's that i am currently paying monthly per agreement with the HOA lawyers. Now , I receive a conditional notice of settlement of the entire case. What does it mean? Do i have to do anything? They scheduled a hearing, do i have to attend? What's going to happen if i dont? Also, i have been paying on time and had been keeping my end of the agreement. Is there a way that i can reduce the debt that they are seeking from me? I only owe them 2500 but with all the fees they added it more than doubled. Is there anything i can do or am i stuck paying them the entire amount?",

        "I agree with my colleagues. Remember, both parties to an agreement can rewrite the agreement at any time - both sides must agree to do that. Often, in this type of agreement the creditor will make offers to settle the payment plan with a lump sum. You can also contact them and offer to settle the matter with a lump sum payment.\n\nWhile you are making payments, the case is still pending. So if you default, thereby violating the Judge's Order, the creditor can ask the judge to hold you in contempt of court, or seek a judgment (at least her in Illinois).\n\nI hope this helps.\nRespectfully,\nSteven A.

        "The HOA attorneys filed the Notice of Settlement in order to avoid personally appearing in court at a Status Conference. They are saying that there is a settlement agreement which will take some time to complete (i.e., for you to pay) and that they want the court to retain jurisdiction during this time so that they do not need to file a new case in the even that you fail to make the installment payments.\nIf you want to reduce the amount of your payments, you should try to re-negotiate the agreement. There is nothing that you can say to the judge that will change the agreement unless the HOA agrees, which is unlikely. However, you might be able to extend the time period for payment.",
        "A Notice of Conditional Settlement is normally a document filed with the court in a pending lawsuit which informs the court that the lawsuit has settled, and that the case won't be dismissed within 30 days, but rather within a much longer period of time (usually because there are conditions which need to be met, such as monthly installment payments).\n\nNormally, the court will take off calendar anything that is currently on calendar in the lawsuit, and set an Order to Show Cause hearing for some date within 30 days of when the last payment or condition should have been met. There is no need for a defendant to appear in court on the OSC date if the defendant has been paying on time.\n\nIt is possible but highly unlikely you can reduce the debt the HOA is seeking, if you already reached a settlement."

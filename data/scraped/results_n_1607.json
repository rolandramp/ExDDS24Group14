    "title": "Does a bankruptcy stay apply to a probate hearing on an conservator ship petition?",
    "question": "If a petition to replace conservator was filed based on elder abuse, abandonment by the conservator, and the conservator filed the BK13 before hearing, does the BK have any baring on the hearing since there are no issues of $$ or property but only elder abuse and abandonment?",

        "One of the questions on the confidential conservator screening form is has the proposed conservator filed for bankruptcy.\nGiving the probate court the BK case number will likely result in the conservator being removed.",
        "The Automatic Stay provisions of Title 11 USC ยง362 operate as a stay applicable to all entities of the commencement or continuation of a process to collect a claim against the debtor; the enforcement of a judgment against the debtor or property of the debtor; any act to create, perfect or enforce a lien against the debtor or property of the estate of the debtor; any act to obtain possession of property of the debtor; etc. As you can see the \"stay\" prohibits acts of collecting debt or property. It would have no bearing on your Petition to replace a conservator.",
        "If you are filing a petition to remove the conservator in probate court, the automatic stay will not apply to those proceedings, as long as there is no claim for payment of a sum of money. You should retain a probate attorney to handle these motions in the probate court.",
        "Your question is unclear. It seems you are saying the conservator is trying to delay the petition based on the BK? If that is the case, certainly there is no basis for that kind of stay of the conservatorship proceeding. If you are going after the conservator's money, the stay may apply. Seek legal counsel."

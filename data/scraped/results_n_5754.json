        "The amount of cash surrender value of life insurance you can exempt in California depends on which exemption section of the California Code of Civil Procedure you are using. The \"703\" series of exemptions lets you exempt upt to $12,860 and the \"704\" series lets you exempt up to $22,950. However, there is also a \"wildcard\" exemption available under the 703 series that lets you add an additional exemption amount of up to a little over $25,000.00. In a situation where you have too much of a non-exempt asset, you might be able to do some pre-filing planning and convert some non-exempt funds into exempt. If you arrange for a consultation with a local bankruptcy attorney, they will be able to sit down with you and look at your entire financial situation and determine the best approach for you under the bankruptcy code, such as a Chapter 7 versus a Chapter 13, and which exemption sections would be best to use for your assets and the value of those assets. As you have found out, a debt that is \"written off\" or \"charged off\" as a bad debt doesn't mean the debt, and your responsibility to pay, goes away. It is merely an accounting term the creditor uses to designate debt accounts they feel they have little or no chance of collecting on. But your liability remains. However, if the underlying debt (in this case your motorhome deficiency) is discharged in a bankruptcy, then the debt, and any related tax associated with the debt (they will send you a 1099C) also goes away. Meet with a local attorney to review everything and do some pre-filing planning and you should have no problems."

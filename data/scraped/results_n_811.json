    "title": "What is my recourse if my ex-wife's attorney is delaying Marital Settlement Agreement?",
    "question": "My ex-wife's attorney and I arrived and agreed on divorce terms on January 25, 2017. Her attorney called court to take of the Feb 3, 2017 Trial Date. However, he has not sent out MSA stating her client is looking for other medical debt to include in settlement. How can this be delayed when she already filed Final FL-142 Asset and Debt Declaration?",
    "question_tags": "Divorce,Dividing debts in a divorce,Divorce and medical debt,Divorce and bankruptcy,Bankruptcy,Debt,Bankruptcy and debt",
    "answers": [
        "If your settlement was put on the record, order the transcript. Call the Court and ask for a status conference re settlement status. Give her attorney a deadline to circulate a settlement draft, after which -- have your attorney do so. If they refuse to sign it, raise it with the Court at the hearing.",
        "Filing the FDD does not automatically create finality. AS to the MSA, the opposing attorney needs time. But you could hire your own attorney to draft an MSA based upon the negotiations.",
        "Asset and debt declarations can require updating. That said, there is an agenda here, as there is/was agreement. Personally, I'd seek to understand the real beef before choosing the nuclear option.",
        "If the agreement is signed by her, then your attorney can enter it into judgment per Code of Civil Procedure 664.6. If not signed, then your attorney should file a request to set a trial date."

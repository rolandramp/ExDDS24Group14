        "In California, HOAs are governed by the Davis-Stirling Common Interest Development Act. Associations are allowed to record a lien but may not start foreclosure until the delinquent assessment is at least $1,800 or the delinquency is at least 12 months old pursuant to California Civil Code section 1367.4(b)(2).\n\nIt sounds like you might have received a pre-lien letter.

In other words, the HOA would have to make payments to the 1st and the 2nd.\n\nhttps://www.avvo.com/legal-guides/ugc/hoa-lien-foreclosure-timeline-in-california?ref=kb_serp_title_1\n\nIn California, there is no deficiency permitted if the loans are purchase money, non-recourse loans. California is best known as a non-recourse loan state that makes it hard for lenders to sue.\n\nYes, if this is your principal residence, you would be eligible under the Mortgage Debt Foregiveness Relief Act of 2007. Under the federal Mortgage Debt Forgiveness Tax Relief Act of 2007 (applicable till the end of 2012), you will not need to pay any income tax on canceled debt (which is the unpaid loan balance that is forgiven by lender) resulting from a foreclosure, short sale or deed in lieu of foreclosure if you as the borrower satisfy certain conditions for mortgage tax relief (e.g., principal residence, owned for at least 2 years, debt amount of $2 million or less). However, the Mortgage Debt Forgiveness Tax Relief Act of 2007 does not apply if the property is not a \"principal residence\". IRS Code section 121 defines \"principal residence\" as: \". . . during the 5-year period ending on the date of the sale or exchange, such property has been owned and used by the taxpayer as the taxpayer's principal residence for periods aggregating 2 years or more. \"\n\nFor more information on debt forgiveness, 1099-A, and 1099-C, see:\n\nhttp://www.irs.gov/instructions/i1099ac/ar02.html\n\nhttp://www.irs.gov/newsroom/article/0,,id=174034,00.html\n\nThere is also an IRS Publication 4681:\n\nhttp://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p4681.pdf",

    "title": "Should my parents file for bankruptcy?",
    "question": "My father is 67 years old and recently suffered a stroke and can no longer work. Both my parents now have severe health issues and will need assistance permenantly. My parents have $100k in equity in their house, $40k 401k and $15k cash. They have $40k credit card debt and are have $7k negative equity in their car. In the coming weeks I am purchasing a larger house and having my parents move in with us. The house will be in our name and my parents will be gifting us the down payment. Our intention is for my parents to live at our house rent and utility free.",

        "As pointed out by my colleague, Lauren Rode, there are several potentially conflicting issues to be addressed. My best advice is to find/consult/hire a lawyer using the Avvo feature \"Find a Lawyer\". Make a list of 4-5 having many 5 star reviews from satisfied clients. If you don't get a prompt call back from one, go on to the next on your list. Some offer a free consultation by phone or in person.",
        "It sounds like your parents could benefit from a bankruptcy, but what are they planning to do with their house when they move in with you? Right now, with them residing in their home, the $100k in equity is likely protected by the 704 homestead exemption. Their 401k will be completely protected. The $15k in cash might not be able to be protected if your parents use the 704 homestead exemption, but that will require some more in depth analysis. If your parents are going to rent the home their live in now, they will not be able to protect the equity in it, and, therefore, bankruptcy would not be a good option for them. They can only protect equity in a principal residence. I would recommend speaking with a bankruptcy attorney to see if your parents would qualify for a chapter 7. They could either keep the car with negative equity, surrender it to the creditor, or try to redeem it for its fair market value. Depending on the situation with their home they might also want to explore a chapter 13. Hope this helps.",
        "You and your parents need to talk to an experienced bankruptcy attorney ASAP to devise a strategy that will maximize your parents exemptions if they file bankruptcy. Your current proposed course of action as set forth in your question won't do that and could cost your parents a lot of money. There is nothing wrong with arranging your parents financial affairs so that they have minimal exposure to their creditors.\nGood luck to you."

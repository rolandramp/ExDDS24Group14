    "question": "It was a car repossession, there was a wage garnishment at one time, but I changed employers. I'd rather pay without my wages been garnished. I did speak with the attorney on the case and I let them know I could pay a certain amount comfortably monthly. I was told they would get back with me shortly. In the mean time, there is possible bank levy and I am considering filing bankruptcy. I would appreciate any general information.",

        "You understand that because you did not respond to the court summons, or if you did respond, you did not show up in court for the trial, the court entered a judgment against you. If you believe that you were not properly served with summons, you should make a motion to set aside the judgment. Your first step should be to get a copy of relevant documents from the court file, especially including the Proof of Service. Then, contact an attorney who regularly represents consumers in debt collection cases.",

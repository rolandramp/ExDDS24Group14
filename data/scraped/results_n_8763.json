        "You may wish to review the notes or other agreements with the student loan lenders, especially the private ones. Some of these lenders have provisions for the increase of interest in the event of late payments or bankruptcy. I am not sure what the effect would be in the event the payments are deferred.",
        "In California you can get the vehicle back by filing a chapter 13 and thereby reorganizing the arrears on the vehicle payment. The situation where you would not be able to do this is where you cannot convince the court that the chapter 13 plan you are proposing is feasible. This would be due to a lack of sufficient income.\n\nYour student loans will be paid at the same rate as your other unsecured creditors in the chapter 13 plan. This will not take the loans out of deferment nor will it stop any accruing interest however.\n\nYes, you can file based on a future job. You would just need to explain this future source of income and make an estimation of what you will be making at the new job. The trustee and/or judge will eventually, most likely, require proof of your actual income once this job starts before your plan will be confirmed.\n\nYour credit is basically destroyed by filing the bankruptcy. However, since your credit is already \"terrible\" this is of no consequence to you. Your credit will build slightly during your time in the chapter 13 bankruptcy (3-5 years) but nothing very significant. You also are not permitted to take on new debt (like a house) while in the chapter 13 plan unless you obtain court permission. However, once you are out of the plan, you can build your credit quickly. Eventually you will be able to buy a house. Typically by the time you are in a financial position where buying a house would be advisable, your credit will not longer be an issue.\n\nThe last question depends on way too many factors to answer here. You should speak to a licensed bankruptcy attorney to assist you in making that determination.\n\nNicholas Wajda is a California licensed attorney at Price Law Group, APC.

    "title": "Sole Proprietorship is failing, in danger of losing my home, what should I do?",
    "question": "My business (Sole Prop) is failing. My personal funds are depleted and I am now in danger of losing my home. I need to close the business and find a job so my home does not go into foreclosure. The only contract I am in danger of defaulting on is my lease agreement for the space. I have no other debts tied to the business other than payroll & taxes. I'd like to know what my options are in regards to the lease agreement (valid thru 2013), as I really don't want to file bankruptcy. Would bankruptcy even protect me from having to pay the lease?",

        "First of all, sorry about our situation - it's very common in this current economy.\n\nYou can attempt to negotiate your lease away by paying a penalty - talk to you landlord about the situation and explain it is either coming to an agreement or you may be forced to file bankruptcy - do it in a nice way. If it is a popular locaiton the landlord maybe able to just re-rent it and then he/she wouldn't have any damages and you would be off the hook.\n\nIf you have to file bankruptcy, then the lease would be ended and you would be off the hook normally.\n\nGood luck with your situation. The above is general information and not advice.\n\nMatthew Williamson"

    "title": "Should the trustee rent our my mother's home & charge my sister rent & can the rent from my two properties be used to pay bill?",
    "question": "My sister inherited two properties from my mother. One property is the home my mother lived in and the other property is where my sister has lived rent free for the last eighteen years. Two years ago my mother amended her trust and said the free rent was a “gift” to my sister for helping her out with personal care. My mother passed away last month and the trustee is not renting out my mother’s home nor is she asking my sister to pay any rent. I inherited two properties from my mother which have both been rented out for the last eighteen years. The trustee is telling me they can’t transfer title on the properties until the estate is settled because they need the rent from my two properties to pay bills. My mother also has over $500,000 in liquid assets that could be used to pay bills.",

        "Please see the first link, below, my sample letter #1.1, which you can send to a debt collector, even if the collector is also an attorney. Be sure to send it by certified mail.\n\nBefore they can have a judgment entered against you for money, the collection attorney must do the following steps:\na. file a lawsuit,\nb. have a process server deliver to you the lawsuit preferably in person,\nc. file the proof of service with the court,\nd. ask the court for a default and default judgment if you wait more than 30 days from date of personal service or 40 days from date of substitute service.\n\nIf you do not dispute the debt and you believe that a lawsuit filed soon would still be within the applicable statute of limitations, then now would be a good time to see if you can get the debt settled before they sue you,. This would save on expensive court costs and having to hire a lawyer to represent you. Please see my legal guide on Avvo on how to settle a debt collection lawsuit, which you can access for fee through my profile on Avvo.\n\nIf they do serve you, that is yet another opportunity to either settle the debt or retain legal counsel to assist and advise you. Sometimes these debts cannot be proven in court, even if you have no actual dispute. My law firm represents consumers throughout California.",
        "The law firm is a debt collector and as a result must send the same identical language that any collection agency would. You can send the validation request if you like, but keep in mind that the account is now in the hands of a law firm, or a lawyer working for Chase. The next logical step is that a law suit will be filed. That may or may not occur, depending upon the amount of the claim. I can tell you that in my jurisdiction, Chase has in-house counsel, which means attorneys working on a salary solely for Chase, so they tend to be more aggressive in bringing claims into Court than, say, a credit card account having to pay money out for collection. When there is in-house counsel, the salaries are paid regardless of the number of cases filed.\n\nPanic is not helpful. Can you afford to set up payments? If the answer is no, then there is not much you can do with the creditor. You may wish to consider bankruptcy as an option, and should consult with an attorney in your state familiar with credit issues and bankruptcy practice.\n\nGood luck.\n\n\nThis response is not intended to be construed as legal advise regarding state-specific laws other than those in the State of Florida, and it is also not intended to create an attorney-client relationship or the expectation that a follow-up question will be answered."

The response is in the form of legal education and is intended to provide general information about the matter in question.

        "There are many issued not considered in your question but are very important.\nHow much do you both make. If you are making too much together, your soon to be husband will not be able to file chapter 7 liquidation.\nTo start off with a new slate, file the bankruptcy first, than get married the next day. Assuming you both make less the the limit when considered together, marrying your boyfriend will not cause you to be liable for his debts but don't put your assets together until after bankruptcy. If you can buy a house without your prospective husband's income, buy the house before the marriage. It will be harder in this market to get low interest with husband seek loan after bankruptcy.",
        "Agreed.\n\nAlso, ask yourself this - how can you afford to purchase a home if $10K in old debt is too much of a burden to overcome? Please be honest with yourself and with your fiance - it will make sure you are not in this position again.\n\nGood luck."

    "question": "I received a notice of frozen benefits due to a response supplied by the Temporary Agency I once worked for. When questioned by the EDD as to why I was no longer employed, they have only 2 responses; 1. Found another job; 2. Put on temp to perm position. This unfortunately was not the case and EDD was told I \"Quit for another job.\" Frozen benefits. When I contacted the agency I was given a letter to clarify that because they \"the agency\" removed me from the payroll systems because I found work (another temporary position) I did NOT quit. Bottom line, due to this small play on words I will be penalized by creditors due to late payments, rent etc. Can I try to claim $ for help repaying past debts bought on by the error?",

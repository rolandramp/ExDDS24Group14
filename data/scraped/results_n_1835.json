    "title": "How do you prove that money given to a person is a gift?",
    "question": "My mother passed away 5 mon. ago. She was 85. In going through her records I found that she wrote checks over the years to my brother or on his behalf (for his business) totaling approximately $1,000,000. He is now claiming a substantial amount of that total were gifts. I believe they were loans. Who has the burden of proof? Does he have to prove it was a gift or do I have to prove it was a loan? Can I go after him for financial elder abuse? She was taking Namenda since 8/2011. Is that enough to demonstrate diminished capacity?",

        "Many factors and proof elements are available. Some, not all, include:\ncapacity at time money was transferred, sheltering, oral statements, promissory notes, letters, writings, check notations, check registers, gift tax returns, income tax returns, trust documents, powers of attorney.\nCalifornia law presumes a gift in circumstances you describe.\nInitial burden of proof on you. However, under probate code you may be capable of shifting burden to brother.\nYes. Facts cited suggest possible elder abuse.",
        "First, even before you get to this. who is the administrator of the estate? Was there a Trust? Of if not, was there a Will that was submitted to probate. Did the court award someone Letters of Administration? You might not have any legal standing to do what you want to do right now. Get help from a probate attorney.",
        "Under California law the presumption is that the money was a gift.\nYou are going to need to prove that they were not gifts, but were a loan or an advancement on his inheritance. If you can prove elder abuse, you may be able to disinherit him.\nGet all the facts together and any documents. If you can, it will help if you know what the money was spent on. was it paid for gambling debts or something else?",
        "If there is this much money at stake, you really need to take the records you do have to an attorney to determine how best to proceed and what you might be able to claim as loans. Elder abuse may be difficult to prove, but if there is evidence of a loan, some may be recoverable. Many attorneys give free consultations so you may be able to get some good information on how to proceed by contacting and discussing the facts with one. Good luck.",
        "I agree with Mr. Jones. A loan, gift or early distribution may be factors to consider for purposes of effecting your brother's share to the estate should he be a beneficiary. However, it would be your burden to prove financial elder abuse by filing a Petition in probate court, in terms of actually establishing that the money taken by your brother was not, in fact, a gift, but rather a product of fraud or undue influence. Establishing diminished capacity would undoubtedly require some medical testimony.\nDISCLAMER: The information provided by WFB Legal Consulting, Inc. is disseminated for educational purposes only, and is not to be construed as legal advice.

        "promissory notes, letters, writings, check notations, check registers, gift tax returns, income tax returns, trust documents, Powers of Attorneys all constitute evidence that you will want to review in determining whether they were gifts or loans. testimony of percipient third parties will be helpful too. the burden is always on the plaintiff to prove elder abuse. may want to consider an 850 petition. take all of the documents you have and review with an attorney. It will be well worth the few hours you spend. good luck.",
        "Were there any writings involved besides the checks? Was anything written on the memo section of the checks?\n\nA true loan would have a promissory note and interest being paid. Is there any evidence of any of that?\n\nA gift might also have a greeting card or a letter with it. Is there any evidence of that?\n\nThe burden of proof of a loan is on the estate."

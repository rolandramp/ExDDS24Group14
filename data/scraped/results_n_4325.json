    "question": "Hi, I have several Finra licenses series 7,63,56,4,86,87... that I worked hard to earn. I've had a hard time finding work over the years, exhausted my savings, and have a bunch of credit card debt, as well as a judgment against me now. I recently got a job that requires me to have a series 7. If I file for ch7 bankruptcy, will my licenses be revoked?",

        "Tough to follow-on Ronald's detailed answer. The simple answer is that you will not have the problem with the license, itself. Bankruptcy will not cause you to lose the license. The issue will be with the broker-dealer and whether they will allow you to operate with them. In y experience, despite the obvious concern, I have yet to have a person with your licenses and working in field either lose a job or be unable to get a job because of a bankruptcy.",
        "Your licenses should not be revoked, but be fully aware that if you are currently registered with a member firm you will have to disclose the Chapter 7 bankruptcy. Certain states may request that you be placed under special supervision, which may affect your payout if you're landing with an independent firm. But can an employer terminate you solely because of the bankruptcy? I wouldn't think so, given that your Form U4 requires a stated reason for termination from your then former firm.",
        "I concur with attorney Cook's analysis.",
        "FINRA's stated goal is to protect the public from unscrupulous brokers; as such they require that broker-dealers monitor certain aspects of their representatives' financial well-being, such as if they file bankruptcy. The primary requirement set forth in regard to a registered representative filing bankruptcy is that they disclose the filing to the broker-dealer they work with. This is done by the filing of an amended Form U-4 and must be done within 30 days of the bankruptcy filing. The broker-dealer is held responsible for making sure this information is amended and properly filed with FINRA. The amended U-4 is filed electronically with FINRA. Filing bankruptcy does not disqualify an individual from being a registered representative. Although they are required to disclose the bankruptcy filing on their Form U-4, it is basically done for administrative purposes and does not alter their ability to work in the industry. They may still become registered or continue to be registered if they file bankruptcy after being a representative. Each broker-dealer has their own policies and procedures regarding how they will deal with a representative who files bankruptcy. They may choose to more closely monitor that individual's work and interaction with clients to ensure it does not affect their performance. However, broker-dealers do not necessarily treat registered representatives that file bankruptcy any differently than other representatives. FINRA does not regulate what a broker-dealer must do after a representative files bankruptcy. It is at the discretion of the broker-dealer. Although there are no regulations set forth by FINRA in regards to a representative filing bankruptcy (other than the disclosure requirement) broker-dealers are ultimately responsible for the actions of those contracted with them. Therefore, broker-dealers are expected to keep an eye on their representatives to make sure their personal financial situation does not interfere with their professional responsibility to their clients. They also have to make sure the broker is acting in good faith and doing what is in the best interests of her clients."

    "title": "Can I sue my ex-wife for this since it is outside of the divorce proceedings?",
    "question": "During our separation, ex rented out a property. I was not involved in this whatsoever. Tenant abandons the property after owing 3 months rent and trashing the place. I am awarded the property in a divorce. I am taking care of the default because in the agreement, we are to hold each other harmless for encumbrances owed to a third party (CHASE MORTGAGE) which leaves me to cure the default on my own although these were her tenants. I did not learn of the default until taking possession of this property. Regarding her tenants trashing the place (broken windows and kitchen cabinets, ruined flooring, holes in walls, busted interior doors, etc), can I go after my ex and have her reimburse me for these repairs and than she could go after the tenants since she had the agreement with them?",

        "This would still be a FL matter under the terms of the divorce.",
        "If she knew about this and did not disclose it it may be considered omitted debt and actionable in family court.",
        "Failure to disclose is actionable. If she knew about it bring it before the court. Schedule a consultation with a family law attorney. Best of luck.",
        "I would expect that your judgment also states that all debts, liens, encumbrances, etc. have been disclosed and that the waiver relates to encumbrances not currently known. If your ex wife knew of the damage and encumbrance, but failed to disclose those facts and evidence when or prior to your agreement being reached, you can bring the matter to the court's attention in the family law case. There is no need to file a separate action. Her failure to disclose is a breach of fiduciary duty and sanctionable in an amount that could reimburse you for having to pay off the encumbrance. If however, she did not know about the encumbrance, and you waived reimbursement, you are stuck with what you got."

    "title": "How can I file for bankruptcy immediately?",
    "question": "Employer has informed me (during sick leave) that I will be terminated. I need to file for bankruptcy based on multiple notices that I will be sued from debt collection agencies. I need to do this before I am terminated upon return to work where I have been informed I will be terminated.",
    "answers": [
        "As you can see from the answers posted, your best action is to consult immediately with an experienced bankruptcy attorney (some of us offer a no charge initial consultation). With that information and analysis, you can then understand your situation better and will be able to make a decision on how to proceed. Bankruptcy may be your best option, but there are many factors to consider before taking that step. Good luck.",
        "No hurry, gather your notices, bills and speak to an attorney.",
        "I agree with the 1st answer that there is no emergency. AND other issues could greatly affect your case too. \"Notices\" are not lawsuits and thus you have plenty of time to plan. Why not call the CA attorney who already answered if close enough to you? Or find one on AVVO here.\n\nYour asking that question implies you have not called and discussed with an experienced bankruptcy attorney near you as you would or should know the answer to that question posted here on AVVO. Other facts and issues can gravely affect your case so I will point these out for you next some issues so you know you only need to do one thing now: call an attorney near you to discuss bankruptcy. You need and want to enjoy your fresh start also. But the most important thing is to meet with an attorney as you asking this question means you have not. You care about 2 goals: keeping everything you have equity in and discharging all your debts. If you don't have any of the exceptions to discharge you will obtain that goal; most exceptions are set forth in 11 USC. 523 (Google it) like child support, some income taxes, traffic (in a ch 7) and criminal fines , and presumption of student loans. But some debts are dischargeable in a ch 13 but NOT in a ch 7 so you want to make sure and your attorney will discuss any such types with you also!\n\nYour exemptions depend on what state you have lived in in the last 2 years and thus if in your state, then your states exemptions will apply. Most persons filing keep everything they own but your attorney will confirm that with you when they learn everything you own and the equity thereof!\n\nSome secured debts like homes, vehicles, other secured debts an attorney will discuss your options on also as you must list any debts; but that does not mean you will lose them unless you have too much equity or are in default on paying for them! Discuss those options if they apply with your attorney too.\n\nBut other issues can arise that can greatly harm your case. Just one example: If you paid back a relative $3,000 11 months ago and now file bankruptcy next week, the trustee can SUE that relative to retrieve that $3,000 (under what is called a preference) for the benefit of the bankruptcy estate. As a result, most attorneys don't charge to meet with them the first meeting so meet with one no matter what.\n\nMany great attorneys can be found right here on AVVO in your state so look, call, and meet one as soon as you can.\n\nYou should also want to know when to file: is there an advantage of waiting versus filing now and who should you pay between now and then! Good luck and enjoy your later fresh start.",
        "The pending termination of employment alone shouldn't create a rush to file for bankruptcy. A good start is to take advantage of a free consultation that are offered by most bankruptcy attorneys. During that consultation the attorney can help you through the process and stop the collections notices. Bankruptcies can be filed very quickly on an emergency basis."

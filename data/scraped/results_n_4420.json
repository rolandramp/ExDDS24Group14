    "title": "When I fill out my FL 150 (I&E) at the section where it asks for average monthly expenses, do I include my gasoline expenses",
    "question": "even though I calculated these expenses as my business expenses as a self-employed person to plug in my net figure on the form where it asks. AND, where it asks me to list real and personal property can I just note to see me Schedule of Assets & Debts as there is no room on the FL-150 to complete this and I am unsure if I am to list my half of community property?",
    "answers": [
        "I recommend not listing the gasoline expenses because they have already been listed - as deductions - from business income. As previously posted, you are required to only estimate the \"value\" of the property - not a listing of specific property.",
        "FL-150 does not ask you to list properties, it asks the value of the properties only.",
        "There is a self help desk at whichever court you will be filing at. You need to go get help filling out these forms at that self help desk.\n\nBut yes, you must put all those expenses on the form. The two forms are completely separate. Also if you look carefully at the asset for me you will see that each item must be listed and then you must state whether it is community or separate.\n\nHowever, I'd like to also point out that as a self employed person you are going to run into difficulties with your income issues and whether they will stand up in court."

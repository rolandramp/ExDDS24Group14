        "I am not licensed to practice law in California. The term validation and and verification are used in the fair debt collections practices act and are used interchangeably as the act refers to both validation and verification. See 15 U.S.C. ยง 1692g. The act does not define \"validation\" or \"verification\" or what you need to show it. There have been cases all over the board and you would need to see how your courts in the 9th Circuit view it.\nMost of the fuss about validation supplied by a debt collector concerns debts bought by junk debt buyers who frequently send what is plainly inadequate validations as they are nothing more than made up statements showing the name of the creditor and balance owed. In cases where a junk debt buyer owns the debt rather than an original creditor, to be proper, a validation should contain either a copy of a credit card statement from the original creditor and/or an affidavit or bill of sale showing that the debt was sold by the original creditor to the junk debt buyer. If the debt was sold more than once then you need the proof for each buyer in the chain of title.\nIn connection with your situation, you indicate that you will be contacted by either the HOA or a law firm assigned to collect the debt. That means that you have an HOA. If you still had one, then this is serious. I am licensed in NC and GA and there are specific laws in both states which allow the HOA to place a lien on the home if the HOA dues are not paid. If the dues are still unpaid after the lien is filed, then the HOA can foreclose even if the property is mortgaged. Further, the HOA can recover counsel fees. I do not know if the law is similar in California but I suggest that you talk with a real estate litigation attorney in your area about this.\nFurther, if the HOA contacts you, then they are not bound by the debt collection practices act and your request for validation/verification is inapt. You need again to speak with a California attorney. There is undoubtedly a code which governs HOAs and there are specific requirements which have to be met before they can file a lien. Those provisions will govern, not the fair debt collection practices act. However, there may be a law in your state that provides some protection from original creditors - for example, they may not be able to call you at your job if they know not to do so or they may not be able to contact you at all if they know you are represented by an attorney.\nIf a law firm contacts you, they may be considered a debt collector under the fair debt collection practices act. They may send you a warning letter and ask you to pay or else they will pursue further action. If you really do not know what you owe and how its calculated, you can dispute and ask for validation/verification. They will probably have the HOA send you a statement indicating the balance owed and any late fees, interest or attorney fees if proper.\n\nRather than focus on using the right language, you need to think about how you intend to ultimately resolve this especially if they can recover legal fees. In such case, you will be paying the HOA dues and their legal fees so don't do anything that is going to add to these fees unnecessarily. By all means, I don't want to discourage you from exercising your legitimate rights. Just don't try to be clever because in the end you will only make things worse for yourself."

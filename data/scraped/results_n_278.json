        "If you can show that 1) over 4 years passed between your last payment and the recording of the lien; and 2) you never verbally or otherwise agreed to extend that statute of limitations, then the creditor may be violating the statute of limitations (4 years for written obligations) .\n\nHowever, usually the lien follows a judgment, or a written agreement. A creditor can't walk into the County Recorder, and announce that he has a lien on your property. So, you need to be sure that the creditor does not have a mortgage agreement, promissory note, or default or other judgment that underlies the lien.\n\nGood luck.",
        "If there is a lien, there is a judgment. It means that the debt collector sued you and obtained a judgment against you.\n\nIt is entirely possible and unfortunately quite common that this could happen without your knowing about it, because a great many debt collectors have used and continue to use shifty practices in connection with serving summons.\n\nYou could be a victim of the phenomenon known as \"sewer service.\" You need to speak with an attorney who is knowledgeable about vacating default judgments entered against people without their advance knowledge.",
        "You are probably trying to refer to a 4 year statute of limitation to file a lawsuit on a contract. You should first determine if a lawsuit was filed against you. Generally, if there is a judgment lien recorded, it would reference the case information as well.",
        "There is probably a judgment against you, that you are not aware of. You need to retain the right type of attorney to represent you in this case. Depending on your overall financial situation, Bankruptcy may be right for you. An experienced CA Bankruptcy attorney will be able to determine which type of Bankruptcy, if any is the correct one for you. Use AVVO's Find a Lawyer tool to select a qualified attorney. Good luck. THIS IS NOT LEGAL ADVICE! YOU NEED TO SPEAK TO AN ATTORNEY WHO IS LICENSED IN YOUR STATE FOR LEGAL ADVICE. This is merely suggestions for you to think about in discussing your situation with the local attorney.",
        "Generally, even though the bill is over 4 years old, you have to check if you were ever sued and if there is a judgment against you as that is the only legal way they can put a lien on your house. Search the public court records in your county if there was a lawsuit against you. If not, the lien is void. Goodluck to you."

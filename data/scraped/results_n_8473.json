        "Issuance of the 1099-C is dependent upon the bank deciding to forgive the debt and foregoing pursuing the deficiency balance after the sale. If the bank does issue a 1099-C, then the debt forgiven on your principal residence is generally eligible for exclusion both federally and with the state. However, because you used debt taken out to pay personal expenses (i.e., purchasing a car), that amount will not be eligible because it was not reinvested into your principal residence. What you sold the car for should not impact this. You should meet with a tax advisor upon getting a 1099-C.\n\nClick \"thumbs up\" if you've found helpful and/or informative.\n\nDISCLAIMER & IRS Circular 230 DISCLOSURE:\n\nThe information in this answer is for general information purposes only.

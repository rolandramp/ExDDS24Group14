        "A leased car is an executory contract under Schedule G. You will list the lease there and you also have to fill out the Statement of Intention to signify if you will assume or reject the Lease.\nYou do not own any interest in the car so there would be no place for it on Schedule B or Schedule C. You would be allowed a car deduction on the Means Test for your payment."

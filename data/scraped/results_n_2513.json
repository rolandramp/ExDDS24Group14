    "title": "Filed bankruptcy in 2011, had Cash Call Loan & they sued, then dropped suit, & sold debt to their other company. Is this Legal?",
    "question": "Ok, filed bankruptcy in early 2011, Cash Call was one of my debts. They sued a month or two later, but dropped the lawsuit after the bankruptcy hearing. I expected them to show in court, but they didn't, and my bankruptcy was finalized. After the discharge, Cash Call dropped the lawsuit. Now when I was checking my credit report I see they sold the loan to Greater California Finance, which in short is an arm of Cash Call. How can this be legal? It's just a shell game to these 2 companies.",

        "If you listed the Cash Call debt in your bankruptcy petition, and you received a discharge order from the bankruptcy court, then Cash Call or an assigned debt collector cannot attempt to collect or enforce that debt against you. The discharge injunction of the Bankruptcy Code 524(a)(2) prevents such collection. Note: if the loan is secured by property, then they can still go after their security interest, but your loan sounds like a typical unsecured debt.\n\nYou should contact Greater California Finance and provide them with a copy of your discharge order and demand that they desist. If that doesn't do the job, contact your bankruptcy attorney or on here on Avvo in your area to pursue options such as sanctions for violating the discharge injunction. Good luck.",
        "While I agree with my colleagues that the discharge injunction applies to this debt and you should be able to raise your bankruptcy discharge as an affirmative defense in the event you are sued, be aware that you will have to answer any complaint that may be filed. You may also need to reopen your bankruptcy case and file an action against whatever creditor has filed suit against you for violation of the discharge injunction or for violating the automatic stay. Some districts handle these sorts of things differently so ask your attorney what steps to take. BTW, I think that there should not be any sort of open credit line notation on your credit report for this debt. It should be reported as having been discharged in a bankruptcy. You should be aware that Cash Call routinely sells discharged debt and they frequently do stuff like this.",
        "Once the debt to Cashcall got discharged in your bankruptcy, nobody can collect this debt anymore. Attempts to collect a debt that got discharged in bankruptcy may subject the creditor for payment of damages and attorney fees, if the Debtor bring an action for violation of the discharge in the proper bankruptcy court. It could be that your rights had been violated if the amount of the debt appears on your credit report as negative information without a notation that the debt got discharged in your bankruptcy.\nReporting a debt that got discharged to the credit reporting agencies is an impermissible collection action. You probably want to dispute the accuracy of the credit reports by sending a dispute letter to the credit report agencies and showing that the debt was included in your bankruptcy discharge. You also probably want to send a demand letter to Greater California Finance and demand that they stop all collection actions including reporting the debt to credit report agencies.

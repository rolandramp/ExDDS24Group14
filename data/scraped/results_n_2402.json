        "Hi there. The interest rate on your auto loan will not be reduced automatically by the filing of the bankruptcy. In fact, you would not be permitted to lower the interest through a cram down in the chapter 13 plan as you have purchased the car recently. However, your attorney may be able to negotiate a lower interest rate with the lender after filing. So you should explore this option before turning the vehicle back in. In terms of how this will affect your trustee payment, it largely depends on whether your annualized income exceeds the median for the sate. If yes, then having no car payment will increase your trustee payment significantly as you would not be able to claim auto ownership cost. My recommendation would be to replace this vehicle with another with a lower payment. This way, you can still claim auto ownership cost and hopefully lower your monthly payment to the trustee. However, I agree that chapter 13 matters are more complicated and you should consult an attorney before filing. Good luck!",

        "In a well crafted Chapter 13 Plan your interest rate will go down to what is referred to as the\"Till\" rate. Most attorneys think that is prime rate + 2% or a total of 5.25% interest.

I and other attorneys regularly get plans approved at 3.25% + only 1.5% for risk factor to be a total 4.75%. It is not unusual to get 4.5%.

    "title": "Hello, I'm wondering if I can omit a cosigned PERSONAL student loan from my chapter 7 bankruptcy case?",
    "question": "I am thinking about filing for Ch. 7 bankruptcy, no asset. I have all my paperwork ready to go but I have 2 loans that are cosigned by my uncle that I would like to leave off and continue paying. I know that student loans will not come off anyway so should I leave it on there or leave it off? Does it matter b/c student loans aren't affected by bankruptcy? The 2 loans were through fafsa but was not provided by the government, it had to be a personal loan that was cosigned however the loan clearly states that it was a student loan. The loan was then split into 2, one half going to Citibank N.A. and their student loan department, now transferred to FirstMarkServices and the other to Discover Student Loans.",

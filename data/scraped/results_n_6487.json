    "title": "Should my 80 year old mother file bankruptcy? She has $12,000 debt, $8,000 we believe is fraud.",
    "question": "Mother's income Pension and Social Security $1,600 a month. A collection attorney has contacted my mother. Judgements have been filed with the courts in N.J. on these accounts. A levy has been placed on her checking account. She owns no property, cars. etc. She moved to California a year ago.",
    "answers": [
        "If, by filing, your mother would feel more at ease, then maybe it is a good idea to file. I would rather her go through bankruptcy and be done with it than have creditors constantly harassing her, and in a time of stress, she is further taken advantage of. Good luck.",
        "A bankruptcy would certainly be a quick answer to the variety of questions you pose. The simple fact is that bankruptcy is a bit expensive, especially for someone with monthly income of $1600. Mom my file, but my bet is that you and your siblings will be paying for it. Have you tried a cease and desist letter to collectors? Lawyers count as collectors too.\n\nIf you skip the bankruptcy route you will need to be vigilant as to attempts to attach Mom's exempt funds from her bank account.",
        "To obtain the answer of whether or not to file, should be determined after consulting with experienced bankruptcy counsel.\n\nOften the stress of dealing creditors, especially as a result of fraud, is as important or more so, than the debt itself.\nWith all the collection activity in your inquiry, it would be surprising if your mother would not want to simplify her life, by considering bankruptcy.\n\nIt is her choice, even though her social security funds and the pension income appear to be exempt property and should not be seized by creditors, without filing bankruptcy.\nThe exemption for this property has to be asserted, to release funds that are levied or seized, which is an unnecessary exercise, if there is a bankruptcy.\n\nThere is a potential issue because it appears your mother moved from New Jersey to California only a year ago.\nHowever, with the property described in your inquiry, she appears eligible to exempt what she has."

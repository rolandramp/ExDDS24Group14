        "You have posted this question in the Bankruptcy section ... so does your friend have other debt as well. BK is not worth it for $5,000 only; unfortunately, without a signed promissory note, your friend is out-of-luck.",
        "Not sure why you have posted this question under the practice area of Bankruptcy, but nevertheless your question is not very clear. If you are asking what recourse your friend may have against his stepson for the debt, I would say \"none.\" You state the card was intentionally given to the stepson to use. The stepson used the card and incurred debt. If there was some sort of agreement that the stepson would pay any charges incurred, then that would be a civil matter if your friend wanted to bring a small claims action against the stepson for breach of that agreement. But, unless such agreement was in writing, all you are left with is a card that was voluntarily and intentionally given to someone to use and they used it. I don't see any issue that would be addressed in bankruptcy, i.e. if the stepson were to file BK and try to discharge this obligation, unless your friend would be able to prove that the stepson somehow defrauded him by promising to pay the incurred charges as a condition of being given the card to use, but that was a false promise and he really had no intention of paying. That would be a stretch but would be the only argument possible I would think. The fact that the stepson made some payments and then stopped makes that argument even more difficult to prove. Bottom line - this appears to be just another life lesson - never give your credit card to anyone to use.",
        "This is a good reason not to lend your credit to anyone. Unfortunately your friend is legally responsible for the debt becuase it is in his name. He could try to claim identiy theft but as he voluntarily did it that would not work.",
        "Sadly, if your friend approved the use of his credit card, your friend is responsible for payment of the credit card debt. It may be possible to sue the stepson in small claims court to recover the $5,000, but only if the stepson agreed to repay his stepfather for any charges that he made. Of course, suing a family member is an extreme measure, usually not worth the stress and alienation that it causes. He should try to re-establish contact with his stepson and persuade him to make whatever payments he can."

        "Well, that's a good thing for the creditor. If the debtor pays the debt in the plan, isn't that what the creditor wants? The adversary proceeding wouldn't ordinarily disappear, but there might possibly be no need for it.",
        "If you timely filed a complaint in the Ch 7 claiming that your debt is an excecption to the Ch 7 discharge, then the complaint is still applicable to the Ch 13 case, assuming you continue to prosecute the case. If your complaint was an objection to the Ch 7 discharge [a 727 complaint], then conversion to Ch 13 may make your complaint moot. BUT . . . you may have grounds to move to dismiss the Ch 13 case based upon bad faith. It this case is in the So Dist of California, consider contacted me for a detailed review of your case.",
        "It depends. Some debts that are not dischargeable in a chapter 7 case may be dischargeable in a chapter 13. Other debts can be determined to be non-dischargeable in either a 7 or a 13. It may be necessary to continue the litigation even after the conversion of the case. The Adversary Complaint is a separate but related proceeding that has its own calendar and requirements. That matter will remain open until it is either dismissed or resolved either by settlement or a ruling from the judge.",
        "The answer is \"it depends.\" If the action was to find a debt non-dischargeable, the adversary will likely continue in order for a determination of the issue presented. The Judge will let you know if the matter is moot, and will not proceed.\n\nI hope this helps.\nRespectfully,\nSteven A. Leahy\nwww.chicagotaxteam.com"

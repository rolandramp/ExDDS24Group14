        "By \"time barred debt\" I assume you mean you believe the Statute of Limitations period has passed within which the creditor can file a civil lawsuit against you to collect the debt. According to California Code of Civil Procedure ยง 337(1), the statute of limitations for a written contract is four years. This means that after four years has passed since that last time you made any transactions using that account, the creditor can not successfully sue you in a California Court (assuming you appear in a civil suit to assert your rights). Be sure to calculate the statutory period correctly as it begins to run from the moment the borrower defaults on their payment, and may be extended or \"refreshed\" if you have made any transactions or payments toward that account (eg. \"debt settlement\" payments).\n1) No, assuming you have correctly calculated the statute of limitations and the creditor has not filed a civil lawsuit against you before the statutory time period has lapsed;\n2) No, but you can extend, renew or \"refresh\" the statutory period by your own actions relating to account;\n3) Possibly, if the credit card company has issued you a 1099c before you are able to discharge the debt.\nSamson & Associates has an office near you.

No. Not unless you've done something to toll the statute - extend the statute - if you really haven't paid, haven't promised to pay, etc. and the debt is barred ... once barred, that's it.\n3.

        "You do not need to sign anything to have been served. If you received a Request to Enter Default and/or Request to Enter Clerk's Judgment, you need to immediately move to set aside your default and any resulting judgment. Hopefully, there is enough time. Generally, the outside limit is 6 months from entry of default. If your default is set aside, i.e., if you file the motion and it is granted, you will then be given an opportunity to defend the lawsuit. Good luck. -- Michael"

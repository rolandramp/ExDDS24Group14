    "question": "If any unforeseen debts (from third parties, credit cards or what not) or debt collections from the IRS come due after the probate has been closed who are the responsible parties assuming only two beneficiaries who split estate 50/50 and one was executor? What is the Executor vs regular beneficiary liability on those debts? And is there any limitations on how long after they can put in a claim?",

        "Generally speaking, a creditor if an estate has four months within which to file a claim against the estate. Beyond this, there is a strict one year statute of limitations regarding a creditor's ability to bring claim against a decedent's estate for claims that arose before the death of the decedent. The IRS is an exception to these rules. If an executor distributed assets of the estate without paying a creditor, the executor may held personally liable. What's more, anyone who inherits from a decedent is liable up to the amount inherited for unpaid debts of the decedent (subject to the rules governing the ability of a creditor to enforce a claim).",

    "title": "Chapter 7 In CA 704 or 703 exemptions, do married couples get to double the car exemption. We have 2 cars, so does in 704=probl",
    "question": "Basically, if I can only take the 2200 car allowance, and if I had 2 cars worth that, does that automatically mean 1 car will be lost? If they can't be doubled, seems like it doesn't make sense. A married couple can exempt the same amount of car that a single person could?",
    "answers": [
        "You cannot double up. There is however a wildcard exemption under 703, which if this is the appropriate and best set (you have to choose between 703 or 704, can't mix these up) could possibly cover the second vehicle. I hope you will be hiring a bankruptcy attorney to handle your case. Too many things can go wrong in the DIY job.",
        "The exemption under:\n\n704 - allows equity in any number of vehicles.\n\n703 - allows equity in one vehicle.\n\nIf equity exceeds you exemption amount then the Ch. 7 Trustee may liquidate the vehicle to pay creditors. However, the decision is going to depend upon how much equity there is for the creditors after the Trustee's fees and costs.\n\nYou should really have attorney representation instead of trying to do this on your own.\n\nBW 877-497-0628",
        "The law is clear. Fair or unfair -- married couples who file a joint petition share the exemption.",

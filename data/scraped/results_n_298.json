        "The 341a (Meeting of Creitors) is conducted by the Trustee charged with administering your case. It appears you do not have a BK lawyer assisting you. You should call the Trustee in your case and ask if further information or documents are needed. If so, you will be told what is needed. If nothing is needed, most likely the trustee has not yet fully reviewed your case and more time is needed to complete the trustee's review.",

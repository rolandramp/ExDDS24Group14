        "I assume you have a writ of execution already outstanding. If so, this is one of those things set forth in the Code of Civil Procedure, but most courts are not set up to handle it this way. I tried using that Ventura County form in Santa Clara County, and I got nowhere fast. You might try giving a conformed copy of the filed memorandum to the sheriff along with a copy of the court's docket showing no motion was filed.\n\nIf you want to get a new writ issued then you will file a new memorandum of costs showing the costs that have been added, payments made, and interest.\n\nGood luck."

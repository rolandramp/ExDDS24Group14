    "question": "I get paid twice a month. The 10th and 22nd of every month. Here is an example. If the attorney is asking for August paycheck stubs, which one do I give him: July 15-30 paid on August 10. August 1-15 paid on the 22nd or August 15-31 paid on September 10.",

        "When I request pay stubs for the last 6 months, I want stubs for checks dated within the last 6 months. For instance, if your stub is for February 15 - 28th but you were paid on the March 5th, I would want that stub. For me, it is by date the money was paid rather than the the period in which it was earned.",
        "In order to complete the \"means test\", the attorney must see all paystubs from all employers in order to determine whether the client passes or not. The month in which you file your bankruptcy is not included in that calculation, but the current paystubs are still needed to obtain a year-to-date income figure.",
        "Calculates the Means Test, presumption of abuse issues, to see if you qualify to stay in the Ch 7, or whether the trustee will move to move you into a Chapter 13. Don't lie. If they catch you, you will really be in trouble.",
        "It usually means all pay stubs received within the last six full months. So, all pay stubs you received from March 1 2012 through Aug. 31 2012. And my guess is that your attorney will want all your new ones as well up until the day your case is filed with the court, although he or she will let you know exactly what they need.",
        "The law reviews income for the 6 complete months prior to filing. The check received on September 10th will show year to date income through August 31st - so that's needed. As a practical matter, provide them all.",
        "Hello,\n\nYour attorney is likely asking for all paystubs you received in the past six months, not just select paystubs. The reason your attorney is asking for these paystubs is so that he/she can properly calculate your total income received in the past six months, as required by the bankruptcy means test. Given it is now September, your attorney likely needs any paystubs for all sources of income you received from March 1, 2012 to August 31, 2012.\n\nHopefully this info helps explain things. If you have any further questions feel free to post them or contact my office directly at www.NewChapterLaw.com. Best of luck!",
        "My sense is that he'd want the pay stubs for money paid in the month of August, but you should ask your own attorney instead of asking here..",
        "You are overthinking it. You could simply ask him what he wants, or you could just simply give him all pay stubs since March 1 if he plans on filing soon."

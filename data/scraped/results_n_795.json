    "title": "Can you stop working for a number of months in order to pass the income and/or means test in order to file Chapter 7?",
    "question": "I have large debt pre-recent marriage, but I do not qualify for Chapter 7 based on income or the means test (because I have to count my wife's income). We were told that I could stop working for 6 months and then file for Chapter 7 (since at that time I would pass both income and means tests).",

    "answers": [
        "Assuming no exemption from the means test, please don't assume you don't qualify if income and expenses weren't analyzed in detail by counsel. For the consumer debtor, qualifying for chapter 7 is a function of both past income (incorporated into the means test) as well as projected income, which serves to check the means test for temporarily reduced income. Persons may discontinue or reduce employment or overtime for a variety of legitimate reasons such as health concerns, well being and care for family. Passing the means test in and of itself is not a valid reason to withdraw from work one intends to otherwise maintain.",
        "First, I agree with the above responses to the extent that they advise that you operate with caution in a strategy like this and second, that you must have experienced bankruptcy counsel represent you.\n\nThere is no law that requires you to work. If you opt to quit work, that is your decision. If the decline in income allows you to pass the means test, then you pass it. However, if you are planning to quit temporarily and go back to work after the bankruptcy and your employer is holding your job, you may have an issue. You are required to report any anticipated change in income of more than 10%.\n\nBankruptcy is not just about filling out forms or passing a single test. It's a complicated area of law with hundreds of statutes and case law. There are serious ramifications if the case is not handled properly. Strategy is a key reason for hiring competent legal counsel in any legal matter. You want the best outcome and the best advice.",
        "Possibly. Means Test considers last 6 months income.\nHowever, be advised of possible move to dismiss by trustee or court.\nReview all facts with experiences C7 BK counsel.",

        "Seems like you should get a 2nd opinion.\nBest of luck.\n\nAdam Arnold",
        "There is a very detailed income analysis that is to be conducted. Yes it can be managed to maximize your situation. You need to have a very competent local San Diego Bankruptcy Attorney review your situation very carefully and advise you appropriately.",
        "\"We were told that I could stop working . . . \" Probably not by any responsible experienced bankruptcy attorney. The reason is that income and the \"means test\" is not the end of the analysis.

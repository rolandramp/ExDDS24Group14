        "Technically speaking, yes you can. However, practically speaking, you should be aware that this deficiency is typically very easy to correct and could be corrected at any time and on very short notice or no notice to you at all. In other words, it is quite likely that the Debtor can and will correct the problem and be granted a discharge order soon. Should the Debtor be granted a discharge, the court would mail out a notice so indicating to all creditors listed on the creditor matrix. In the meant time, you would be wise to tread carefully.",
        "From what you are describing, it sounds like the debtor or the attorney failed to file the Certificate of Debtor Education. It is a mandatory class that the debtor must take in order to receive a discharge.\n\nif the case was closed without a discharge, you should be able to proceed to collect as if the bankruptcy had not been filed. However, it is also quite easy for the debtor or attorney to get the case reopened to file the required certificate and receive the discharge, You might not want to invest to much in legal fees by trying to collect on this debt just yet.",
        "The closing of a Chapter 7 without a discharge usually dissolves the automatic stay. This means that you can proceed to collect your judgment. However, if the reason for the case being closed is based on a minor failure by the debtor, that failure can be corrected and the discharge eventually granted. It would be a waste of your time and money to proceed if the debtor can correct the deficiency and get a discharge. You or your lawyer may be able to access PACER to discover the reason why the case was closed. Good luck."

    "title": "How to haggle with debt collectors?!",
    "question": "I owe $4800 in traffic fines, all from 07-09 when i was 17-19! Now that i'm 24 i have to deal with my childish mistakes.. (driving with no insurance/reg). So I have a credit card that I have done great with, pay on-time, it has boosted my credit, i manage it very well. I have $1900 available credit, and want to put these old tickets to rest once and for all! They are with Alliance one, and i'm i CA. What is the best strategy to get these debt collectors to take $1900 for all the tickets owed? Does this sound likely? Whats my best angle?",

        "Call them, offer them $1000, and tell them that's all that you budget permits you to pay right now. See what they respond. If they give you a counteroffer, then you know that there is at least some flexibility and you can try to submit a new offer. My hunch is that delinquent traffic fines are generally not negotiable, but it still can't hurt to ask. Maybe they'll at least be willing to work out a payment plan with you.",
        "I have found a legal guide written by my esteemed colleague in Ohio to be very helpful and am posting a link to his article below. It doesn't matter whether the debt is for credit cards or something else, debt collectors do not want payments, they want a lump sum of cash & will discount substantially for cash, if you have a good story and your timing is right. I think these strategies can work better by phone conversation than by mail, but maybe that is just me. Hope this perspective helps!",
        "The best way to do this I have found is to write them a letter requesting a payment plan which can allow for satisfaction of the debt for less than the full value owed. In this letter, you want to outline the difficulties that paying this will create, who you support with your income, and generally why you are deserving of a break.\n\nIn addition, you will want to be forthright in setting up a payment plan. Usually these kinds of things involve a lump sum with payments over a period of months. Since you have less money to work with as it is being paid on credit, it may be good to start the down payment at less than $1500 perhaps around $1200 (25%) followed by monthly payments of a few hundred or so for a period of months.\n\nIn your letter, you will want to include a request that they consider your offer and contact you about whether it can be arranged. If you don't hear back from them in a week, try calling and attempting to discuss it. The goal ultimately is to get a dialogue going regarding how much they can budge. Getting this phone number can be a real pain but you will have to do a lot of googling. Make sure to verify that they own the debt and confirm this with the seller of the debt as some agencies have been known to unscrupulously claim ownership of debts they don't hold.\n\nDebt collectors often buy debt for pennies on the dollar so they are more flexible with payment than the original creditor. Because of this, they are more willing to wiggle on terms because they are happy to collect any money.\n\nLastly, at the end of payment, be sure to receive documentation acknowledging satisfaction of the debt obligation so that you have proof that it has been paid.\n\nHope that helps!"

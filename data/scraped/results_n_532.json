    "title": "In chapter 7 bankruptcy in California. Which exemptions available to protect my workers comp annuity. I am 55% disabled paid/mo",
    "question": "So the doctor put me at 55% disabled and I won a decent size award in workers compensation case. I was told that the bulk of the money had to be put into an annuity, so that's where it went. I receive a little over $1000 per month to live off of. But, there is actually a pot of money (around $115k) in the annuity. My question is (especially since I need this to live).",

        "You should consider that correctly protecting $115,000 in future benefits will be well worth the $1,000 to $2,000 you will pay an attorney to take care of this for you. Even a correct exemption claim can run into disputes with a trustee.",
        "You should be able to exempt it under 703.140(b)(10) - ERISA-qualified pension, annuities, and benefits necessary for support, however, I highly recommend speaking with a professional who can analyze the type of annuity you have and confirm that it can be exempted BEFORE you file for chapter 7. You do not want to file and risk losing your annuity to your creditors.",
        "It depends. Nolo says: \"Many annuities are exempt (protected) from the reach of creditors under either federal bankruptcy law or state law, but some are not. The ability to use the exemption can turn on the particular characteristics of the annuity, making this area of law complicated. If you have an annuity and you’re thinking about filing a bankruptcy case, it’s important that you seek out professional advice because a mistake can be costly.\""

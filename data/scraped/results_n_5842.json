        "If you feel the car is worth $1500, then that is the amount that should be offered for a redemption. The key is being able to convince the creditor of the true market value of the vehicle and then offer that amount. If they really believe that if they were to repossess the vehicle and sell it that they would not be able to get more than that amount, then they might agree to the redemption. So, if you feel it is worth $1500, and they also feel it is worth $1500, then they probably wouldn't see any reason to accept $1000, but it's always worth a try.\n\nAs far as the \"true\" car value, the only true value is whatever someone is willing to pay for it. Aside from that, the BK court and creditors usually will accept Kelley Blue Book (www.kbb.com) and NADA Guides (www.nadaguides.com) valuations. When looking up the value on either of those sources, be sure to use the wholesale \"Trade-In\" value, not the private-party value. If those sources show a higher value than you think is really accurate, since they might not accurately take into consideration prior accident damage, etc., then you can always show the creditor the printout of the value and then include a written statement and any documenation you have showing the prior damage and the true condition of the vehicle (mileage is already taken into consideration on those websites). If there remains a wide gap between your estimate of the value and the creditor's estimate, you can also suggest having the creditor send someone out (or you take it to them) to actually look at the condition of the vehicle to verify what you are telling them. As stated above, if after all that, the creditor is convinced they won't be able to net a higher price by repossessing and selling the vehicle, then they might agree to the redemption. If not, then you would be left with surrending the vehicle and discharging the debt, or negotiating a reaffirmation agreement that might at least reduce the balance to be paid to something a little closer to what you feel the true value is."

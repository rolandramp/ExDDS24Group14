    "title": "I won a federal judgment - how do I collect on it?",
    "question": "I won a federal judgment from a bankruptcy court. The amount was for $2500. How do I collect on this? Can I use the State Court to get the money or do I have to use the Federal Courts? What forms do I need and what do I need to attach to them if anything? Do you have any advice as to what I should do (or how much it cost to have an attorney do this)?",

        "Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 69(a)\n(1) Money Judgment; Applicable Procedure. A money judgment is enforced by a writ of execution, unless the court directs otherwise. The procedure on execution—and in proceedings supplementary to and in aid of judgment or execution—must accord with the procedure of the state where the court is located, but a federal statute governs to the extent it applies.\n\nWhile you are entitled to begin collecting on a federal judgment as soon as it is entered by the court, it may be a good idea to wait until the appeals period has ended - 30 days.",
        "This will depend on How collectable this judgment is. You may find an attorney to take it on contingency, but I agree with above lawyer that doing it hourly would be cost prohibitive. I would use Avvo to do a search for judgment collection attorneys and run your scenario by a few of them. You may just find one to do your case on contingency which means if they can't collect anything you don't owe them anything. Good luck!",
        "It is unlikely that you can hire a lawyer in a cost-effective way given the size of the judgment. You may want to speak with the clerk's office; they may have a pamphlet or brochure giving information about how to collect the judgment."

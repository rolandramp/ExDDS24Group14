        "You stated that your attorney is \"threatening\" to withdraw from your case. Your state court attorney may be reacting to something other than your filing of the Chapter 7. I cannot tell from your question if your filing for Bankruptcy protection came as a surprise to your civil action attorney. Sometimes, a civil attorney will recommend Bankruptcy if he feels the overall case has little to no merit. The counter-suit may have been an attempt to bring the other party to the bargaining table, and it may have failed in its goal. If so, he may realize that there will be nothing else that he can do for you, because the civil action must be \"stayed\" once the Bankruptcy is filed. You cannot proceed with your counter-claim because the rest of the case is stayed, and the opposing counsel MUST dismiss his client's matter without prejudice, and must totally abandon the suit if the debt to his client is discharged. He may also be unfamiliar with Bankruptcy, which is very common amongst non-Bankruptcy attorneys. It is difficult to go from 65 miles per hour to 0 miles per hour. That is what has happened in your lawsuit. There are other variables, but I would not necessarily read \"evil\" into your attorney's intentions. There is simply nothing for him to do right now except wait to see if your bankruptcy case is successful, vis-a-vis that creditor. If the Chapter 7 Trustee finds merit in your counter-suit, the Trustee can fire your attorney in favor of their own. That is a tremendous disincentive to continue. Your attorney can speak with the Trustee, and make an argument why he/she is the best to to complete the counter-suit, and many trustees will stay with the existing attorney just because they know the facts of the case and the many other nuances of the case. That decision resides entirely in the Bankruptcy Chapter 7 Trustee's discretion. many civil attorney's have been burned by a client filing Bankruptcy, which is what your attorney may have experienced in the past. It is best to believe the best in people, and simply talk to him/her about their concerns. I recommend that in this case. God Bless You!",
        "The withdrawal of your attorney in a state court case after you filed bankruptcy would not be a violation of the Automatic Stay. They may withdraw under the standards of California Rules of Professional Conduct Rule 3-700. One of the provisions allowing the attorney to withdraw with permission of the court is if he/she is not getting paid. If you are discharging a debt owed to that attorney, that might be enough for the court to allow withdrawal.\n\nThis is a question that you could readily ask your bankruptcy attorney. Hopefully you are not trying to do this without an attorney!",
        "The automatic stay does not require that anyone continue providing services to you - simple as that.",
        "I agree with Attorney Zimmerman's cogent analysis. Withdrawing form the case is not in and of itself a violation of he automatic stay as the attorney is not a creditor attempting to collect a debt from you. As a practical matter, nothing is going to happen in the case until your bankruptcy is concluded.",
        "I would need to know your attorney's grounds for threatening to withdraw but I would guess he is worried about two things. 1 - Do you owe him money for his representation? If so, his debt will most likely get discharged in the bankruptcy and he doesn't want to continue representing you. 2 - The cross-complaint is an asset of the bankruptcy estate and the trustee and can take it over. If that happens, the Trustee can either use your current attorney or bring in their own attorney. He shouldn't withdraw for that reason until he knows what the trustee is doing. Depending on what the initial complaint and cross-complaint are about, the initial complaint might also get discharged in the bankruptcy and the cross-complaint may not have grounds to survive with out it. Again, all of this depend on what the complaint and cross-complaint are about."

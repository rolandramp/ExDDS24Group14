        "You should probably not being reaffirming debt on a mortgage. The creditor is usually the one that prepares and sends you the reaffirmation agreement. Reaffirmation agreements are usually done with car loans not real property loans. The Statement of Intention is what is \"intended\" and it does not necessarily lock the debtor into doing anything. It is a plan of what the debtor intends to do so the creditor is aware. Without the debtor entering into a reaffirmation agreement the debtor's personally liability is discharged. You should be aware of the consequences of reaffirming debt. I recommend you speak with a bankruptcy attorney.",
        "The Statement of Intention lets the creditors know what your intentions are. I do not suggest signing a reaffirmation agreement on real property, in fact one of the answer choices on the statement of intention form is that you will keep the property and pay pursuant to contract. This is the answer my clients use when it comes to real property. When you reaffirm a debt you loose the ability to discharge the debt because it becomes a post petition debt.\nThe reason that it is usually not wise to reaffirm a real property debt is in case something happens after your discharge and you are unable to keep the property, the secured debt will be considered a pre-petition debt and your discharge will apply to the debt so the lender will not come after you for the difference between what the property sells at foreclosure and the amount of the loan (a deficiency). For a secured debt that was used to purchase or improve the property the California 1 Action Rule prevents the secured creditor from claiming a deficiency after foreclosing, however, if the secured debt was used to pay off credit cards or something else, these lenders will claim a deficiency and then you will have lost the property and face a deficiency judgment.\nThe only debt that you should reaffirm, if you are keeping the property, is an automobile loan. Here's why, the automobile industry paid their lobbyists and the lawmakers agreed to carve out an exception to the Bankruptcy Code that requires a person to enter into a reaffirmation agreement if they intend to keep their vehicle. If the agreement is not entered on the court docket before discharge then the lender has the right to repossess the vehicle after discharge, even if the vehicle is properly insured and all payments on the loan are current. The only exception is if the Court will not approve the reaffirmation agreement, then as long as the payments are current and the vehicle is properly insured the lender is stopped from repossession.",

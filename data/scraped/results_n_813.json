    "title": "CALFRESH/Welfare Overpayment , Chapter 7 Discharge",
    "question": "I'm on the verge of filing Chapter 7 Bankruptcy for about 20,000 dollars of unsecured debt. Most of this is medical debt. In the past five years, I have intermittently been on CALFRESH (food stamps) and Cash Aid. When I think about it, I might have, at some point, received overpayments due to possibly not reporting changes in employment in a timely manner. I'm not being pursued for an overpayment at this time, and I'm not sure if it actually has happened. But once in a while, it hits me that I might have inadvertently received an overpayment and I am very concerned about the consequences. I never made false statements to get a welfare overpayment, and never intended to defraud the system. I can think of one instance when I returned to work and failed to notify welfare in a timely manner, and received a couple of months of overpayment. I thought I notified Welfare, but I had only notified the child support office (they're in the same building, next to each other, and I thought it was taken care of...) Anyways, assuming that the welfare office can't prove I had fraudulent intent and made willful false statements, can a Calfresh/Cash Aid overpayment be discharged in Chapter 7?",

        "Many people erroneously assume that all debts to the government will survive a bankruptcy. This type of debt is dischargeable unless the creditor challenges the discharge on the basis you engaged in fraud or willful misconduct. That said, I have routinely had social security overpayments and unemployment overpayments discharged. Similarly, I have had Fastrak fines discharged. It seems the various governmental agencies do not bother to challenge the discharge of these claims. Bottom line: be sure to list the creditor and I think it should go fine.",
        "My colleagues Caldwell and Bunce have provided excellent responses based on the facts you presented. The intentions of a tax creditor cannot be divined here. But there is no doubt you need to disclose this concern to your BK lawyer who can help you navigate this potential legal minefield.",
        "I agree with Ms. Bunce. I suspect that CalFresh and the state of California will object your your discharging the overpayments you received and they will assert fraudulent intent on your part, especially since you say this happened on a number of occasions over the last few years. A one time oversight is one thing. Several occasions over several years is a pattern of behavior. Make sure you advise your attorney about this issue ahead of time.",
        "Guessing what a creditor might do in a bankruptcy case is not the kind of advice that is appropriate in an online forum. If otherwise qualified, you can file chapter 7, but the creditor could file an adversary proceeding to ask that you be denied a discharge. Who might come out on top would depend on evidence you are unlikely to know of. Hope this perspective helps!"

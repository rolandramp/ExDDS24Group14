        "There should not be an issue with a U.S. citizen getting married to his flight attendant girlfriend during her short stop in the United States, especiallly since she intends to return to her home country following the marriage. A problem would arise if the girlfriend/spouse sought to adjust her status in the United States to permanent resident.\n\nOnce the girlfriend/spouse returns to her home country, the U.S. citizen can file a petition sponsoring her for permanent resident (\"green card\"/immigrant) status.",
        "Usually flight attendants enter on a C visa (crew visa). Such visas cannot be changed and does not allow change of status. If you get married to her you will need to file a K visa or a straight greencard while she is abroad.

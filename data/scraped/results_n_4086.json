    "title": "After a writ of execution has expired, can a creditor get it re-issued or do they just file a new one? Can it be done online?",
    "question": "This is a California Civil case in which a writ of execution money judgment was entered and has since expired, though the judgment itself is still in effect. I had filed with the County sheriff to garnish wages, but the writ expired before they received a response from the debtors' employers. One of the debtors is no longer with his previous employer and we do not know how to proceed with that either, but that is another topic I suppose. Your time is valuable and I appreciate your help; even a simple link to a clear layman's English set of instructions and/or explanations of the law and process as it would be approached by someone without legal expertise would be fantastic. Thank you! - Nathan",

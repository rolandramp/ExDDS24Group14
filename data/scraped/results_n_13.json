        "The fast answer to your question is NO, CA law does not allow that a vehicle can be repossessed immediately after a Ch. 13 is filed. BK Ch. 13 is federal law, not state. Your question raises questions, though. Was the case really a Ch. 13 or did you file a Ch. 7? It is easy for those that are new to BK to mix up the two. There is a way, under Ch. 7, if certain filings are not met, where the creditor can legitimately repossess the vehicle after filing. Assuming a 13 was actually filed, and then the vehicle repossessed, then that action should be protected by federal law, not state law. Likely the repossession can be undone, but we don't have enough facts here to say, one way or the other. Notice to the creditor of the actual filing would be key, as has been pointed out by prior answers. You need to speak with your attorney about this turn of events. JCC",

    "title": "CA Probate if there is no enough money in the Estate is the Administrator of the Estate personally liable for the attorney fee?",
    "question": "The Estate does not have enough funds to cover the Probate Attorney Fee--- As an Administrator of the Estate should I pay the fee out of my pocket?",
    "answers": [
        "You are not obligated to pay the fees personally. It is odd that an insolvent estate would go through probate but it happens.",
        "More information is needed. Are you saying that there is no cash on hand? Is there real property? Or personal property e.g. automobiles, paintings etc... If the estate is completely insolvent, then no, you are not required to pay attorneys fees, however I think more information should be explained, starting with what the entire estate's makeup is.",
        "You do not have to do this out of your own pocket but you are allowed to do this if that is what you choose to do.",
        "If there are no assets of the estate from which to pay the statutory attorney or executor fees, than no such fees need be paid. However, if an estate is being probated than there would likely exist some asset from which to satisfy, or partially pay the statutory attorney's fees, unless of course the debts of the estate exceed the value of the estate; in which case i would wonder why anything would be probated in the first place. Perhaps if we had a few more facts we might be able to provide a more precise answer for you."

    "title": "My husband is a co-sponsor for his sister in law. What are cases that he might be financially responsible (ie govt benefits)",
    "question": "My husband's brother is in school and has no income, so he can't be the sole sponsor of his baby mama. My husband agreed to be a co sponsor so that she can stay in US with the baby. My husband's sister in law is low income, therefore she has been taking advantage of government benefits as soon as she came to US and gave birth. I read that government can sue the sponsors for the benefits she's taking. What are the examples of benefits she is allowed to take without us being sued?",

    "title": "Is it necessary to file for probate in CA when the total of property and estate is approximately $100,000?",
    "question": "My father passed away recently and I am listed as the executor of his will, but I have no experience in this and am not sure if his will needs to be filed in the local probate court in California. Also, I would like to know what is considered as property of the estate. He had no land, home, automobile or investments. Also, he had no debts. The only property he had is approximately $100,000 in a savings account, approximately $8,000 in a joint checking account with myself, some 35 year-old used furniture (bedroom set and a table with chairs), an approximately 5 year-old lifting recliner, a couple old used televisions, and a motorized scooter. Am I allowed to give away the furniture or must I try to sell it and put the money received into an estate fund to be divided?",

        "Probate estates valued at $150K or less can be administered by a small estate affidavit that you will have to take to the bank that holds the savings account. As joint tenant on the checking account, nothing further need be done. However, if you were on the account only as a matter of convenience, then legally the money is his and should become part of the estate. As for personal property -- if there are other beneficiaries of the estate you should talk to them first before giving anything away. Many executors donate unwanted used clothing, furniture etc.. the only thing that might have value from what you list is the motorized scooter."

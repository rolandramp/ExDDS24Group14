    "question": "I had the judgment taken from their bank account after 60 days. This was small claims. I filed a EJ-001 Abstract of Judgment -Civil and Small Claims with the county recorders to put a lien on them. Now that they have paid, I want to take it off.",
    "answers": [
        "You need to file a satisfaction of judgment with the court and have it certified then record it. You may need a cover sheet for the recorder. The recorder should be able to tell you if a cover sheet is necessary. Worst case, google release of lien or ask a title company for the form. It is not technically proper, but at least you will not be encumbering the property anymore."

    "question": "In July 2016, an attorney filed a petition for chapter 13 bankruptcy for my husband and I but we never did anything with it after that so debt never went away and it shows the bankruptcy as being open on my credit report. I don't understand why it is on there when we never actually went through with he process...",

        "I agree with my colleagues. That fact that a Chapter 13 bankruptcy was filed is a true fact that the credit reporting agencies have discovered and are reporting correctly. It has been my experience that a credit report simply shows that a bankruptcy was filed and does not include information on the status of the case. It will remain on your credit report for about 10 years.",
        "Your efforts to \"remove\" an accurate entry in your credit report are in vain. As stated by my colleagues your credit report is accurate as to any reference to your BK 13 filing. But all is not lost. You have the right to make a 100 word \"consumer statement\" (CS) which will be included in your credit report. Any time you apply for credit, the inquiring party will see your CS. That process allows you to give \"your side of the story\" and explain what happened. Your CS should be directed to all three credit reporting agencies, (CRA) Equifax, Experian and TransUnion. If you visit their websites you will find out how to specifically proceed. While you're at it, you can dispute any specific item and demand it be investigated and verified. If the CRA cannot verify the item because the creditor does not respond, that item will be removed. Obviously, you only want to dispute negative items such as \"slow pay\" or \"no pay\". You don't have to explain why you are disputing. If, after the CRA investigates, and finds that the item is correct, you can still make another CS as to that item. Good luck and God bless.",
        "If you opened in a case in bankruptcy court (case number, date of filing, judge assigned) that is enough to show as a public record that you did in fact file bankruptcy. Whether it was a successful case or not is immaterial. Now, if there is something inaccurate, you can dispute that with a credit reporting bureau. But, if it simply shows the information about the case you filed, that would be accurate.",
        "The reporting of a bankruptcy for purposes of the credit report is as of the date of the filing. This filing establishes the fact that a voluntary (usually) petition was filed, a case number was assigned, and the BK process was begun. All this is public record, is apparently correct in your circumstances, and does not change when the case is not followed through with = case is dismissed. The credit reporting agencies are apparently reporting a correct fact, a case was filed. That isn't undone by the subsequent dismissal of the case. JCC"

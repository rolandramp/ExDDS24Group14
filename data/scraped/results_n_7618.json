    "title": "Collection Status: Creditor Cannot Locate Individual. Unknown To Me Until Viewed in Credit Report",
    "question": "Car was towed earlier this year; 30 day impound. Total to retrieve vehicle was virtually the same as car's value so I abandoned it to the tow yard. No notice sent to me that they were going through the motions to take over registration with option to come pick up car. Surprising, but fine since I had no intention of retrieving car anyway.",

        "The only puzzling part in your recital of facts is the increase of the original amount from $505 to $512.\n\nSounds too expensive to fight. I suggest pay/settle.",
        "At some point someone should contact you and they may even sue you, but doubtful for such a low amount. If you can locate them and get the inormation removed from the credit report by paying the deficiancy then that would clean up the record but make sure you get the settlement in writing.",
        "I agree with attorney Goldstein on the potential source of the debt. Unless you notified the storage yard of your address the only source of locating you would be through the state motor vehicle department or documentation in the vehicle such as your vehicle registration. If the address on either of those sources was not current that might explain the lack of actual notification. I suggest trying to settle the debt is your best course of action.",
        "The tow yard most likely had a lien for at least some portion of what it was owed as long as it held the car. Once it sold the car, if the amount the tow yard received was less than what it was owed, it has the right to come after you for the difference. You can fight it and make them prove that the sold the vehicle in a commercially reasonable manner. You can fight arguing that the debt collectors have no right to come after you.\n\nOR, you can offer a settlement with the tow yard - you agree to pay a specific amount and they agree to remove the negative report."

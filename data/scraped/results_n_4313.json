    "title": "What questions do not need to be answered in a debtor's exam? Do I need to provide auto insurance, ID, CPA , or spouse info?",
    "question": "I am preparing for the debtor's exam. The creditor asks me to bring the auto insurance. There are 2 policies that cover me but both cars are owned by my company/employer. Do I need to bring them? Can they see my driver's license? They also ask me who my CPA is and my spouse's financial information. Do I need to provide everything they need? What are the questions or requests they are not allowed to ask in general? How do I object to certain questions? On what grounds?",
    "answers": [
        "In a debtor's exam, the creditor can ask for almost any information that is reasonably likely to lead to the discovery of assets that can be used to satisfy the judgment. If there is a dispute as to whether a question is proper, you can go back into the courtroom and ask the judge. The only objections that I've seen upheld were to the production of tax returns, or in a specific case where the debtor was the target in a criminal investigation related to his financial affairs.",
        "Most of the time, the court will only uphold a privacy objection in a debtor's exam. And not an invasion of YOUR privacy, but rather, invasion of privacy of third persons, i.e., a client list, etc.",

    "title": "I received a discharged a year before a judgment was issued in a pending suit included in my BK schedules. Do I owe the money?",
    "question": "I filed BK in 2012 and listed a pending lawsuit as a debt in my schedules. I received a discharge in 2013 but the judgment from the lawsuit didn't get finalized until almost a year after the discharge. Would this judgment have been discharged or am I liable to pay the judgment?",

        "I agree with my colleague. Since the lawsuit began before your discharge, the debt was discharged. As my colleague points out the judgment should be vacated. See if the creditor will enter into a stipulation and order vacating the judgment, otherwise you may need to file a motion to vacate the judgment with the Court.",
        "With all due respect to the other answers given by my esteemed colleagues on here, there is insufficient information to answer your question.\n\nThe following key questions must first be answered:\nWhich bankruptcy chapter did you receive your discharge under?\nIf Chapter 7, were there assets administered by the Trustee?\nIf yes to the above or the case was filed under Chapter 13, was this judgment creditor properly listed in the bankruptcy papers and receive notice of the bankruptcy filing?\n\nIf you filed a Chapter 7 case and no assets were administered, then I agree with the other answers that the debt was discharged with the following caveat: If this creditor was not properly listed and did not receive notice of the bankruptcy case, and if there is a fraud allegation to be made in connection with the claim (or it is of another type of debt excepted from discharge in bankruptcy), then they could still seek to reopen the case to litigate the dischargeability of their debt. But in the meantime, the judgment that was entered violates the post-discharge injunction of 11 USC 524.\n\nIf this was a Chapter 13 case, or an asset Chapter 7 case, then the answer is: It depends on whether the creditor was properly listed and received timely notice of the bankruptcy filing.",
        "Adding to what others above have stated, if opposing counsel was aware of the bankruptcy petition, the pending litigation in state court should have been stayed.\nYou also could (and probably should) have notified the court.\n\nDid the other party request or receive relief from the stay from the Bankruptcy Court?\n\nIn either event, the amount of the money judgment is discharged. The judgment itself should be vacated as void.\n\nBut it's important that you have an attorney go to the Bankruptcy Court to get orders on this. Some creditors will take the position that the debt is not affected by the bankruptcy petition, and the last thing anyone in this situation should do is argue it in state court, because later a Bankruptcy Judge might conclude that you consented to the state court ruling on it.",
        "The debt should have been discharged unless the court excepted the creditor from your discharge. Did you notify the court of your BK? Any action taken on the debt without an order vacating the automatic stay would be a violation of the stay. Ask the creditor to enter into a stipulation and order vacating the judgment."

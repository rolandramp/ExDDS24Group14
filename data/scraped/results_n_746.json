        "In addition to the answer from the other attorneys, I can't help but wonder whether you have been getting harassed by debt collectors and creditors. There are powerful federal laws that govern the conduct of debt collectors and creditors, and you could be entitled to recovery if they are violating your rights. Under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (\"TCPA\"), if creditors or debt collectors are calling your cell phone using an automated system (robocalls), and the calls are made without your consent, each call could be worth $500. In addition, creditors and debt collectors are bound to comply with the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (\"FDCPA\"), and they are prohibited from harassing you with excessive calls or aggressive tactics. If the debt collectors are violating the FDCPA when attempting to collect the debts, you might be entitled to up to $1,000. I recommend you contact an experienced consumer protection attorney for advice. Most consumer protection attorneys do not charge for their services.",
        "Should you file depends on many facts of your partucular situation. This is the right time to obtain a confidential consultation with an attorney to discuss the details, options, potential outcomes of those choices.",
        "You can file a claim of exemption to try to reduce the garnishment. You can also consult with a bankruptcy attorney to see what that looks like and if it makes sense in the context of your overall financial situation.",
        "Filing is up to you, if you qualify. Local attorneys will provide you with a free consultation and determine whether you qualify. Qualifying is based on income and assets. If you do decide to file for a Chapter 7 then your wage garnishment can be stopped. Consult with a local attorney asap for a phone or in person consultation."

    "title": "How can I stop a collection agency from calling me?",
    "question": "A collection agency has been calling my home for over a year. It is an automated message, which doesn't allow you to speak to a person even if you pick up the phone. The message doesn't ask to speak to any specific person. It only says 'this is an attempt to collect a debt. Any and all means will be used for this purpose'. The message goes on to say that they must be contacted, and they give a reference number, however I don't owe any money to anyone, and don't even know who this company is trying to reach. If I call with the reference number, a person wants my full name, and wants me to verify my mailing address, which I am unwilling to give under these circumstances.",
    "answers": [
        "A collection agency can not engage in tactics that violate California's Fair Debt Collection Practices Act.\nIncluding harassing phone calls like the ones you describe. You should retain counsel and have your counsel send a \"cease and desist\" letter to the collection agency. Once done, the agency must communicate with the attorney directly. Any deviation from this is actionable and you may receive damages, attorney fees and a restraining order preventing such further calls.",
        "The next time the machine calls and leaves a message, call back and demand the name of the person and his or her employer, and the address. If the person refuses, tell them that under the federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA), 15 U.S.C. ยง1692b(1) and 15 U.S.C. ยง1692d(6), that he (or she) is required to provide \"meaningful disclosure of the caller's identity.\"\n\nOnce you get the address, write a letter to the collection agency, telling them that you want NO MORE telephone communications from them. If the telephone calls don't stop, then make a record or recording of the telephone calls and contact a lawyer who handles debt collection harassment.\n\nYou may already have a case against the collection agency, if you want to bother. But you need to get the name and address of the agency, and they are required to give you that information. Then you can talk to an attorney who handles Debt Collection Harassment cases."

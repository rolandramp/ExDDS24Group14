    "title": "On a Chapter 13 100% plan. The Trustee has been paying my student loan 1200 a month, even through the pandemic.",
    "question": "The Education Department is allowing a refund of loan payments made from March 2020 to December 2020. If I ask for a refund, will that go to the Trustee or me? There may be some student loan forgiveness coming up, and I'd rather that the Trustee reroute the previous payments to other creditors. My student loan balance is less than $14K, and the current political climate is discussing forgiveness of $10K or more of loans.",

        "Don't count on the President or Congress to come to your aid. You can't count on government help because it is just talk most of the time. Also, Congress may not pass the laws the President wants. Talk to your lawyer. If it was me in your position, I would want that student loan gone and paid. It is the worst debt you can have. It is worse than owing the IRS.",
        "The assumption here is that the US Dept. of Ed will in fact refund the amount of money paid to them since March. Money taken through the collection process was refunded, voluntary payments were not. Only certain qualified Federal loans fall within this situation. It is unknow if your loans do.\n\nWithout knowing how much was actually paid, if any, by the trustee, it may not be worth it at all. Further, as indicated, you want as much of your student loan paid through your plan. Having the Chapter 13 Trustee pay on this student loan now is perfect because there is no interest accruing on your student loan. This may not be the case after 1/31/21.\n\nWith respect to \"some student loan forgiveness coming up\", don't bank on that. If and when it does happen, you can deal with that issue then.\n\nYou should really speak with your attorney, if you have one. If not, speak with an attorney who knows Student Loan Law and Bankruptcy law.",
        "A modified Plan is NOT a huge expense in this District; and I would assume that your goal is to pay the student loans as little as possible at this point so that what is forgiven will not have already been paid.\nUnfortunately, you are in a 100% plan so the distinction between dischargeable and non-dischargeable debts is irrelevant. If some of the debt is forgiven, the proof of claim(s) will be modified to reflect the new amount. I don't know how soon you expect that to happen, and I don't know how much other debt you have; but it seems that you're going to want to delay the payments going toward the student loans.\nA possible solution might be to modify the plan to treat the student loans outside of the plan with an income-based repayment plan.",
        "Without knowing more, I would not suggest asking for refund. As Attorney Boyer stated, if a modified plan is required that is a huge expense in further attorney fees most likely as to modify requires many different pleadings and local rules affect it too. And you really should want non-dischargeable debts to be paid in full or as little as possible to start fresh. Then, after your case is discharged if you just want to go give it away to some creditor that is your business. But why not stay the present course? Noone knows what in fact will happen on student loans and whether the Senate will be governed by Republicans vs Democrats which could affect how \"giving\" away any legislation is. Thus, those are my comments and hope they are reflected on by you. But in my state to modify it would be my estimate 3 or more hours in legal fees and then what if the Court denies it and or Trustee objects etc. ? Then you have now incurred more debt to pay in legal fees too. And if the attorney has to file a motion for additional attorney fees, guess who pays? You will be paying for that as well. Food for thought as they say. Good luck. Glad your student loans are getting smaller and smaller.",
        "What does your lawyer say? No lawyer? f you don't have a lawyer, know this: According to statistics reported by the United States Trustee, virtually all non-lawyer 13s are dismissed before completion, including many that fail to even get confirmed. If you want to avoid becoming one of these statistics, please get a lawyer to help you.\n\nThat said, you can call the Chapter 13 trustee to ask about any changes in their policy pertaining to Student Loan repayments in view of COVID-19.",
        "You will need to file a motion seeking to modify your plan in the way that you have described."

        "Since your father died without a Will, I am presuming that your father’s estate is or will be probated. If so, the administrator of his estate must make all reasonable efforts to find out who your father’s creditors are and how much is owed. The administrator is required to publish notice of the Petition for Probate in a newspaper of when the Petition is filed. This publication is designed to notify any creditors that you might not be aware of. The administrator is to pay the legitimate debts on your father’s estate.\n\nIt is also my experience that the credit card companies are quite willing to negotiate a pay-off amount. I was once advised by a credit card company that the end of the month is the best time to seek a favorable reduction on the balance owed on a decedent‘s account. Apparently, some credit card companies like to “clear the books” by the end of the month.\n\nYou/the estate’s administrator should approach the credit card companies with a dollar amount or percentage of the amount owed that you believe is fair. If the estate has some cash to work with, you may be able to convince the credit card companies to take even a lower amount that they can get immediately rather than having to wait for the sale of the house.\n\nGood luck. I hope this helps you.",
        "I am assuming from your question that \"estate\" means home. As a Minnesota Attorney I am unfamiliar with CA probate code, however, many states exempt the home from creditor claims if the decedent's children inherit it. And as stated above, the credit card company needs to have made a tmely claim on the estate, usually one year after death. Also, you are not obligated to pay the debts with your own money. If there isn't enough assets in the estate, then there is a priority to the bills, and some will not be paid. I recommend you contact an attorney in CA.",
        "It is my experience that many credit card companies will negotiate for the payment of claims. Rememebr that claims must be properly filed and timely made to be paid; otherwise, you can object to the claim. Also, certain expenses - legal, funeral and administrative - may have priority over credit card claims."

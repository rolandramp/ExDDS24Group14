        "You can always try to negotiate debts with creditors. However, it is true that you're not going to be able to do it without it adversely affecting your credit. Most credit card companies (not all, though) will not even think about it if you are not already behind on your debts, so you often need to stop paying on your cards before you start negotiating the debts (and they will offer reduced rates themselves if you are behind). You can try before letting yourself go behind, to negotiate the debts by calling each creditor and asking to negotiate. Some of them might be willing to. Make sure to request an agreement in writing, as you want to make sure that the payment (in these cases you typically pay a lump sum as part of the settlement) is deemed as payment in full.\n\nIt is also true that there can be tax ramifications as the creditor will issue you a 1099-C for the cancellation of debt. How this will impact you depends on your circumstances, and you would likely want to consult an accountant or tax attorney about the tax issues that this will involve.",
        "Is it possible? Sure. Is it likely? No.\n\nIf the accounts are current, there is little reason for the creditor to accept less than is due. If the credit card company thinks you have the funds to pay them, there is little reason for it to accept less than is due.

        "Generally, credit card companies may accept 70% or more to settle a debt and close an account. They may not do that right away.

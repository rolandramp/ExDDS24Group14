    "title": "I am being sued for outstanding HOA fee. What are my options???",
    "question": "The house is already foreclosed. The pay off demand is $5,000. My original debt is $2500 including the late fees with all the fees they added (collection and attorney's fees) it doubled. I am trying to negotiate if they can reduce the debt but they havent acknowledge my requests. What can I do? Can they really garnish my wages and wipe off my bank account? Is there a way that I can convince them to reduce my debt? What are my options? Thank you so much.They are giving me 5 days to pay and I dont have the money. Even if I do monthly installments for a year I still could not afford it. And the interests for payment plans is$25/mo plus one time set up fee of $200. It is just too much. PLS HELP!!!!",

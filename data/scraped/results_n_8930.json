    "title": "Can I sue my ex-wife for credit card debts if she files for Chapter 13?",
    "question": "Ex-wife and I divorced 3 years ago and split everything. She kept one of our joint CCs and notified the bank of our divorce. The bank said they will take care of it. Ex-wife, thinking the card was solely hers, incurred 70k in credit card debt. I learned that my name is still in the card when the bank notified me. I closed the account since and ex-wife has been paying the monthly due on time; however, I learned that she plans to file for Chapter 13, which means her credit card debt will be absolved. Will this mean the credit card company will come after me? Can I personally collect from ex-wife or sue her for contempt (or non-payment) even after she filed for Chapter 13? What's my recourse? If she files for Chapter 7, what's my recourse? THANKS in advance.",

        "Whether or not you can sue your wife will depend on whether or not she committed some kind of fraud against you (which seems likely because she used the cards without your consent) or if the property settlement created an order in the nature of support requiring her to repay the cards to your beneefit. If these circumstances arise you can (must) bring an adversary within a specified period of time in order to have the debt declared non-dischargeable as against you. The creditors will still pursue you as the divorce did not affect their rights to collect from you directly.",
        "Unless your divorce decree makes her responsible for this debt, any debt remaining after the plan is completed, will be discharged as to her only. Your obligation will remain. You can try to challenge her plan (in a 13) or discharge (in a 7 or 13), but you would have to prove that the debt is an exception to discharge. I see nothing here that shows this. Upon separation incident to divorce, it is always a good idea to close joint accounts. Failing to do so means that you remain liable for that portion of the debt not paid in your ex-wife's Chapter 13.\n\n[This communication is intended as general information and not specific legal advice, and this communication does not create an attorney-client relationship.]",
        "I am confused about whether your wife is filing Chapter 7 or 13. Ch. 7 means she wipes out this and all other debts. Ch. 13 means she makes payments on the debts through the Bankruptcy Trustee and if the makes all the payments as planned, then she will be done with all the debts at the conclusion of her case. Ch. 13 usually requires legal help, but many people prefer the benefits of a lawyer in a Chapter 7. If she files Chapter 7, you cannot touch her with a lawsuit, unless you can prove she committed fraud or contemptible conduct related to this and file the appropriate papers about it (an adversarial proceeding) in her bankruptcy case. Maybe she did, as the bills would probably have shown both of your names, which should indicate she was aware you were still on the account. If she files Ch. 13, she will be making payments on the debt, so I am not sure you can claim she is in contempt, but you may have the right to seek any recovery of damages against her for her not closing this account, if that was part of the terms of your divorce decree. Consult with your family law attorney on this, as well.\n\nRegardless of which type of bankruptcy she files, the bank will probably claim that you are liable for the full unpaid balance, because you did not close the joint account or give them notice in writing that you would not be responsible on the account, following the divorce. Debts incurred after formal separation or divorce are normally considered that person's separate debts, not part of your community debts. This is a different situation, because this was a joint account and the bank did not close it, so you remained a joint account holder after divorce, when she incurred the charges. I am not sure how a court will find on this, and it may depend on whether you can prove that telephone call that your ex claims she had with the bank. If it did happen, perhaps that can get you off this account, but it will be a battle."

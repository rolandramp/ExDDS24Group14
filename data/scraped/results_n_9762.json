    "title": "Can a credit card sue you in another County once the case has been dismissed in the County you live in?",
    "question": "I was served with a Complaint and Summons on a credit card debt in LA County Superior Court. I filed an Answer and received our first court date. On the date of the hearing, an attorney for the credit card company filed a Motion to Dismiss which was granted.. Now, a month later, I received another Complaint and Summons from the same credit card company and lawyers but from another County... Can they do that??",

        "Keep in mind that the original creditor may have sold this debt to another collection service, which has no idea you have receivedd a dismissal. You need to serve the judgment for dismissal on the court and on the adversary. You might also be able to file a motion to dismiss based on res judicata (the matter has already been decided). Do NOT ignore this new complaint. Unscrupulous law firms often secure improper judgment orders and then file judgment liens against you.",

It seems unusual for credit card company's lawyers to do what you described. Was their motion seeking to dismiss WITHOUT prejudice so they can file the action in a different court? If so, they may be able to re-file the lawsuit. You should immediately consult your own attorneys to help protect your legal rights."

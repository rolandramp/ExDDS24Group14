        "A personal bankruptcy can be used to protect you from debts that are your personal liability to pay. Shareholders of corporations are generally not personally liable for the corporation's debts, but could be if they personally guaranteed the corporation's obligations, or if a creditor pierces the corporate veil to impose personal liability on the owners. Its unclear here why you believe you are liable for the corporation's debts. Nevertheless, as Mr. Daymude pointed out your 2016 bankruptcy will not help you if the debts arose after you filed. You should consult with the bankruptcy attorney who handled your 2016 case about these issues. Or if you don't feel comfortable working with that attorney again, you should find a new one in your area to advise you about these issues.",

        "The lease is just a contract between you and the lanlord making you solely responsible according to its terms. Based on her not being on the lease it is your responsibility to obtain an order for exclusive use of your dwelling especially if your spouse did not surrender possession by giving you the keys. California Law provides that your spouse is entitled to half of all \"community property\". Hence, your spouse will claim she only picked up her community share. You must obtain an inventory of what your spouse took. You will list those items and all other property in your schedule of assets and debts which is part of the required disclosure in all divorces. If your spouse took something very valuable or that has high sentimental value you may have to schedule an emergency or regular hearing to obtain it back. Otherwise, your ex would just have to pay you an equalization payment if she took more than her half. Generally it is not advisable to litigate over furniture and furnishings as those are assigned garage sale value by the court."

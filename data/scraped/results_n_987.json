    "title": "Chapter 7. If trustee goes after a relative that I gave money to (as a fraudulent transfer) can my relative sue me after?",
    "question": "So, I gave certain money to a relative of mine. It was essentially a verbal agreement / business deal about 2 years ago. Then later I filed chapter 7 and now the trustee is about to demand the return of this sum of money from my relative. Our relationship has soured and she is sure to say it was a business deal and that I am \"screwing her over\". So, would my relative have any recourse against me such as a lawsuit after the bankruptcy? Also, can I get in trouble with the trustee or court for all of this? I have been honest about everything. What happens if the relative can't come up with the money the trustee is asking for?",

        "If the trustee goes after the relative, the relative will have \"actual knowledge\" of the bankruptcy case. Since the transfer avoids a pre-petition payment of a debt that existed pre-petition also, that debt is dischareable. However, to avoid the consequenses of a possible claim or nondischargeability under Bankruptcy Code Section 523(a)(3), you should amend Schedule F (now E/F) to add this person as a creditor.\n\nThe relative may have defenses to this action, based on what you said in your question. If the money was paid in repayment of a debt, the repayment can't be avoided if it happened more than 1 year prior to the filing of the bankruptcy. If this was just a transfer of an asset, the trustee can recover if the transfer was 2 years or less prior to the filing, but also has more to prove. These time periods relate to which statute the trustee is using to recover. The statute for fraudulent transfers will be the 2 year time period.\n\nYou should be discussing this with your bankruptcy attorney and he/she can advise you about what this all means. Strictly speaking, you are not in trouble as long as you made a full disclosure of the transaction.",
        "If you have been honest about everything there will be no trouble with the trustee. I agree with my colleagues that you should amend to add this relative as a creditor. Additionally, if this was in the ordinary course of business there may be an exception for fraudulent transfer or preference payment.",
        "You should list her if you owe money and serve her under the law. Unless she has a claim against you that falls within one of the exceptions to the law, or even if she does and does NOT file an adversary by the deadline date, then the debt will be forever barred and discharged!\n\nThe money is applied to his attorney fees, his trustee fees, and then to creditors in the order that the Bankruptcy Code sets forth .",
        "Yes. Trustee has authority to demand return of fraudulent transfer from transferee.\nMaybe. Relative may sue you for amount returned if debt not discharged. If debt discharged, relative may not sue for the amount returned to trustee.",
        "If she has actual knowledge in time to file a complaint to determine dischargeability, then there may not be a need to add her as a creditor. However, I agree with Ms. Bunce. The safe thing to do would be to add her as a potential creditor giving her 60 days from that point to object to discharge. If you receive your discharge, then she would not be able to recover any money from you.\n\nAs long as you did not hide the information from the trustee and the money was transferred to her more than one year ago, I don't see a real chance that the chapter 7 trustee or the US Trustee will object to discharge.

        "Yes the trustee is likely to seek the return of the money if the amount involved was significant. Better amend your petition to include this relative as a creditor so your debt will be clearly covered by your discharge. Hope this perspective helps.",
        "Sounds like the trustee is claiming a fraudulent transfer to hide money the trustee might otherwise get. Yes, he can proceed against your relative to \"disgorge\" the money. If she doesn't have it, it is possible the trustee would sue her, get a judgment, and record a lien on her property. Next, the trustee might refer your case to the US Trustee's office for bankruptcy fraud. Your discharge can be denied, you can be fined, and yes, possibly be sentenced to prison time, depending on the amount, your intent, etc. Calling something a business investment when it is not is bankruptcy fraud.

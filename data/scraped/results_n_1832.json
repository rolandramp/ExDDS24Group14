    "title": "What can I do if my bank account is levied?",
    "question": "My bank account just got levied, and every dime of what little money I had in my account was taken. I'm going through some hardships an am unemployed at the moment and they just took everything I had. Got a notice from my bank that I still owe about $5,000. What can I do if I'm unable to pay for the debt? Even when I find a job, how will I be able to survive if they are just going to take every penny I deposit into my account? Who can I seek for help? Thank you",

        "I assume there was a judgment rendered against you for the debt you owe. If so, the judgment creditor can levy your bank accounts and garnish your wages (if you were employed). If you are a debtor in California who has difficulty satisfying a judgment after being served with a Writ of Execution, you can file a Claim of Exemption along with a Financial Statement. A Claim of Exemption is a form a debtor files with the levying officer (like the sheriff) explaining why bank accounts should not be levied and/or the wages that the creditor wants the debtor’s employer to garnish should be exempt (excluded). The forms for wage garnishments are:\n\nhttp://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/wg006.pdf\n\nhttp://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/wg007.pdf\n\nTurn in 2 copies of the Claim of Exemption (Form WG-006) and the Financial Statement (Form WG-007) to the levying officer in your case (like the sheriff) within 10 days of receiving the Notice of Levy. Keep one copy of both forms for yourself.\n\nYour employer will hold on to the money garnished until 10 days go by and the creditor hasn’t opposed the claim of exemption, or the judge makes a decision at the hearing on the claim of exemption. If the creditor doesn’t oppose your claim of exemption, your employer will return the wages to you. If the creditor opposes your claim of exemption, you will receive a Notice of Opposition to Claim of Exemption and Notice of Hearing on Claim of Exemption that will set a court date for a judge to make a decision. If the judge agrees with your claim of exemption, you will get the money back. If the judge agrees with the creditor, your employer will send the money to the creditor every month.\n\nSimilarly, for Claim of Exemption for non-wage garnishments, use Form EJ-160 instead of WG-006:\n\nhttp://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/ej160.pdf"

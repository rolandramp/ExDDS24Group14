        "The answer depends on who you are surrendering the car to, and how much the check is for. If you're planning on surrendering the car to your lender, they probably have the right to the insurance proceeds to satisfy their claim unless you are using the money to repair the car. In fact, the check will probably come payable you and the lender jointly.\n\nIf there is no lender, or there is money left over, whether you keep it or turn over to the trustee depends on whether you can cover it with your exemptions in your bankruptcy. (Exemptions are the lists and amounts of property you can keep when you file chapter 7). There are two sets you can choose from with different rules, and there's no way to give a good answer to that question here.",
        "Yes you can keep the check but you have to show it as an asset, like cask in the bank. See a bk lawyer.",
        "If you have already filed a bankruptcy case, talk to your attorney about this. If you didn't hire an attorney to represent you in the bankruptcy case, that was a mistake. If you have already filed, this isn't a question that will be easily answered here without you disclosing too much confidential information.\n\nIf you haven't filed yet, it is possible to do what you are suggesting, but it is unusual for an insurance company not to make the check out to the lien holder and to you together. If the car was totaled, then you got the check and used it and later filed bankruptcy, there is the possibility that the lien holder will file an action in the bankruptcy to make the debt nondischargeable under Section 523(a)(4) of the Bankruptcy Code for your actions. You must discuss this in person with an attorney prior to filing.\n\nA creditor with that sort of nondischargeability claim has until 60 days after your meeting with the trustee to file that action; they can't do it after that deadline passes. You have to be careful about disclosures in your case. Hiding the facts could potentially extend that time.",
        "Have you already filed for bankruptcy? If so, the petition should have shown the car as being surrendered AND you should have returned it to the dealer as soon as possible after filing-within days if not hours.\nYour contract with the lender on the vehicle may require payments for damage to be used to repair the vehicle.\nYou need to talk to your bankruptcy attorney and give him or her all the details.",
        "I agree with Mr. Steingraber that you should address this question to your attorney. There are too many variables to consider if this is an option with the little permission provided.",
        "This is a question for your BK lawyer. No lawyer? Big mistake. That said, the answer depends on information not provided. Did you exempt the car? When was it wrecked?"

    "title": "Can I refuse to answer irrelevant questions during a debtors exam in CA?",
    "question": "I was sued in small claims and lost. Judge was racially biased in court and I then found out she had publicly stated on numerous occasions she would use her position as a judge to favor a certain demographic. I filed a complaint with the court but the case ruling stood. Now the same judge is in charge of the debtors exam. Does the evidence of racial bias and the fact I filed a complaint provide valid grounds to ask the judge to recuse herself? If not, can I be held in contempt if I don't answer irrelevant questions. Based on my assets I believe I am judgement proof and am also considering chapter 7, but am concerned that the plaintiff will use information she gets from debtors exam to retaliate. She has already showed up at my place of employment and taken property without going through the courts or sheriff.",

        "One of the advantages of filing for Bankruptcy prior to the judgment creditors exam is the Automatic Stay it will protect you from having to answer any questions at the examination, also if you have other debts it will help you clear up your financial situation and stop other creditors from taking you to court on any past debts.",
        "Filing bankruptcy can make those issues go away. Bankruptcy prevents judgment creditors from enforcing their judgments such as contacting employers or executing bank levies. It appears you are already considering chapter 7 bankruptcy. This may in fact be the best option for you depending on your financial circumstances. I suggest reaching out to a bankruptcy lawyer to schedule a free consultation.",
        "Why dont you first see a bankruptcy attorney because if you file 1st, you can eliminate all the other issues as the \"stay\" of filing stops all other normal legal actions . if you do fail to answer, possibly it could maybe turn into a non-dischargeable debt too so watch that. But since you stated you might file I will point out issue next on bankruptcy.\n\nYour asking that question implies you have not called and discussed with an experienced bankruptcy attorney near you as you would or should know the answer to that question posted here on AVVO. Other facts and issues can gravely affect your case so I will point these out for you next some issues so you know you only need to do one thing now: call an attorney near you to discuss bankruptcy. You need and want to enjoy your fresh start also. But the most important thing is to meet with an attorney as you asking this question means you have not. You care about 2 goals: keeping everything you have equity in and discharging all your debts. If you don't have any of the exceptions to discharge you will obtain that goal; most exceptions are set forth in 11 USC. 523 (Google it) like child support, some income taxes, traffic (in a ch 7) and criminal fines , and presumption of student loans. But some debts are dischargeable in a ch 13 but NOT in a ch 7 so you want to make sure and your attorney will discuss any such types with you also!\n\nYour exemptions depend on what state you have lived in in the last 2 years and thus if in your state, then your states exemptions will apply. Most persons filing keep everything they own but your attorney will confirm that with you when they learn everything you own and the equity thereof!\n\nSome secured debts like homes, vehicles, other secured debts an attorney will discuss your options on also as you must list any debts; but that does not mean you will lose them unless you have too much equity or are in default on paying for them! Discuss those options if they apply with your attorney too.\n\nBut other issues can arise that can greatly harm your case. Just one example: If you paid back a relative $3,000 11 months ago and now file bankruptcy next week, the trustee can SUE that relative to retrieve that $3,000 (under what is called a preference) for the benefit of the bankruptcy estate. As a result, most attorneys don't charge to meet with them the first meeting so meet with one no matter what.\n\nMany great attorneys can be found right here on AVVO in your state so look, call, and meet one as soon as you can.\n\nYou should also want to know when to file: is there an advantage of waiting versus filing now and who should you pay between now and then! Good luck and enjoy your later fresh start."

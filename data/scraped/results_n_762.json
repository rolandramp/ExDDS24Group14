        "Be careful. Your best bet is to contact an experienced bankruptcy attorney who specializes in chapter 7 and chapter 13 cases and who knows how family law interplays with bankruptcy. I suggest you have a free initial consultation with one of the bankruptcy attorneys found here on AVVO.",
        "It is best to find both your family law attorney and your bankruptcy attorney now to help you determine if it is better to file your bankruptcy or your divorce first. Also contact your PI Attorney to discuss your plans to file bankruptcy and whether listing your medical bills will affect your PI case, when you file bankruptcy you are required to list all of your creditors. This may affect your decision to file a joint or separate bankruptcy cases.\nBankruptcy will allow the division of the people (the spouses) to go forward - so if you need to end the marriage, you can start that process right away. Filing a bankruptcy will not stop that process.\nRegarding your property (PI Proceeds and whatever else you have an interest in) Bankruptcy has a 'claw back' provisions that allows the Bankruptcy Trustee to undo a Marital Settlement Agreement up to 2 years (can be extended up to 7 years) before the Bankruptcy Petition Date, if the division looks unfair on its face. Most Marital Property Settlement Agreements merely divide the property without explaining why the division is fair.\nThe 704 Exemptions are actually California State Exemptions, and there is a choice between 703 & 704 if you file a bankruptcy in California. 704 has a large homestead exemption. Unless you have have large amounts in private retirements or expecting a large PI Settlement and if you are a renter, usually 703 is a better choice because of the 'wildcard' exemption.\nAfter you consult with a competent bankruptcy attorney in your area you will know whether it is a better remedy to your financial situation to file together as husband and wife, with one case, one filing fee, and eliminate all of the dischargeable debts, or file separate bankruptcies now or after your divorce.\nThere can also be complications filing a bankruptcy when the MSA lists certain creditors; the status of the creditor can change from dischargeable to non-dischargeable.\nBest to consult with expert attorneys in your area before you chooses the remedy for your financial stress.",
        "Your questions and fact patterns are quite convoluted; but it sounds like you're considering filing BK as well.\nMy advice would be to first file a joint Ch7 with your husband. This would essentially eliminate any issues with non-dischargeable (in a Ch7) debts arising from the divorce. You mentioned 704 so I assume you have a home with equity; but you've given us absolutely no information about that home. Obviously you're going to need a local attorney (with more information than we have) to give you the best advice.\nYour PI lawsuit will be property of your BK estate and may be exempt to the extent you have already paid med bills; but the lien(s) on the insurance proceeds will be paid to the doctors, one way or another, so I'm not sure what you are trying to preserve there.",
        "There are many issues that you raise. You would best be served by sitting down with a local experienced bankruptcy attorney to discuss the facts and circumstances of your claim. In some instances it is better to file for divorce first and in others there may be no need to. Most bankruptcy attorneys offer a free consultation.",
        "While I concur with the advice offered by my colleagues, I suggest the following: If possible, do the BK before the divorce, because you may eliminate most if not all unsecured debt which will simplify a later property settlement in which debts and assets are allocated between the parties. One BK for the both of you will also be less expensive the two BKs later on.\n\nThat said, your PI claim will have to be included as an asset, no matter when and how you file. Depending on your overall property details, you may be able to exempt a portion of your expected recovery.",
        "You have complicated questions/issues going on here. You really need counsel. I suggest you get to a qualified/reputable bankruptcy attorney ASAP. Sometimes it works best to file the bankruptcy together before the marriage is terminated. Sometimes that's not possible. Sometimes it's best to file the divorce first. In addition, if there's a personal injury award coming or received, you need the assistance of counsel to advise you how much, if ANY portion of that award can be protected/exempted. Exemption planning before filing is the key to maximizing the benefits of filing a bankruptcy. I hope this helps.",
        "There are too many issues in your fact pattern to answer everything here, but I will try some of the questions.\n\nFiling before or after divorce depends upon the outcome of the divorce. For example, if you are required to pay debt for your ex, filing a chapter 13 afterwards would allow you to discharge that obligation.\n\nWith respect to the issues related to the PI claim, whether any portion of the claim is exempt (protected from creditors and the chapter 7 trustee) and how much of the claim is exempt will depend upon which exemption scheme you choose in California.\n\nThe best way to answer these and many other questions is to take advantage of a free initial consultation with an experienced bankruptcy attorney that handles chapter 7 and chapter 13 cases even if you think you need to file under chapter 7. Become educated on all the issues involved and related to your current economic situation, find out the advantages and disadvantages for filing under each chapter and use an attorney that can help you make the right decision for you. Most bankruptcy attorneys will meet with you at no charge for the initial appointment. You can use the Avvo \"Find a Lawyer\" link at the top of this page to search for an attorney.\n\nIf you are considering filing pro se, you need to understand that the per a US Courts study performed in 2011, pro se chapter 7 bankruptcy cases are 8 times more likely to be dismissed than chapter 7 cases filed with attorney representation and the success rate for pro se chapter 13 debtors is around 55 times worse than attorney represented debtors. The biggest problems that pro se chapter 7 debtors have are the issues that they do not realize could be a problem, resulting in their case being dismissed, the loss of assets to the trustee, the loss of assets to creditors or the payment of debts to creditors that are not necessary.\n\nWe see pro se bankruptcy filers on this forum every week that are asking questions about how to extricate themselves from the mess that they are in. Some are about to lose some of their assets or spend a substantial amount of money to correct the problem because they did something wrong or failed to understand why the asset would be taken by the chapter 7 trustee. Many times those filers are going to spend much more than those debtors would have paid a lawyer to do thing right the first time.",
        "Some of your guestion is unclear...but as to whether you divorce of file first: I typically recommend that the divorce should be finalized first. There may be property settlements obligations that arise that could be discharged in a subsequently filed chapter 13 setting (not in a chapter 7). The PI case is an asset of whichever spouse has a legitimate claim to recovery, and will become property of the bankruptcy estate. In a 13, you may be able to keep it subject to plan terms.

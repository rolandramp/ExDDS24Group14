    "title": "Can a levy officer located in one county take possession of a bank account in another county?",
    "question": "The creditor had three writs of executions and a couple of levies. One for each county. But can the LO cross into another county?",
    "answers": [
        "I concur with Mr. Elie. Yes, if the bank has branches in the county where the levying officer is located. If you are concerned, close all bank accounts in large banks and only have an small account in a local credit union or small bank. Consult a debt collection DEFENSE attorney or bankruptcy attorney to resolve the judgment, so that you don't need to worry about this in the future. The judgment will remain enforceable until satisfied in full, discharged, or set aside if the default judgment was obtained without proper service on the defendant. See link below for options, if the lawsuit was not properly served and this is a default judgment.",
        "Reposting under debt settlement. You ate the debtor.",
        "The writ can be served on any branch of a bank if it has a branch in one county or another.\n\nThe question here is whether or not you asserted your exemptions or moved to quash the writ timely.\n\nIf this is your account or another debtor has signatory powers, whether you filed your 3rd party claim with whichever levying officer levied the writ.\n\nWith respect to levying in one county for another, California law (CCP ยง 684.115) requires all financial institutions with 10 or more branches to designate a central location for service of process. Therefore if LA Sheriff levies, and the central location is in some other county, then the sheriff of that county or a process server serves the writ with instructions to turnover funds to the Sheriff of the county that its being levied in."

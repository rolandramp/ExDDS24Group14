    "question": "Hi,",
    "answers": [
        "Regardless of whether you paid your settlement in full, you should start with trying to determine why the automatic debits stopped. Sometimes they stop because of a glitch on their end, or it may be that one of the debits was denied due to the bank or insufficient funds, or (and this goes to your theory) that it was some sort of bad faith or malice. The last is most difficult to prove. However, the company may have violated the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act for promising a settlement and to debit your account to comply with the settlement, then suing you when you were complying, due to some error on their part and they failed to contact you to get the payments restored. Possibly also breach of contract?\n\nYou also may have a defense of accord and satisfaction, because you hand an agreement (an accord) that you made good (or so it appears), thus satisfying the rest of the debt. I would not try to handle this yourself, it is one thing to discuss it in an open forum such as Avvo, but more complicated to actually put onto paper so that the court will allow it and get it to trial. People who start defending themselves often hire a lawyer, when they realize that they are in over their head with civil procedure, so the don't get a judgment against them.",
        "As the debt collectors know....you will not have the benefit of counsel so they push the limits of the law and process to bend you over a barrel.\n\nThe fact is that you are missing a zero in the outstanding balance to justify hiring counsel. Send me $5000 and I will get your case dismissed and settled. Quick, cheap (for legal representation) , and easy....no retainer, no payments, in and out...\n\nBut you can do the same thing for $3655 unless they are accruing legal and filing fees so that will soon surpass the $5000 mark...."

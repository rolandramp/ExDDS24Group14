    "title": "Can a homestead protect against a lien from the state of California?",
    "question": "My partner is on the title of our duplex but not on the mortgage and he received a judgement in court (from the state of California) in excess of $300,000. We forgot about the fact that we filed a homestead many years earlier. Is it possible to have the lien removed so that we can refinace because of the homestead?",

    "answers": [
        "How long ago was the judgment lien filed? The statue of limitations on judgments in California is ten years (in some cases ten years and six months) but they can be renewed for an additional ten years. If the judgment is over ten years old, you make be off the hook as it were. See a lawyer for details.",
        "I agree with Ms. Espada. You are not going to be able to remove the lien unless you settle the debt and the creditor files a release of the lien or your partner file may qualify to file bankruptcy to have the lien avoid by filing a \"motion to avoid the lien.\" In order for this motion you will need to show that there is no additional equity in the property once any mortgages plus your homestead exemption are taken into account. For a single person, the homestead exemption is $75k. I recommend speaking with some experienced bankruptcy attorneys to see if filing bankruptcy to eliminate this lien is possible.",
        "The lien can be removed by paying the debt, or by filing a bankruptcy case and seeking to \"avoid the lien.\" If the judgment is for a tax debt, it may not be possible to avoid the lien. Discuss your options with a bankruptcy attorney in your area."

        "There is no requirement that you first separate before divorcing. Nor is legal separation necessarily less expensive than divorce. If your goal is to divorce, starting with a legal separation will basically double your legal and attorney's fees (should you retain an attorney) in that the process and court fees are the same. If your concern is cutting off community property and debt, you can do so be telling your husband that you want out of the divorce. I recommend doing it in writing - this creates a \"date of separation\". Date of separation, among other things, is the cut off date for debts acquired \"during marriage\", for which you are both responsible, and separate debts acquired after date of separation (the obligation of the one who incurred the debt). However, it is also a cut off for spousal support in short term (under 10 years) marriages. Depending on the length of your marriage and the assets and debts you acquired during that time, and if there was any \"co-mingling\" of your separate property assets/debts with that of the community, your case may or may not be very complicated. The absence of children does not ensure and easy, inexpensive divorce. If you were married less than 5 years, own no real property, and have limited assets and debts, you may even be able to qualify for a summary dissolution - inexpensive compared to other situations. You really need to get yourself more informed before making a mistake than can really cost you later on. I invite you to attend a workshop that I and a colleague offer called \"Second Saturday\", What Every Woman Should Know About Divorce. You can view specific information about the program I offer in Rancho Cucamonga on my website, www.wcmediate.com. If you would like a brochure, e-mail or call me and we can make arrangements to get it to you. You can also call the general information and registration number at (909) 945-0626. The workshop is offered the second saturday of every month (the next one is June 13).\n\nIn addition, my colleague is absolutely correct: mediation is a much less expensive way to resolve your divorce out of court. It is the least expensive option among all conflict resolution processes. You should still have an attorney advising you even during this process since a mediator acts as a neutral and cannot advise you any more than s/he can advise your husband.\n\nYou may have many options. Without knowing more, it's difficult to discuss every possibility. You really should call an attorney/mediator/collaborative attorney who can best help to guide you towards achieving your goals.

        "The main difference between a legal separation and a divorce is that after you receive your final judgment from your divorce you may remarry, whereas, you may not remarry after filing a legal separation only. Many people file for legal separations for religious purposes. If you spouse is willing to participate in mediation, perhaps that would be one way of keeping the costs down (no litigation). Also, because you have no children, unless you are unable to come to an agreement for whatever debts or assets you have, the costs for both should be very similar. You also do not indicate how long you were married or what your assets or debts are. You may be eligible to file for a summary dissolution if you meet the criteria."

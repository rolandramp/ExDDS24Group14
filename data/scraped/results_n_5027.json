        "If you are representing yourself and you do not have an attorney some creditors will file objection to discharge hoping you will not answer the lawsuit and the debt will be determined to be non-dischargeable. If the creditors want to object to your ability to obtain a discharge they can file an adversary proceeding, which is a lawsuit in the bankruptcy. You have to answer that (oppose it) if you don't they can win by default.",
        "Yep....I'm 22 years in this business and never heard of that phrase, and do not see any such creditors objecting more often than others. In my client's cases we have objections in less than 1% of all cases from ANY creditor.

    "title": "Homestead Credit determination for a sheriff's auction property sale to satisfy a debt",
    "question": "The creditor says we are only eligible for the amount that the Homestead Credit was when the original lien was entered against our home ($50k owner, $25k spouse, $75k total). Our bankruptcy attorney believes that we are eligible for the new rates that were in affect when the Judgement for the Sheriff's Auction was approved by the O.C. Court (early 2018), which would be $100k since the owner credit had been increased to $75k (spouse remained at $25k). We just need a source that we can cite to verify which it is. We have been unable to sell our home for enough money to satisfy the creditors under a bankruptcy we entered to halt the Sheriff's Sale, so we need to know what we are entitled to, in clear terms, to deal with the creditor (who has been less than honest and ethical). Please advise. Thank you.",

        "Attorney Sinclair is correct, but you will also need to determine the status of the statute of limitations to your tax tax debts. The problem you face is that the statute of limitations to be able to discharge your debts in bankruptcy may not have expired, because the IRS typically requires that the statute of limitation be suspended during the period of time that you have agreed to be in an installment agreement.\n\nYour first step is that You need to employ a tax professional to review your tax transcripts and determine whether the statute of limitations has expired that allows you to file bankruptcy.\n\nGood Luck",
        "Now would be an excellent time to consult with and obtain a full review of your financial and family circumstances with an experienced bankruptcy lawyer. How a single mother ended up with a $70K tax bill is a mystery, but irrelevant. Some tax arrearages can be discharged in bankruptcy, and it is time to learn very precisely whether that would be a good strategy for you. If you do not know such a lawyer, use the attorney finder at www.nacba.org.\n\nBest wishes for an outcome you can accept, and please remember to designate a best answer."

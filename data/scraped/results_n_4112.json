        "The Satisfaction only needs to be filed with the County Recorder of the county in which the Abstract was recorded. I am not certain whether or not the Satisfaction must be a certified copy. But, in my experience, I have had no problem with recording copies that were not certified.\n\nGood luck.",
        "For the real property liens Ms. Liewen is correct.\n\nFor the personal property lien you or your client can file the satisfaction or a clerk's certificate of satisfaction. CCP ยง 697.640. Or you can make a demand on the judgment creditor to file a lien release. CCP ยง 697.510(g)(2) and (h). I'm not sure why there are these alternative means for releasing the personal property lien.",
        "If Abstracts were recorded against real property, I would file a certified copies of the Satisfaction of Judgments with the County Recorder in the county where is property is located. You do not have to file with the Secretary of State. There are fees for certified copies and there are recording fees. The fee schedule should be available online. If the property is in Oakland, the county is Alameda. Good luck."

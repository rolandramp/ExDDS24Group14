    "title": "Can a bankruptcy attorney reverse a chapter 7 filing in California after it has been discharged?",
    "question": "The bankruptcy attorney is a friend of one of my family members. He gave me a low down payment for my chapter 7 bankruptcy because I was unemployed. I promised to make payments. The bankruptcy was discharged in February 2012. I told him I would make a $100.00 payment every month until it is paid off because that is really all I can afford. Now they are threatening to reverse my chapter 7 if I don't give them all the money immediately. I told them I honestly don't have the money and would keep making the payments as long as they don't reverse the chapter 7. Can they really reverse it? Or just sue me? I don't know if it is an empty threat.",

        "What your former attorney is doing is clearly wrongful. The attorney's pre-petition fees were discharged in your case, and the discharge injunction bars all attempts at collection of the fee. While a Chapter 7 case can be reopened and a discharge vacated to allow the case to be dismissed, doing so is highly unusual and you alone would have standing to seek the voluntary dismissal of your case. This might occur where a debtor came into a sizable amount of money more six months after the case was filed and wanted to pay his or her debts and erase the record of the bankruptcy for credit purposes. But attorneys cannot use such a threat to collect fees, discharged or not.\n\nWhat your former attorney is doing is clearly a violation of the discharge injunction and may be punishable as a contempt of court, allowing you to recover damages, including attorney's fees you may incur in enforcing your discharge, and where the violation is egregious, you may be able to recover for emotional distress. In addition, your former attorney is violating the California Rules of Professional Conduct and may be subject to discipline. The State Bar Attorney Complaint Hotline is (800) 843-9053 or visit http://www.calbar.ca.gov/Attorneys/LawyerRegulation/FilingaComplaint.aspx. In addition, bankruptcy attorneys must be admitted to practice in the District in which they file cases and a complaint can be filed with the Bankruptcy Court, directed to the Clerk of the Court.",
        "I am shocked that any bankruptcy attorney would be willing to jeopardize his license to practice bankruptcy law by making such an outrageous claim.\n\nI would write a short letter to the bankruptcy judge & include any documents you have from the attorney so that the court can investigate this matter. This is attorney misconduct.\n\nHope this perspective helps!",
        "No, the discharge cannot be reversed for non-payment of attorneys fees. Not only is the attempt to collect probably a discharge or continuing stay violation, the threat to reverse your discharge is probably a violation of California State Bar ethics rules. The case which states that pre-petition fees are dischargeable debts is Hessinger & Assocs. v. United States Trustee (In re Biggar), 110 F.3d 685 (9th Cir. 1997).",

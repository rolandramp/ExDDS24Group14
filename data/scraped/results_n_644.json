For that you should consult with a debt collection DEFENSE attorney, as well, to see if the accounts can be resolved. Your husband's situation of being disabled may help get these debts resolved. He probably qualifies for free legal assistance from a legal services organization.",
        "In the immediate context, nothing happens. However, the lawyer could likely send the bills to collection after s/he adheres to whatever procedural requirements the California State Bar has imposed for collection of legal fees. Many state bars require counsel to first try to establish a payment plan, or to notify the client of the state bar's fee dispute service (if one exists) before pursuing the unpaid bills further. I recommend that you try to work out a payment plan with counsel as Attorney Doland suggested, but not doing so will not necessarily make this issue go away. I hope that your husband's health rebounds soon. Best wishes to you both.",

        "The means test is not applicable to debtors with primarily business debts. However, your personal residence mortgage probably will be on the personal side, not the business side.

        "First, you are right..Means test wont matter.\n\nSecond, your debt exceeds the ch 13 limits to qualify. Thus, only ch 7 and ch 11 remain and a ch 11 is expensive. I have seen cases where they have argued against you being in a ch 7 where your income is too high even though you cannot do a ch 13! But I would always take the chance to try and do it anyway as you can always do a ch 11 but want to avoid so if possible!\n\nEnjoy your fresh start also if you do file a ch 7 and obtain that discharge.. But the most important thing is to meet with an attorney as you asking this question means you have not. You care about 2 goals: keeping everything you have equity in and discharging all your debts. But other issues can arise that can greatly harm your case. Just one example: If you paid back a relative $3,000 11 months ago and now file bankruptcy next week, the trustee can SUE that relative to retrieve that $3,000 (under what is called a preference) for the benefit of the bankruptcy estate. As a result, most attorneys don't charge to meet with them the first meeting so meet with one no matter what. Many great attorneys can be found right here on AVVO in your state so look, call, and meet one as soon as you can. You should also want to know when to file: is there an advantage of waiting versus filing now and who should you pay between now and then! Good luck and enjoy your later fresh start.",
        "Where I practice, if you have primarily business debt, you can file a Chapter 7 regardless of your income and expenses. My understanding is that this is not universal, and counsel is correct that the totalities of circumstances test may still come into play regarding Chapter 7 eligibility. I highly recommend consulting with a local, experienced bankruptcy attorney to see how the trustees and US Trustee view this issue in your district.",
        "You are basically correct. The means test only applies in consumer cases, so where the majority of your debt is business debt it does not apply. The court and the United States Trustee will, however, use the \"totality of the circumstances\" test to determine whether you are eligible for Chapter 7. It would certainly be a good idea to consult with a knowledgeable bankruptcy attorney to discuss how this test would impact your filing."

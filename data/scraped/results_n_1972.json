        "I agree with Stuart and the other attorneys that said there are consequences to your actions in paying off your loan early. Since 2005, all B/R attorneys have been subject to a gag rule about what B/R advice they can give and what B/R advice they can no longer give, post 2005. That is, we are barred from giving you advice that, if followed, would result in you owing less money to a Creditor than you otherwise would have owed that Creditor, if you had not followed the advice from the attorney as your course of action. You, on your own, and NOT as a result of advice from your lawyer, can make any decision that you believe is in your best interests. Just do not do it because your lawyer told you to. They will not do so.\nBTW, my view is that attorneys work for Clients, and the Clients are always the Boss, So no matter what I said, how could I tell the Boss what to do? How do we know this is true? Because the Boss always signs a paycheck and gives it to the employee. That action is the hallmark of the attorney-Client relationship.\nHere, you are crossing a wide stream, and are 80% of the way to the far bank. You are well-seated on a predictable, reliable, horse, and at present, all but your boots are dry. So, does a prudent and wise rider spur the horse and create a reaction, or does he just stay balanced and ride across to the other side? You live out West, what is the right answer? No B/R advice here, just horse talk. Good luck.",

You should never take any action related to your finances and/or assets in your chapter 13 case without first getting the advices of an experienced chapter 13 bankruptcy attorney that practices before the judge and trustee assigned to your case.\n\nIf you have an attorney, you should go over your concerns with him/her.

        "You can payoff the car loan outside the plan, but be prepared when the Trustee files its motion to increase your plan payments by the amount of the loan payment no longer in your budget.

        "You can payoff the car at this time and it will not cause a problem with getting the discharge. Another thing to consider is paying off the chapter 13. In Contra Costa County the system will let you payoff a chapter 13 once you get to the 55th month."

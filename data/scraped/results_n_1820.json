    "title": "Still on the hook from a creditor in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy?",
    "question": "If a person files for a chapter 7 and did not list a certain creditor in their list of creditors during the filing of the Chapter 7, is the person filing still on the hook from that unlisted creditor? Let's assume the debt is not tax debt, is not student loan, alimony or child support debt.",

        "If you had a no-asset case and the debt is unsecured, I would send the creditor a letter stating that the unsecured debt was discharged in your bankruptcy and the creditor is violating the Discharge Order by trying to enforce the discharged debt. Trying to reopen your case to add a creditor is probably a waste of time and money because of In re Beezley (which is 100% still good law in the 9th Circuit). You might want to hire a bankruptcy lawyer to send the letter for you.\n\nIf the debt is a mortgage or a car loan, this is a different situation and you need to talk to a bankruptcy attorney immediately.",
        "Maybe.\nBeasley was overturned by 2005 BAPCPA.\nAssuming this is no asset case. As long failure to list creditor was excuseable negligence, there should be no problem. Safest thing to do is reopen matter, list creditor, close matter. This will ensure dischargeability.",
        "I believe Beezely was overturned in the 2005 BAPCPA, however I usually recommend my clients send the discharge to creditors in this situation. If the case has not been closed you can always amend to list the creditor. While I dont believe Beezley is still good law, I have yet to see a creditor challenge this based upon not being listed in a no asset case.",
        "I concur with atty Kim. If your case has not been discharged/closed, you can amend your Schedule F to add on the omitted creditor. If your case is closed and a discharged entered and it was a \"no asset\" case, In re Beezley holds that even omitted creditors debts are discharged in a no asset case.",
        "If yours was a \"no asset\" case, meaning you could exempt all your property and there was nothing to distribute to your creditors, generally the unlisted ordinary debts will still be considered discharged, due In re Beezley."

    "title": "Does a Judgement Lien have priority over a UCC filer in first position?",
    "question": "I have a service agreement with a corporation that has filed bankruptcy and I'm an unsecured party. There are two creditors that have a Judgement Lien and a UCC filing perfected. My services are required to secure a tax refund from the State of California. I would like to negotiate with the priority claimant to insure payment for my services.",
    "question_tags": "Bankruptcy,Debt,Bankruptcy and debt",
    "answers": [
        "Generally not. The key here is the word generally. The security of the UCC filer will generally be honored in bankruptcy before a later judgment lien",
        "First in time is first in right!! Have a creditor rights atty analyze the facts here!",
        "No one can answer this without knowing what the UCC lien says and what the deal is with the bankruptcy of the debtor. A UCC lien properly done will have priority over a judgment lien for the subjection of the UCC lien. But those are things to be examined. You should hire a bankruptcy attorney to advocate for you. If you think another claimant is going to be concerned with your wishes, or even that the other claimant is the proper avenue of inquiry, you are very likely incorrect."

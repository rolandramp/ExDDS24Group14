    "question": "My mom died intestate and I (myself) went to court to become executor so i could try to sell her house which had a reverse mortgage on it. I became executor and tried for over a year to sell the house but no luck and the Reverse Mortgage Company foreclosed and the house recently sold at auction. I need to finalize court papers but I don't know what papers to file and I need to know if I am responsible for any of her debt?",

        "The previous attorneys are all correct. You also asked what documents you need to file to finalize the estate. That depends on the type of petition you filed with the Probate Court. If you filed a Petition for Probate, then you will need to file a \"first and final\" (unless you've filed a previous one) accounting and petition for settlement that includes requests for distributions to heirs etc. There are certain requirements for this under the Probate code. If you filed a different type of petition, I would need more information to respond to your question.

        "If you are seeking a default judgment, you need to file and serve your FL-160. It gets filed with the Court with your Default Judgment package if you are seeking orders relating to the award and/or division of property or debts. If you are the Petitioner, it will not undo default status. Your question is too cryptic to enable me to respond further - you should go to your Court's Self-Help Clinic for advice and assistance from a volunteer lawyer if you can't afford a consultation with an experienced Family Law Attorney, although you likely know that you get what you pay for."

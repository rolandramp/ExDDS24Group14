        "You have the amounts counted on your W2. Clearly your employer considers the rent and utilities part of your income.

The real question is whether you have enough income for it to be relevant for the means test.\n\nI would join with the other attorneys and recommend you contact a highly qualified bankruptcy attorney to review your situation and determine whether bankruptcy is what you need. Even if you do the second question is what type of bankruptcy you should file. It never hurts to get the opinion of someone who knows what they are talking about. Given your case would be handled in the Sacramento Federal Bankruptcy Court, your best shot would be to meet with someone who regularly files cases there. Check the avvo ratings and yelp as well as the state bar certified specialist list to find the best attorneys.",

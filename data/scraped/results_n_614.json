    "title": "What is the law in Calif concerning the amount of interest that can be charged by a collection agency on a four year old debt?",
    "question": "I received notice from a collection agency for medical debt 4 years old that I was not aware of. I do not remember ever receiving a bill from the doctor. I sent a dispute letter to the agency, which was reported to the credit bureau. I received a response from the collection agency validating the charges and later the agency reported the debt to the credit bureau, which put a derogatory mark on my credit report and affected my FICO score negatively. The debt collector is continuing to add interest to the debt, changing the amount owed, which is updated on my credit report about every 15 days. Will my credit score be affected each time the amount changes for the same debt? A payment was made by my insurance company for this debt 12/2014. Calif statue of limitations is 4 years. Is the last activity on the account considered the payment made by the insurance company or the date the debt was taken over by the collection agency in August 2018?",

        "Your score may be negatively impacted due to a defaulted account being reported. Owing a little more each time does not help either.\n\nA lot of times the last activity on the account is when a payment was made. Sometimes, it can be difficult to know the date the account was taken over by the debt collector just from looking at the credit report. If the account says opened in August 2018 then that may indicate the date the collection agency took it over. If you have not already I suggest running your free credit report at annualcreditreport.com. This report will give you more details then others out there.\n\nAlso, if you find that you still owe this debt and others and cannot afford to pay them back, then you may just want to consider getting a fresh start and look into your bankruptcy options. If that is the case, then I suggest you speak with a bankruptcy attorney."

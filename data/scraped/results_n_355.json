        "Your question is not clear. Are you already in the process of bankruptcy? If so, you are supposed to disclose the ownership of any Intellectual Property (the TM and Patent). Failure to do so will get you into serious trouble with the court. Transferring ownership of the TM snd Patent to your business partner must be in writing and if you are in bankruptcy this is a terrible idea.",
        "I don't see any bankruptcy issue in your question. If you file bankruptcy, your trademark and patent are assets. The value of your assets is something in which the bankruptcy trustee is interested. Your business partner may have an \"equitable\" interest in those assets but more is needed to persuade a bankruptcy trustee of the validity of such an interest. This is not your fight. If your business partner does not act to perfect his equitable interest into a legal interest, he will likely lose any interest.\n\nIf you decide to file bankruptcy, remember, BK is more than checking boxes on forms you find online. Find/consult/hire a lawyer using the Avvo feature \"Find a Lawyer\". Make a list of 4-5 having many 5 star reviews from satisfied clients. If you don't get a prompt call back from one, go on to the next on your list. Some of us offer a free consultation by phone or in person. Take us up on it.\n\nBecause the bankruptcy process can be handled entirely by phone, email and fax, there is no need to personally visit the lawyer’s office unless you want to.

    "question": "I am a same sex domestic partner in CA. I am going to be unemployed (with no unemployment benefits) and will be unable to pay my personal credit card debt. Will my partner be held responsible for my personal debt? I might need to eventually file personal bankruptcy. We do own a home together (1st & 2nd mortgage). Am I able to file bankruptcy without affecting her credit? Am I even able to file bankruptcy under the circumstances?",

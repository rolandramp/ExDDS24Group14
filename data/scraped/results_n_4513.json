    "question": "My ex-gf and I are selling a house that is currently in escrow. We found out there is a lien against the property. It is because of my ex-gf's debts to that person. Can we sue the person for putting the lien and have them remove it so that we can sell the house or will she have to pay off the debt before we can sell? Thank you.",

        "You don't really provide sufficient facts, so in order to answer some assumptions need to be made. First, I assume your ex-girlfriend is on the title to the property. Also, when you refer to her debts I assume whoever she owes money to has a judgment against her. In California, the judgment lien is governed by statute. If the title search reveals a judgment lien, it means that the judgment creditor has recorded an Abstract of Judgment in the county where the debtor resides. If that is correct, then the judgment lien needs to be paid off and then the judgment creditor must record a Satisfaction of Judgment or alternative form of release of the lien to clear the title to the property so you can sell the house.\n\nTHESE COMMENTS MUST NOT BE CONSIDERED LEGAL ADVICE.

It may not be true that you have to pay off the lien before you can sell the house. Unless the lien is larger than the equity of the house, the lien could be paid from the proceeds of escrow when the property closes and the new owner takes title.",

    "question": "My son signed a quit claim on his condo to me, (2006) he then files for Chapter 7 BK, (2008) at the time an amount of about $2400 is due to the HOA and is not included in his BK, Home was foreclosed in 2010....can the HOA go after me for past due HOA payments ?, HOA filed a law suit in which they obtained judgment against me for over $10,000 (4-9-2014) I never signed a Condominium Rider nor any other documents, all debts were in his name....Was the court right in favoring the plaintiff ? suppose they are....but, I need to correct the dollar amount, their math is wrong....How do I proceed and how much time do I have ?",

        "Did you go to trial? Were you made the owner before or after the bankruptcy?",
        "No, unless the judgment was a default judgment, the court was not correct. In California, even though a house or condo which is part of a homeowners association (HOA) is sold at foreclosure, the owner at the time of the assessments is still personally liable for the HOA dues covering the period of time that such person was the owner.\n\nCalifornia Civil Code ยง1367.1(a) provides: \"A regular or special assessment and any late charges, reasonable fees and costs of collection, reasonable attorney's fees, if any, and interest, if any, as determined in accordance with Section 1366, shall be a debt of the owner of the separate interest at the time the assessment or other sums are levied.\"\n\nThe subsequent buyer or owner of a property is not personally liable for the delinquent assessments of prior owners, pursuant to California Civil Code ยง1466.\n\nSo the missing fact in your post is why is there a judgment against you? Were you served with a summons and complaint? Did you respond and defend the lawsuit? Or was there a default judgment entered against you? An attorney would need to know this information in order to advise you how to proceed and how much time you have."

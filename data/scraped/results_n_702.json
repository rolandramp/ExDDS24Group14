    "title": "Can I be sued for cosigning on a bail bond if the person doesn't pay the 10%?",
    "question": "I got a call from someone saying I cosigned for an ex-girlfriends bail. The bail company is taking me & 2 others (cosigners) to civil court if I don't pay my part $1800 monthly payments of $100 for 18 months or $1200 to settle my 1/3 of the cost now. The only income I have is ssi & ssdi for my mental illness. The person I talked to said they can 25% of my income, my tax refund (I don't get) & put a lien on anything I own. I was not on my medication at the time and did not realize what I was doing aside from signing to get her out of jail & agreeing that she would go to court and the bail place to check in. The civil case is in California I live in West Virginia and don't have the resources to get there. Can they take from my ssi & ssdi or put a lien on anything I own?",

        "If they obtain a civil judgment, they cannot take your social security. If you own real estate, such as a house, they can record a lien which would need to be paid out of escrow when you sell the house.. If you own an apartment building or other real estate, they can put a lien on that. It is extremely difficult / impossible to put a lien on your personal possessions unless you own a luxury car such as a Lamborghini or art such as a Rembrant panting. You should read the bailbond agreement to see what it says about suing you. If they sue you in California, they would need to file a second lawsuit in West Virginia in order to encore the judgment in West Virginia. They would need to pay a court filing fee and pay a lawyer in California, and another court fee and another lawyer in West Virginia. They may not want to waste good money to pursue to in order to obtain a judgment that they cannot enforce.\n\nDo not believe anything that a debt collector tells you, especially if it involves your legal rights."

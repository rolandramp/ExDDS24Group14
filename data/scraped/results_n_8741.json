    "title": "My dad got deported... what will happen to his debt? Does my mom have to pay it? We live in CA. Please help!",
    "question": "Hi! About a year ago my dad was deported. My mother only speaks spanish (she is a U.S citizen though) so finding a job is a bit hard. She hasn't been able to find one so sadly we basically live off Welfare now (she is still looking for a job). I also list some items on eBay so we can have some extra income. Anyway, when my dad was deported we used his credit cards to visit him in his country. My mom also sent him his cards and he was able to use a couple of them. Our problem now is that he is in debt and we don't know what to do! We would pay the bills for him at first but honestly we don't have enough money anymore. Welfare only pays for our housing and food and the rest of the money earned from eBay is for our gas/phone bills. Please help! What do we? I'm 17 so idk how to help my mom!",

        "You'll find that many of the lawyers who are answering questions on Avvo have great compassion for the people asking the question. If his debt goes into default, it will be reported on his credit and they can sue him and anyone whom the collection lawyer determines should be liable on the debt. That may or may not include your mother, but if she is not on the account as a card holder, it is doubtful that they will try to sue her.\n\nRather than worry about this debt and a possible lawsuit, she should wait to see what happens. Government assistance does not pay much, so you have no choice, but stop making the payments and allow this debt to go into default and see what happens next. There are fee legal clinics in your area who can advise her if your mother is sued, and they have interpreters and attorneys who are fluent in many languages. Go to the local courthouse for a complete list of legal aid lawyers in your area.",
        "Your mother can file bankruptcy, however, she may not need to if the credit cards are only in your father's name. If the cards are a joint debt, your mother can bankrupt out of the debt, but the creditors may still pursue your father.\n\nThis answer is for informational purposes only and does not create an attorney client relationship."

    "question": "The final court date for the estate in probate is july 22, there are no debts owed, etc. according to the probate notes area of the court website everything has been submitted properly. My question is when can the cash assets be distributed? When I asked this to the attorney handeling the estate my response was \"who the hell knows how long it will sit on the judges desk after the court hearing\". From all the information I've been able to gather the cash assets should be able to be distributed immediately. If not what is it that we'd be waiting for?",

        "An accounting and petition for distribution must be made before you are allowed to distribute from a probate estate. This allows the beneficiaries and the court to \"check you work\" as the estate fiduciary. Once you are approved by the court, then distribute away, just make sure that you, with your counsel, explain what your distribution plan is, so that the court can approve the methodology as well. This is important, as your methodology can by challanged just as easily as the amounts. With court approval, you are insulated from such potential liability.\n\nIf you would like to discuss you options more, please feel free to email me at andrew@stilwellassociates.net\n\nThis is informational only and is NOT intended to create any attorney client relationship between the asker of the question, any reader of the answer, Stilwell & Associates, Andrew Stilwell, or its affiliates.

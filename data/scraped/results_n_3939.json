        "This is the essence of the Disclosure process! \"Declaration of Disclosures\" means that you are disclosing the relevant information, and providing bank accounts is one surefire way to do this.\n\nIn a divorce, there is nothing to hide.",

        "Somehow this question was posted in the tax law practice area. You should change the practice area to California Divorce, as this is clearly not a tax question.",
        "Absolutely yes. You each owe the other a fiduciary duty, and a duty of full and complete disclosure. You must list on the declaration all assets and debts, including those that are your separate property. This means listing bank accounts, and showing bank statements for those particular accounts.\n\nOver disclosure is better than under. If you fail to disclose an asset, the court can sanction you (penalize you financially) and in the most extreme cases, can award the asset to the other spouse.\n\nI hope this helps!"

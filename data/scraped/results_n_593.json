    "title": "Can a debt collector legally lie, promise not report an old debt (nearing SOL) to credit agencies?",
    "question": "I have a small medical debt that is 7 years and 1 month old (from date of service, not necessarily date of first delinquency, which I assume is later), less than $600. I've never admitted the debt might be valid, nor made any payments. It was incurred in FL, I now live in CA.",

    "answers": [
        "The creditor included this paragraph in its letter because it must do so. The fact that the creditor cannot sue you is law. They are informing you of the law. If you have not paid on this debt for at least 4 years, the debt is \"stale\", and they can only ask you to pay. They cannot sue you to pay it. The negative report should be removed from your credit report after 7 years of delinquency, not since service was provided. I believe this fully answers your question, but I could be wrong, since I only know what you have told me. If you are wrong in your description, then my answer, though generally true, could be false in your circumstance. It's such a small debt. I am not certain that I would challenge it, but it wouldn't hurt to ask the collector to validate the debt.",
        "I don't know what you mean by \"legally lie.\" I think you should take seriously the advisory notice that the debt collector was required to include for your benefit. This debt will soon age out of the credit reporting system. If it continues to be reported seven years after being charged off, you would have a claim for damages against any credit reporting agency that continued to report it. If sued on it, you would have a SOL defense. I don't see any upside to acknowledging the debt collector's attempt to collect it."

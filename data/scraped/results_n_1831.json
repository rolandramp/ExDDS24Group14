    "title": "Is it acceptable to put \"TBD\" for Current Gross FMV in #18 (Total Assets) of FL-142 for preliminary disclosure?",
    "question": "I'm the respondent in this dissolution. I'm wanting to get my preliminary disclosures out soon, but ex has much of what I need to give an honest shot at valuating everything I've disclosed. I know what our assets & debts are, just not all of the values. Being it's just the preliminary disclosure (and I've yet to attempt discovery) - would it be acceptable to list everything, assign values for those items I'm able, and for those I'm still in the dark about - maybe notate with a TBD or something? (which would result in my needing to put TBD in #18 in the FL-142.). Can I do something like this for the PDD? (incuding totals in FDD?)",

        "Attorney straus has given you some good, solid, information, id ad, if you need more, consider consulting with a local attorney.",
        "All of this information is estimated when this is done early on, (Mandating this being done so early is recent-- I think it was unwise, but they didn't ask me.) Use a best guess estimate.",
        "I have seen people do that and list 'tbd' for value or list an estimated value. Very often people put 'unknown' or 'in the possession of the other party.' The mandated exchange is for purposes of disclosing to the other the extent of the separate and community estate because the legislature is aware that one of the spouses may not know this information.\n\nYou did not describe which asset it is that you cannot value. Pensions plans and real estate are perhaps the most common assets where help is needed from an expert. Let us know which asset this is and we can make a further suggestion."

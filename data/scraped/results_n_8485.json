    "question": "We live in California and filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 12/08. We included our 1st and HELOC, but have made payments untile recently. We are current on our 1st, but 2 months late on HELOC. We just received notification that they have reassigned, sold or transferred our HELOC to RTR...can they foreclose on the home",

        "A HELOC is a mortgage just like the 1st. The discharge eliminates your legal obligation to pay the debt, but it does not eliminate the bank's right to foreclose. When a mortgage (including a HELOC) is reassigned, sold or transferred, the new owner of the loan has the same rights as the original owner, which would include foreclosure. It would be a good idea to try to get caught up on the HELOC as soon as possible.",

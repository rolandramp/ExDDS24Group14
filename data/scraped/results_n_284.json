        "Yes, they can still file a lawsuit against you. If that happens you would need to be proactive and file a timely response raising any defenses you have. If you cannot afford to defend the lawsuit or cannot afford to payback the bond then bankruptcy may be the best and most economical option.\n\nMost bonds are just like contracts and most contracts can be eliminated in bankruptcy. Bankruptcy provides relief to the debtor by absolving them of the legal obligation to payback the agreed upon amount under the terms of the contract or bond.\n\nOnce bankruptcy is filed the automatic stay prevents the bond company from pursuing you for the debt owed and once the bankruptcy discharge order is entered, the order legally forbids any collection of that bond debt.\n\nIf you need help with this then you should contact a bankruptcy lawyer.\n\nI hope this was helpful.",

    "question": "I received a cal from Harris Goldberg and association today concerning a payday loan that was taken out December 2007. I made arrangements with the payday loan company to make payments over the course of four months until it was paid off. I do not have the paid in full letter because it was way back in 2007. I do in fact have my bank statements showing four payments of $90 to the payday loan company. I informed the Harris and Goldberg of this information and they said that bank statement would not show proof debt was paid in full. This is the second company calling about the same debt and I explained that to him and he said that scammers so that all the time.",

You will get a default judgment against you and at that point, you are out of luck. However, if you were to show up to court, you have an Affirmative Defense...the statute of limitations in California is 4 years to collect a debt arising from a contract...if you assert this defense, it is a complete defense and the case is dismissed. DO NOT IGNORE A LAWSUIT IF IT IS FILED. Additionally, they can still report the debt on your credit report and tack on late payments or key derogatories in perpetuity...that part has nothing to do with a statute of limitations and is totally separate."

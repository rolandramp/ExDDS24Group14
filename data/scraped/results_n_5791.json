    "title": "What happens if Petitioner fails to appear for a default judgment prove-up hearing in a California divorce case?",
    "question": "When I started to work for my present employer I already filed a divorce so I reported my status to payroll as \"single, head of household\". My divorce is friendly (we just decided to go with the default to avoid paying another $435.00 filing fee for an answer ---we learned to late about summary dissolution option), no kids to our marriage, relatively short marriage (2yrs), no credit card debts, no community or quasi community assets, no income differences. The court set a default prove-up date and I, the petitioner, supposed to appear. It'd be really difficult for me to go as I do not want to risk to lose my new job and they don't even know about my pending divorce. What happens if I do not appear? Default judgment will still be entered? Thank you.",

        "As a general rule of thumb you should never ever miss a court hearing. There is a process where you can request the Court grant you a continuance if you are unable to attend the hearing. You should reference your County's local court rules, speak to the Court clerk, or visit the Family Law Facilitator at your court to determine the proper method of asking the Court to hear your default prove up on a different day.",
        "The default would not be entered without your appearance at the prove up hearing. However, you and your soon to be ex, can simply reach a written agreement on all issues and this along with the proper Judgment paperwork can be submitted for a default judgment without you or he having to make an appearance.",
        "No. If you fail to attend the default prove-up hearing, the matter will go off-calendar, and you will have to file to set another default prove-up hearing. If you can't take off from work, you might be better off dismissing that case and filing a joint Summary Dissolution with your spouse - there won't be any hearing required in a Summary Dissolution case, which will be far easier than a regular Dissolution case. Regarding your payroll status, you are still married, and you haven't indicated what facts would qualify you as a head of household, so you will likely have some additional income tax to pay at tax return time unless your divorce has been completed before the end of the year and you qualify as a head of household."

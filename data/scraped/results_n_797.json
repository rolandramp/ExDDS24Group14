    "question": "I was recently notified that medical debt, that I owe, was provided to a collection agency. The agency is telling me that if I dispute that debt they will send me written verification, or a copy of a judgement. However, I am not aware of any court action being taken against me. Could this judgement have gone through with out me knowing.",

        "Yes, a judgment can be entered against you without you knowing about it. Unfortunately this happens to many individuals. One way to find out if there is a lawsuit against you is to search court cases online. You should be able to look at the Superior Court Of California - Orange County website and search cases using your name. If you lived in other counties previously then you may want to do an online case search for each of those counties. I hope this helps. Best of luck!",
        "My guess is you are reading too much into a boadly worded form letter. It is always a good idea to check your credit report regularly and see if there are any public records at the end of the report. Or check with the records for the local courts for your name. Hope this perspective helps!",
        "Yes, a judgment could possibly be entered without you knowing. For example, in situations where the creditor attempts to serve the lawsuit at a prior address of the debtor, then the debtor might not become of aware of the legal action, while the creditor is under the assumption that they served to a proper address. However, there is standard dispute language included on most dunning letters that generally state that if a judgment has been entered, a copy of that judgment will be provided to the debtor if they dispute the debt. Even if a collection letter includes this language, it does not necessarily mean that a judgment has been entered."

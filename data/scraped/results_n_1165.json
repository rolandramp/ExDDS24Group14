This is a very, very simplified summary and a bankruptcy lawyer, or perhaps a more specific question listing the debts you are concerned about, may help answer your inquiry better. Also, please note that a chapter 13 case is for individuals only, so if you're looking to reorganize your business you would need to consider filing a chapter 11 case which is more complex and costly. Good luck!!",

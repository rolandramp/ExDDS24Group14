    "title": "Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA). Statute of limitations in California",
    "question": "There are 2 collection agencies that are incorrectly reporting information on my credit report which is negatively affecting my credit score. I know I have recourse under the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA). I was told that generally these cases are fee shifting which means that I should not have to forward any attorney fees; my attorney will receive their payment from the offending party. Furthermore, if successful, I may be entitled to up to $1,000.00 dollars in statutory damages and/ or actual damages. My attorney said I would just have to cover the \"hard cost\" (ex: costs to file necessary paperwork with the courts, transportation expenses such as lodging, gas to drive from So. Cal to Fresno, CA if necessary). Any help will be appreciated.",

        "I read your post twice, but did not see a question. I believe you have confused the statute of limitations with the length of time derogatory information may be reported by a credit reporting agency.\n\nAccurate negative information, such as late payments, will be reported for up to 7 years from the original delinquency date. The original delinquency date is the date the payment was first reported late. So, if you miss a payment today, it will be deleted on this date seven years from now.\n\nThere is nothing in your post which suggests the derogatory information which is being reported is more than 7 years old or that the reporting agency has done anything unlawful.",

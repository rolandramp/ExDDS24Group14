    "title": "Just found out child's father filed for bankruptcy, he owes me $150,000 in child support!",
    "question": "Father is doctor, he ran up $150,000 arrearage(his lawyer and him know the local judge) He concealed his BK from me so I couldn't inquire about his income (local judge denied any discovery to me). He also didn't want me telling trustee about his income/assets he is hiding. It's still open, I filed a proof of priority claim, but can I ask the BK judge to set a payment plan for the c/s? Trustee didn't do a good job of reviewing his claims. I just don't know how he was able to file hiding all his income, all the lawyers knew he owed $150,000 in c/s. Why was I not notified? Plus he only stated 3 creditors, he owes so many people money. Will the bk judge let me have a creditors meeting at this late time and make him pay the arrearage? Will he get in trouble for lying about his inc/assets?",

        "What the other attorneys have stated about the bankruptcy not wiping out the child support debt to you is correct. However, there is a provision in the bankruptcy laws that were enacted in 2005 that says the Bankruptcy Trustee can reach all assets, even exempt assets for the purpose of collecting back support. In 9 years I have never seen this used to make the trustee pursue the debtor but it can be done. I would have to look up the relevant section but it is there.\n\nYes you can try to get him denied a discharge as the attorney's have stated. However, as a practical matter, that may not be in your best interest. The reason I am saying that is that the discharge will wipe out the other creditors so they are not competing with your attempts to collect the debt. Why would you want to be fighting with other creditors for the same money.\n\nI would look into what you can get the Bankruptcy trustee to do to aid collection. I would also ask the District Attorney Family Support Division to help collect the support arrears and ongoing support payments. A family court order is still an order and can be enforced by the DA.\n\nIf you know of assets that are PROVABLE, then the trustee can and will go after them. The Trustee however is not going to fight this battle if you cannot prove that there is assets to go after so they can get paid.

If there are assets that are reachable, the Trustee is going to try to collect as that is the only cases he will get paid a decent amount for handling.\n\nThe other attorneys are correct in telling you that the individual running the Creditor's Meeting is a Trustee or representative of the Trustee.

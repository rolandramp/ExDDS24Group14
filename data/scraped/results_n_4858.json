    "title": "What should I expect in a Status Conference in a Chapter 7 adversary hearing?",
    "question": "My ex filed for an Adversary hearing against me in which we are both represented Pro Se. She is the Plaintiff/Creditor from a debt awarded to her in Family Court. I filed my response and served her but am confused as to what to expect in the Status Conference. It seems as if its mostly discovery (Witness lists, evidence etc) but I am curious what else to expect.",

        "Judges tend to approach these differently, so it really depends on the judge. The judge might discuss the status of discovery, ask if you want to go to mediation or set dates like the trial and discovery cut off. More often than not, the judge might set a continued hearing to monitor the case progress.\n\nI recommend hiring an attorney because an experienced attorney might be familiar with the judge and know his or her expectations. Or you might call the judges clerk or check the court's website for additional guidance."

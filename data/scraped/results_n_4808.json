        "Usually it's 4 years (if based on a written agreement) from the date of the default or the last payment. That's the time they have to collect. If that limit applies and it's beyond the limit, then they cannot collect. But they can continue to report negatively on credit reports for up to 7 years. So even though it may not be collectible, they can still report it if it's still within 7 years.",
        "The Statute of Limitations starts on the date of default, which may be 30 days after he made his last payment. If you make any payment now, the Statute of Limitations will start all over again.\n\nIs there a collection agency which is actively pursuing this account at this time?\n\nThe Statute of Limitations relates to the ability of the creditor / collector to bring a lawsuit. Credit reporting is a separate issue - the account can be reported for 7 1/2 years. However, a recent \"paid collection\" may be worse on your credit than an old, unpaid account. So, paying the account off now could actually hurt your credit. If you negotiate with a debt collector, get evidence that the collector is entitled to collect on the account. Then, check your credit and see whether the account is being reported by the original creditor or by the debt collector. You might try to negotiate an agreement, confirmed in writing by an authorized officer, that the reporting creditor will report the account as \"delete tradeline\", which will remove it from your credit."

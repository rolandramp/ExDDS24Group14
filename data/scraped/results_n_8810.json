    "title": "Can I sue for wrongfully ruining my credit score?",
    "question": "I was contacted by a collections agency regarding a medical bill from a doctor I went to 4 months ago claiming it was not paid. I was never notified by the doctor that we owed anything. Come to find out after researching my check register I did pay it. I printed out a copy of the original cashed check from the bank website. I then contacted the doctorâ€™s office and gave them the check number the day they cashed it and the bank they used. I was told they would fix it that was three weeks ago. I just received a call from a collection agency saying I owed the same debit and now I have negative points on my credit score which was 760! What legal action do I have since my perfect credit that I have maintained all my life is now ruined?",

        "You should immediately send by certified mail to the debt collector and to the physician's office my sample letter 1.1 (see link, below) disputing this debt and providing a copy of the check that you used to pay the bill in full. Also, note in your letter that you are enclosing the check copy and that you spoke with ABC at the doctor's office on the date (three weeks ago) and he or she said that they would take care of this. You should make it clear in your letter that this must be immediately removed from your credit reports. Give them 15 days from date of receipt. This will properly assert your rights under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act.\n\nIf you don't get a response in 15 days that they have resolved this to your satisfaction, then to correct this on your credit, you should send sample letter #3.1 to the credit reporting agencies disputing this on your credit reports, also by certified mail, and provide a copy of the letter you sent to the doctor's office and debt collector with proof of payment in full. This will assert your rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act.\n\nIf the item remains on your credit reports when the credit reporting agencies respond to your dispute letter and documentation, then you need an experienced lawyer to sue them for violations of both these acts, which provides for damages, costs, and attorney's fees. I have handled a number of these medical billing cases and it is a sorry state of affairs that medical offices are so quick to assign debts to debt collectors and don't bother to contact the patient first.",

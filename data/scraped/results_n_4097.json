        "It depends. If she were to die within 180 days after your case is filed, any inheritance you might receive is considered estate property. After that, the rules vary from court to court. Check with your bankruptcy attorney to find out.\n\nYour grandmother can change her estate plan to protect your inheritance from being subject to this, however. She needs to speak with an estate attorney about a \"spendthrift trust\".",
        "Discuss this with your Ch 13 attorney. If you inherit anything within 180 days after you file, there is no question that it is part of the Ch 13. If you inherit after 180 days of filing, the consequences depend on your local jurisdiction, so see your attorney.",
        "You will need to inform your attorney if you inherit money while in bankruptcy. The trustee could take a position that the funds are property of the bankruptcy estate and require you to pay the funds into your plan. Often this depends on the trustee that is administering your case. If you have a sense of what you might inherit, you might be able to exempt all or some of it as a potential asset. There are other possible solutions, as well, such as a non revocable spend-thrift trust, or asking your grandmother to not leave you anything. You should consult your attorney and ask he or she to explain all of your options.",
        "This post from my blog should answer your question: \"Inheritance and Bankruptcy\" at http://mrdaymude.com/inheritance-and-bankruptcy/. If you file a 13, as opposed to a 7, as long as the case is open any inheritance will properly belong to the trustee. Perhaps you should have a conversation with your grandmother.",
        "Mr. Brewer has answered your question correctly. The inheritance is property of the bankruptcy estate and you would need to tell your attorney about it.",
        "I want to know what it takes to live to be 100. But to answer your question , your attorney must know about any potential inheritance. When you file to reorganize your debts, you are committing everything to pay back your lawfully incurred debts. This includes future wages, inheritance income, whatever. So full disclosure is the norm."

    "title": "Do I owe income tax on rental properties included in a Chapter 7 Bankruptcy?",
    "question": "I was advised by the bankruptcy attorney I hired that if I included my properties in the Chapter 7 that I would be protected from having to pay income tax on amount of the debt. I filed in 2009 and I received several 1099's from a several of the lenders this year, I had numerous properties. My tax preparer said that my bankruptcy attorney's office should have handled the 1099's that were sent to their office. Instead my attorney forwarded them to me,and my bankruptcy attorney's office is NOW saying that I AM responsible to pay taxes on the amount, which was the loan amount. If this is true, then I don't understand the purpose of including them in a bankruptcy, if I just let them foreclose then I would have been in the same situation. I don't even have enough money to pay my rent right now.",

        "You probably need a tax preparer who is a professional such as a CPA or IRS enrolled agent. This issue of cancellation of debt income (1099-C) might be too complicated for most tax preparers. Because of the bankruptcy you do not have to pay income taxes on cancllation of debt income. A Form 982 needs to be filed stating that you filed a case under Title 11 which is where the Bankruptcy Code can be found. You still have to pay taxes on the net income from rental property and may have to pay capital gain taxes in your income tax return even if you lost money because you may have taken depreciation on rental real estate. Make sure you hire the right person for preparation of your tax return. The lawyer handling your bankruptcy case does not handle any tax issues that arise in connection with the bankruptcy case or a short sale or a foreclosure. Bankruptcy lawyers are not tax lawyers generally. Therefore, you need to consult with a tax lawyer, CPA or IRS enrolled agent for tax-related issues.",
        "Not a problem. File a form 982 with your tax return and a copy of it for state purposes and check box 1a. Complete the form.",
        "You are responsible for paying income taxes on income you received from rental properties (less your allowable expenses),\n\nYou are not responsible for paying income taxes due to a \"forgiveness of debt.\" Check out the IRS website for additional information on this topic on the link below.\n\nHope this perspective helps!",
        "The tax is the forgiven debt in the event you surrender the property. They must be included in the bankruptcy, but it is up to you to surrender or retain."

        "The bankruptcy doesn't act to seal or remove any valid records. However, in my experience over the past 34 years, I have found that once a client gets a discharge of debt in their bankruptcy, future landlords will look less toward the past and more toward the future and my clients increased ability to make make their rent payments.\n\nYou need to make sure that the prospective landlord is aware that you discharged the debt of your ex in your bankruptcy. Discussing it rather than having it discovered, depending on what they are checking, may help.\n\nMost complete credit reports will show judgments for between 7 and 10 years. After that you shouldn't have this issue.",
        "The Fair Credit Reporting Act allows you to submit a brief explanation about any item on your consumer credit report. However, few rental companies make decisions based on the consumer report, and fewer still bother to read explanations. Maybe your spouse alone should apply for the lease or you can offer a larger deposit. No help for this in bankruptcy. Hope this perspective helps.",
        "If there was a money judgment in the eviction case, it should have been treated as any other state court judgment when you filed your Chapter 7 case. A motion to avoid the judicial lien should have been filed in the bankruptcy court, and the judgment lien could have been avoided, through an order entered by the bankruptcy judge. Did this happen in your case? You can find out, by accessing your case docket on PACER. If you or your attorney did not file the appropriate motion to avoid your judicial lien years ago, there is no way to do this now. Your Chapter 7 case is over, and you have already received your discharge.",

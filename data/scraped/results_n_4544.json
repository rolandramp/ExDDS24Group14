        "You're in LA, there is self help in the downtown courthouse as well as the Van Nuys Courthouse. San Fernando as well I believe. Levitt & Quinn offers pro-rated (based on income) services. Don't know their intake process however. Often the pro bono services have a longer intake. If you cannot afford a lawyer I would suggest trying self-help and/or Levitt & Quinn first. There are many moving parts to your question and it would require a review of the entire file. Or at least more than what you have provided as it is also a bit confusing. You will have to supply current pay stubs. I do not know a reason why you wouldn't unless you have an updated Income and Expense Declaration (within the last three months). Can she take your cars? I don't know. Payments may be an option to put the matter to rest, but again it's a bit of a confusing question. Try self-help or work something out with your lawyer on a payment plan (if possible)."

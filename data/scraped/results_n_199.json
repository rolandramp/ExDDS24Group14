    "title": "What should I do if creditor that wasn't listed on no asset case starts to garnish wages?",
    "question": "In 2018 I filed a chapter 7 bankruptcy in California, which was a no asset case. In 2019 an agency decided to charge fees for a service provided from 2016-2018. Since I had no knowledge of this until 2019 it was not listed on the bankruptcy forms. I talked to an attorney briefly in March, who said that since it was a no asset case, that I could file some paperwork to get them to stop collection attempts. However since covid started I have not been able to reach the attorney. At this point I'm not sure what I should file, and what paperwork, if any, I might need to show it was a no asset case. So my question is, should I stop this collection attempt? If so, what do I need to file with the courts? And, what paperwork, if any, could I obtain from the court to prove it was a no asset case?",

        "If the debt which you reference is a dischargeable debt (i.e. it is not subject to one of the exceptions to discharge set forth in 11 USC 523), then it was discharged despite your failure to list them or provide notice of the bankruptcy case. Any attempts they are making to collect are violations of the post discharge injunction of 11 U.S.C. 524.\n\nYou should inform them of the bankruptcy filing and discharge and tell them that any further collection attempts (including sending billing notices) could subject them to contempt of court sanctions.\n\nIf they refuse to stop, you will need to file an action in the bankruptcy court for violation of the discharge injunction. I would suggest hiring a bankruptcy attorney for the above.",
        "I agree with the opinions above about sending the discharge. I will add to be sure to seek a refund of any sums seized. Since the garnishment is legally void, you should have your money returned.",
        "Send your discharge to the creditor and to the garnishing officer/ sheriff. If that isn’t enough to stop the wage garnishment collection, hire a lawyer to protect your rights, notifying the unlisted creditor about the bankruptcy discharge and unlawful creditor collection activity.",
        "What does your lawyer say? No lawyer? Send the creditor, court which issued the judgment and sheriff who notified you of the garnishment a copy of your BK Discharge. That should do it. Also, the sheriff will stop all future garnishments for this debt and return any money withheld. If this is too complicated, find/consult/hire a lawyer in your area using the Avvo feature \"Find a Lawyer\". Make a list of 4-5 having many 5 star reviews from satisfied clients. If you don't get a prompt call back from one, go on to the next on your list. Some offer a free consultation by phone or in person. Take us up on it.",
        "You are hung up on “a no asset case” which is irrelevant. You need to focus on providing the creditor with your Discharge. Send them a copy. ASAP"

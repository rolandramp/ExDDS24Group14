        "Consult with a bankruptcy immediately. Most offer a free consultation and some will even consult with you over the phone.",
        "Your question has several \"moving parts\" involving a \"cross-over\" between bankruptcy and permissible exemptions. This site lacks the \"back and forth\" you get from a live consultation with a lawyer. One answered question leads to the next, etc, etc. As said by my colleagues, you need to find/consult/hire a lawyer using the Avvo feature \"Find a Lawyer\". Make a list of 4-5 having many 5 star reviews from satisfied clients. If you don't get a prompt call back from one, go on to the next on your list. Some of us offer a free consultation by phone or in person. Take us up on it.\n\nThat said, if your BF filed his case without a lawyer, he made a big mistake. If he had a lawyer, he should be asking these questions to his lawyer.",
        "If all of these cars were in your boyfriend's name then they all technically belong to your boyfriend and became part of his bankruptcy estate when he filed bankruptcy. The trustee can sell all property that is part of the bankruptcy estate that is not protected under the California exemptions. It is impossible to tell what exemptions your boyfriend used and whether the trustee was correct in acting how he did without reviewing the paperwork. Did your boyfriend have an attorney? If not, I recommend he consult with one right away. Hope this helps.",
        "Bankruptcy can be a complex process. I would suggest your boyfriend consult and hire a bankruptcy attorney ASAP. Bankruptcy is not really a DIY project. Trustees generally look for assets that are not protected by the bankruptcy laws and sell those assets for the benefit of the debtor's creditors. However, I suggest you schedule a consultation with an experienced bankruptcy attorney so your boyfriend knows his options."

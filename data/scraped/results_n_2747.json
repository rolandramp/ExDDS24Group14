    "title": "What is the statue of limitations for a TRAFFIC ticket in CA, that has gone into collections?",
    "question": "I JUST received a letter, (Dec., 2014) from a collection agency...stating that I \"failed to appear\" in court (Pasadena) for a traffic violation, back in 2009, for fees over $700. First, I don't remember ever \"failing to appear\", as in the few times in my whole entire driving life (30 years) I've only received a few traffic violations and went to court immediately. I just renewed my D/L last year....wouldn't there have been a DMV hold, if I owed money? Why am I JUST hearing about this \"non appearance\"? What are my rights?",

        "No SOL to protect you.\nGo to courthouse and review the ticket. Request appearance before judge. Explain circumstances. Judge has authority to correct any mistakes and may reduce or eliminate any fines and penalties.",
        "You can go to the courthouse, pull the ticket and ask the traffic clerk to see a judge (who will most of the time at least reduce the amount). If you don't want to do that, there are a number of traffic attorneys that will go to court for you from $199.00 to 299.00. If they get the ticket knocked down to $100.00 for example, you'll be ahead and you wont have gone to court.",
        "Your first stop should be the courthouse. Ask to see the citation and the other records in the court file. What you do next depends upon what you find.\n\nThe Statute of Limitations does no apply if the case was filed within the statute.",
        "Are you saying that you have no knowledge of this alleged ticket? If so, it may be a mistake and they are trying to collect money from you that you really do not owe. Maybe they are going after the wrong person. You should dispute the debt in writing and ask for a verification of the debt. At the same time, you should find out whether you have ever received a traffic ticket in 2009. You can always consult with an attorney."

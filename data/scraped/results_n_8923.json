    "question": "We have no equity in anything except our personal vehicle & our work truck. Each have a value of about 15,000 and nothing owed on them. We owe more on our home than what it's worth, we have a travel trailer with a lien slightly less that what is owed & that is all we have, except alot of debt, credit cards and taxes. We just want to keep our vehicles & will give up our home.",

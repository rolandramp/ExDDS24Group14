    "title": "Can I go back to family court to have a stay of an award lifted?",
    "question": "I received an award against my ex in family court in Jan 2016. The award was stayed due to him filing BK in Aug 2015. June 2016 he received an order of discharge from the BK court. I had filed (can't remember the date) to include my award from Family Court in with the BK to try and get the estate to pay me. Nowhere in the list of creditors at the time of his discharge am I listed. There is no money to pay ANY creditors. BUT: after an adversarial proceeding with his BK, I AM listed as the Number 1 creditr to be paid and then Number 2 was the IRS. So at some point my paperwork was received by the BK court but not at the time of the discharge. Can I go back now to Family Court and pursue the award? File a motion to have the stay lifted and him forced to pay?",

        "When he received his discharge, the automatic stay was lifted (unless the court extended it for some reason).\nAssuming your award was deemed non-dischargeable in your Adversary Proceeding, you are free to pursue it - no motion for relief is required."

The plaintiff will obtain a judgment without the court hearing from you.\n\nIf you file proper responsive papers, the court will schedule a Status Conference and encourage both sides to try to settle. If the case does not settle, the court will, at that time, set a trial date.\n\nYou should consult a lawyer now.

        "Do I need probate if the assets left behind are worth less than $150,000?\n\nSmall Estate Procedures\n\nCalifornia offers two procedures for transferring assets when the total value of an estate is less than $150,000. The first procedure is the easiest and requires no Probate Court involvement. The Second is a simplified and expedited procedure which cuts out many of the complexities of a full probate but at the cost of some of probate’s protections.\n\nSmall Estate Collection Affidavit\n\nCalifornia recently updated their small estate collection affidavit law to allow families to collect distribute the assets of individuals who died owning no real property and other assets otherwise subject to probate totaling $150,000 or less to be collected and distributed without probate.\nThe Small Estate Collection Affidavit Process only works when there is no real property which must be transferred by means other than operation of law (various rights of survivorship).\nSteps in using the Small Estate Collection Affidavit process:\nFirst, confirm that the value of the property which needs to be transferred is worth $150,000 or less. We recommend that you create a spreadsheet or table and list:\nAll assets, including the estate’s receivables such as life insurance and retirement benefits, that will be paid to the estate. Do not include insurance or retirement plan benefits which are specifically payable to or for the benefit of specific individuals. Do not include:\n1) Vehicles (Cars, boats and mobile homes);\n2) Property held in trust, including a living trust.\n3) Personal property that the person who died owned with someone else (joint tenancy).\n4) Bank accounts which are designated to transfer their balance to one or more named individuals when the account’s primary owner has passed.\n5) Property (community, quasi-community, or separate) that passed directly to the surviving spouse or domestic partner.\n6) Life insurance, death benefits or other assets not subject to probate that pass directly to the beneficiaries.\n7) Unpaid salary or other compensation up to $5,000 owed to the person who died.\n\nRemember you may not deduct debts from the sum value of your family member’s assets. The Collection Affidavit provision is based upon gross value. If the total value of these assets is $150,000 or less and at least 40 days have passed since the death, you can transfer the remaining decedent’s personal property by writing an affidavit following the guidelines of PC 13100. Many California banks and financial institutions have copies of a form which follows these guidelines. Most estate planning attorneys can also prepare one for you.\n\nSmall Value Real Property\n\nCalifornia also recently updated its process for petitioning to determine the succession of real property when the property involved is worth less than $150,000.\n\nIf the person left $150,000 or less in real property, including some personal property, you may be able to use a form called Petition to Determine Succession to Real Property (Estates $150,000 or Less) (Form DE-310). Under this small estate process we file a Petition with the court, obtain and file an Inventory and Appraisal (Form DE-160), and provide notice of hearing. If all goes well, the court will order the transfer of the property at that hearing. Depending upon where the decedent lived in California, this expedited process ordinarily takes two to six months. Call to set an appointment. At that appointment we will help you determine whether this procedure can be used to help you more quickly get assets distributed after a death.\n\nhttp://wealthpreservationattorneys.com/san-diego-california-probate--estate-administration-lawyer_pa8293.htm",

        "Student loan debt belongs to student for BK liability analysis. Remains separate property debt after marriage. Marriage does not subject non-student to liability for the debt.",
        "Any creditor can go after community property, even if it is a premarital debt.",
        "School loans incurred prior o marriage belong to the student. Further, if (sorry to put a damper on the coming marriage) you subsequently get divorced, the student loans will follow the spouse who went to school on the theory that the spouse gets all the future benefit of the education.",
        "Depends on whether he took out the loan before or after you were married. You should be discussing your concerns with the attorney you retain to prepare your pre-nuptial agreement. Hope this perspective helps!",
        "Student loan debt belongs to the student. The marital status does not change that. So long as you do not co-sign on any student loan debt, private student loans, then you will not be responsible. That being said, the household income does come into play with certain Federal Student Loan Repayment Options. Seek the advice of an independent California Student Loan Lawyer to discuss details."

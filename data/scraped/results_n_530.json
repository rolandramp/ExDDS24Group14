    "title": "Can you file CH 7 bankruptcy on personal loan from friend with promissory note & they paid a student loan with a credit card?",
    "question": "First it was a gift to pay off my student loan and after they paid it with their credit card they changed their minds and wanted me to pay it back. There is a promissory note for this as well that was after this person already paid it. Can I include this in my chapter 7 bankruptcy since this person used their credit card to pay my student loan or can this person use the same shoes as a student loan creditor and fight me on it? Because I know you can't file bankruptcy on a student loan.",
    "answers": [
        "The law is that loans taken to pay student loans are still considered student loans. However, as the others have pointed out, unless the documentation for this loan is pretty clear regarding the purpose, your friend will have a difficult time proving his loan was solely for the purpose of paying off your student loan and that he stands in the shoes of the former student loan creditor.",
        "I think you will be ok once you file for bk and get your discharge. That being said, if your friend does raise an issue, you need to chat with an attorney who specializes in Student loan and bankruptcy law.",
        "I agree with my colleagues ... the debt to your friend will be discharged.",
        "You have a contract with your friend and not the student loan creditor to repay your friend for paying off your student loan. Your personal liability on the contract is a dischargeable debt that can be included in bankruptcy absent fraud. Your friend can try to claim he is a student loan creditor and claim the debt owed him should be non dischargeable but he would be unsuccessful. You should contact a bankruptcy attorney to help guide you through the process.",
        "The person who paid your student loan with a credit card is going to have a very tough time claiming that their loan to you was a \"student loan\" and, is therefore, not dischargeable. Their loan to you was just that, a personal loan, evidenced by the promissory note you signed. You can include their promissory note in your Chapter 7 and it will be discharged along with your other unsecured debts."

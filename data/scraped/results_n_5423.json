    "title": "How should the \"in Attachment 5b\" be prepared under section 5b of FL-100 (Petition-Marriage)? Is a spreadsheet adequate?",
    "question": "Form FL-100, section 5b, provides for the listing of assets and debts in 3 ways: 1) on the form itself, 2) FL-160, or 3) as an Attachment 5b. My assets and debt will not fit on the FL-100 or FL-160 when trying to type them into the document. If a spreadsheet is acceptable, what other information needs to be included (the same info as included in FL-160)?",

        "I agree with Mr. Dwyer.\n\nIn fact, the *only* time I generally list assets on this form are when I anticipate that I will take the Respondent's default.",
        "You can incorporate a spreadsheet if you wish. Many - who wish to have their assets immune from public scrutiny - will simply put \"to be determined.\" Note that your Schedule of Assets and Debts does not have to be filed with the Court. Rather, you are only required to file a Proof of Service for your Declarations of Disclosure. Listing your assets and debts in your petition for dissolution unnecessarily IMO diminishes your privacy."

    "title": "Is It Permissible To Write A Letter To A Probate Judge In California?",
    "question": "I am executor and sole beneficiary. Assets consist of only 1 home and 1 car. Debts are under $5K. The will was not contested. What should be an easy probate has now turned into a nightmare of costly setbacks to me personally and now I do not have enough money to pay future mortgages. The home was ready to close escrow when another 45-60 day setback occurred. I believe my attorney is not acting in my best interest and has not given sound advice. Additionally, he has never copied me in on filings, fails to answer many of my emailed questions, failed to implement certain process and my realtor and escrow rep say he has not acted in my best interest and is very difficult to deal with. I asked my attorney to explain my situation, but he refused. Am I permitted to write the judge?",
    "answers": [
        "No you can't write a letter to the judge. You have the right to relieve your attorney of duties, retrieve your full file now and go and hire a new attorney. He does have a right to be paid for his time, but this would also be subject to your attorney client agreement. You can mediate this later and you can dispute his claim for compensation. But, I suggest that you seek help of another attorney right away. It sounds like the one you hired is not an experienced probate attorney.",
        "The other attorneys are correct. Writing the judge will do no good - get a new attorney before it gets any worse.",
        "Judges often get letters from various people complaining about lawyers. They have heard it all. But they will not act sua sponte (on their own, without some sort of petition or motion). The previous response is probably your best course. Find a competent lawyer in the county where this is taking place and have them review the file. You can, depending upon what they learn, terminate your existing lawyer and retain the new one. The lawyers will then have to divide the statutory fee based on work performed. It may be that the existing lawyer has some benign reason (like the wrong address, phone number or email, or all of the above) for not communicating with you. However, based on the inference one can draw from your facts, it appears that you may need to evaluate whether the lawyer is the right choice for you. It is the client's responsibility to choose the right lawyer. This can often come back to bite executors and trustees, because they want to hire the guy at church, or their neighbor, who claims they handle these types of cases. There is a reason that the State Bar designates specialists in this area. It is very specialized.",
        "It is not proper to contact the court by letter to the judge. It is an ex parte communication that is inappropriate. Sometimes judges will overlook that when someone is in pro per (representing themselves). That said, the judge wouldnt counsel you on legal issues.

In addition, the conduct, if true, sounds very inappropriate and you should report the matter to the state bar.\n\nAgain, at this point, it sounds like you need a change of counsel immediately before you suffer any more harm.",
        "Rather than writing to the Judge which will not help you why don't you meet with an experienced probate attorney? They can review what's been done and indicate if the current attorney has acted properly or not. It is possible it's just the process but in a single bene estate it should be pretty simple.",
        "I agree with my colleagues. Writing a letter to a judge under these circumstances is likely only to get the judge upset and frustrated with you. You hired an attorney. HE is the person who is supposed to communicate with the court on your behalf. He also has the knowledge and the experience to know how best to present your issues to the court, as well as the proper procedure for doing so. If you have had a falling out with the attorney, your choices appear to be to patch things up with the attorney, (who appears to have been giving you a break), or find another attorney to assist you.\n\nJames Frederick"

        "Not likely arrested. Assuming the contractor was licensed, the police will most likely treat this as a civil dispute.\n\nWhen you have a dispute with a building contractor, the first question is whether the \"contractor\" is licensed. In California, it is illegal for an unlicensed person to perform contracting work on any project valued at $500 or more in labor and materials. California Business & Professions Code section 7031(a) prevents an unlicensed contractor from collecting on debts owed to them by consumers under contracts due to their unlicensed status. This means that a court will not enforce the illegal contract. Furthermore, California Business & Professions Code section 7031(b) gives consumers who have contracted with unlicensed contractors the ability to sue for restitution or reimbursement of all monies paid to the unlicensed contractor for \"any act or contract. In short, an unlicensed subcontractor will not only be unable to collect against the owner but may actually be liable to pay back to the owner every penny that was already paid him. This law applies even if the unlicensed contractor completes the job and even if the work performed is otherwise perfect.\n\nSecondly, you can make a complaint to the California Contractors State License Board (CSLB). Complaints within the CSLB's jurisdiction include failure of a licensed contractor to fulfill the terms of an agreement. Failures include poor workmanship; abandonment of a project; failure to pay subcontractors, material suppliers or employees; or building code violations. Other failures are lack of reasonable diligence in executing a construction project; use of false misleading or deceptive advertising. Violations of the law by a licensed contractor may result in a citation or charges against the contractor that could lead to suspension or revocation of the contractor's license.\n\nIn addition, you could make a claim on the contractor's bond. As a general rule, a building contractor must obtain and maintain a performance bond in the principal amount of $12,500 in order to do business in California. (Bus. & Prof. Code, § 7071.6(a).) As an alternative to a bond, the contractor's law allows a contractor to deposit cash in lieu of a bond with the Contractor's State License Board (\"CSLB\"). (Bus. & Prof. Code, § 7071.12.) The beneficiaries who are entitled to make a claim against the cash deposit include: \"A person damaged as a result of a willful and deliberate violation of this chapter by the licensee, or by the fraud of the licensee in the execution or performance of a construction contract.\" (Bus. & Prof. Code § 7071.10(c).) Wilful or deliberate failure by any licensee or agent or officer thereof, to pay any moneys, when due for any materials or services rendered in connection with his operations as a contractor, when he has the capacity to pay or when he has received sufficient funds therefor as payment for the particular construction work, project, or operation for which the services or materials were rendered or purchased constitutes a cause for disciplinary action. (Bus. & Prof. Code, § 7120.) The amount of the bond, or cash in lieu of a bond, recoverable by such beneficiaries is limited to $7,500.00. (Bus. & Prof. Code, § 7071.9(b).)\n\nFinally, you can sue in small claims court to recover damages of $7,500 or less. If you prevail in a civil or arbitration case against a licensed contractor, send CSLB documentation of the disposition of the case. CSLB will notify the contractor that the license will be suspended if the judgment or award is not satisfied."

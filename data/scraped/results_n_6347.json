    "answers": [
        "Absent any language contained in the trust itself, where the trust assets are in a condition to be distributed (all creditors and debts have been paid, assets have been sold etc.), there is no requirement that the trustee wait an additional 180 to distribute the property to the beneficiaries. Also, depending on the language of the trust, an accounting may not necessarily be required prior to distribution of the trust. Of course, unless all the beneficiaries waive the accounting, a prudent trustee would provide an accounting as a matter of course. If a final accounting has been rendered, and the trust itself does not contain language calling for additional waiting time, then the assets should be distributed. If some assets have been sold but other assets still need to be sold before distribution, then a partial distribution should and could be made.\nYou also indicated in your notes to one of the attorney’s responses that the trustee offered to “lend” you funds via an early distribution at a certain interest rate. This is probably not appropriate unless such language was included in the trust. You may want to have an attorney review the trust and the accounting (if or when received). I’m located in San Diego and would be happy to answer any further questions you might have.",
        "Are you asking about 180 days from the date of death or 180 days from receiving the final account? Normally, in Michigan at least, the funds are distributed at or around the same time as the final account. It does not make a lot of sense to wait 180 days after the final account, because a lot can change in 6 months. That would then require an additional accounting to detail all the differences from the prior accounting, (thereby rendering the prior accounting anything but final.)\n\nJames Frederick",
        "It depends. In all liklihood, the Trustee could make an immeidate distribution but is not required to do so.",
        "It depends. To answer your question you should ask the trustee. If your trustee has a reason to withhold distribution, you are entitled to that information."

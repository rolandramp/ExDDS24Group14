    "title": "When a motion for relief from the automatic stay needs to be filed? Is declaratory relief a must procedure to discharge a debt?",
    "question": "My debtor reopened his Ch7 no assets case to add my loan to be discharged. After the reopening has been granted. The debt has already been discharged ?or he needs to file a declaratory relief in order to get the debt discharged? After the case has been reopened, I assume the automatic stay has been in effect. Therefore, I filed a motion for relief from the automatic stay to terminate the stay. However, judge did not understand what I want to do? What did I do wrong? People cannot file a motion to lift the automatic stay in a Ch 7 case? or because it is a no assets case?",

        "Actually, in the interest of thoroughness, since you haven't stated what the basis of the debt this debtor owes to you is, if it is based on a domestic support obligation such as alimony or child support, then the debt was not discharged and you are free to pursue collections in state court notwithstanding the case being reopened or the discharge being entered.\n\nMark J. Markus, Attorney at Law\nhttp://www.bklaw.com/",
        "I'm not sure why you are re-posting the same question that has already been answered. If the debtor is in the 9th Circuit (California, Oregon, Washington, Alaska, Hawaii), and it was a no-asset case, the debt was already discharged. Period. End of story. You cannot proceed with a lawsuit in state court. See In re Nielsen, 383 F.3d 922 (9th Cir. 2004) and In re Beezley, 994 F.2d 1433 (9th Cir. 1993). It's not the automatic stay you'd need relief from, it's the post discharge injunction of 11 USC 524, and you don't get relief from that since it is a permanent injunction.\n\nIf, AND ONLY IF, you have grounds to object to the discharge of the debt pursuant to 11 USC 523 (such as fraud, willful and malicious injury, theft, etc.) then you can petition the court to reopen the case and seek permission to file a lawsuit in the bankruptcy court objecting to the discharge of the debt, and then--if the court allows it--file a complaint and litigate through trial in the bankruptcy court.\n\nMark J.

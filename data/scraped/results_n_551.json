        "I am very sorry to hear about your situation. Bankruptcy may be a viable option for you. It is not clear whether the $27,000 owed is a student loan or something else? If it is a student loan you may qualify for extreme hardship and be able to get the student loan discharged. I recommend speaking to some experienced bankruptcy attorneys directly about your situation. Most of us give free consultations. I am not sure why you would be over the Medi-Cal limit given your financial situation. I would also contact your landlord and speak with them about catching up on your rent if you do not have alternative housing options.",
        "Consult with a bankruptcy attorney in your area. Most offer a free consultation. Take advantage of it and see if there may be viable solutions for you.",
        "I am very sorry that you are having so many hardships. Perhaps you can locate some subsidized senior citizen housing, and perhaps your county department of social services has programs that can help you.",
        "If you are being evicted, you should immediately contact a landlord-tenant attorney who can help you determine if you have any defenses to the Unlawful Detainer (eviction) case. If you consult with a landlord-tenant attorney but cannot afford to pay attorney's fees, contact a legal aid office in your area that helps low-income tenants. You might also look for legal aid services that are available to low-income seniors.\n\nAs far as the other debts are concerned, some of them (medical bills, utility bills, credit cards, loans which are not student loans) can be discharged in a bankruptcy case. Student loans are not discharged in a typical bankruptcy case, so the answer for man people is to apply for a forbearance or to be placed in an income-based repayment plan. AFTER you have contacted a landlord-tenant attorney, you may want to contact a bankruptcy attorney to consider whether bankruptcy would be helpful at this point in time.\n\nIf you do not file for bankruptcy, you would need to communicate with the medical providers or their debt collection agents to let them know that you do not currently have the ability to pay the amounts that have been billed to you."

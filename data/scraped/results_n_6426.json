    "title": "Does a Chapter 13 restart the statute of limitations on credit card debt since it involves agreeing to pay the debt",
    "question": "Filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy which included repayment on credit card debt that was passed the statute of limitations in California. I could no longer make the planned payment after 2 years due to job loss and the Trustee has dismissed the case.",
    "answers": [
        "Generally, once a debt is not collectible because of the statute of limitations a Debtor filing for Chapter 13 will not resurrect the viability of the debt. While it makes sense to list the creditor for notice purposes, the amount of the debt should have been listed as ZERO. If a claim was filed, there should have been an objection filed.\n\nThe short of it is - the debt is no longer collectible.\n\nI hope this helps.\nRespectfully,\nSteven A. Leahy\nwww.chicagotaxteam.com",
        "In general filing a bankruptcy case does not restart the statute of limitations on a debt. However, because the Automatic stay 11 U.S.C. 362(a) does act to stop any creditor’s ability to attempt to collect the debt or prosecute the matter, the bankruptcy will toll the statute of limitations on a debt.\n\nIn your case, since you could no longer afford your chapter 13 payments and your case was dismissed for what sounds like failure to fund the plan, you may still be able to file a Chapter 7 case, but depending on the time frame, the automatic stay may be an issue. I would suggest you consult with an experienced bankruptcy attorney in California who offers free initial consultations to at least get an idea if you can discharge your debt and also how to handle a possible affirmative defense against this creditor.",
        "Well I am confused. How would filing Chapter 13 mean that you agreed to resume paying the debt which was no longer legally enforceable? Why didn't you just list the debt as \"disputed\" and if the creditor filed a claim, file an objection to the proof of claim based on the SOL?\n\nHope this perspective helps!"

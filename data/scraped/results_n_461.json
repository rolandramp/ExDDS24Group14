        "I agree with my colleagues. Money distributed to creditors in a bankruptcy case depends upon several factors, including whether the case is a chapter 7 or 13; the type of creditors (priority or general unsecured), amount of debt, and the costs of administrative expenses incurred by a chapter 7 Trustee (which have priority for payment) if it is a chapter 7 case.

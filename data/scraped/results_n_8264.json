    "question": "Finally got our 1st modified w/Wells Fargo but the 2nd (also WF) charged off almost simultaneously! Its now w/collection agency that is only interested in lump sum payoff. WF wants nothing to do with us since they charged off and ca refuses to let us make pymts! So whats next???? Keep getting different answers as to whether its now unsecured/secured! IF the ca attempts to seek a deficiency judgement are we to assume that it is then unsecured and could we file chpt.7 AND keep the home w/the mod we fought for nearly 2yrs to get? This was a \"Smart Fit EQ Loan\" of $159k. We only owe $84k on 1st and home value is prob. about $140k so theres around $56k in equity the 2nd could've got through foreclosure which has us wondering why they chose to charge off? The waiting and wondering is killing us",

        "A charge or write off is an accounting entry to get your loan off the bank's books. It does not mean you do not owe it. It is a secured debt because it is a lien on your home. The lien is the deed of trust and it will never expire. The owner of the promissory note (whoever owns it now!) can wait until the house goes up in value and you pay down the first and then foreclose. That debt will continue to go up over the years. Chapter 7 will not affect in any manner the lien on your house related to the second or junior deed of trust. You do not have to worry about a deficiency since the second would have to foreclose and would do it by trustee's sale. No deficiencies when sale by non-judicial foreclosure. Deficiency liability which is personal liability is dischargeable in Chapter 7 but that is not something you need to worry about in your situation. There isn't anything you can do. If the second tries to foreclose you can file a Chapter 13 and stop the sale but you will have to pay what has not been paid on the second loan over a maximum 5 year period in a Chapter 13 Plan. In the meantime continue to try to have the collection agency accept a modification. Document your efforts in case you need to litigate the case or file bankruptcy. Good luck."

    "title": "As trustee of my mom's trust, can I sell her house in order to pay my sister's Deed of Trust?",
    "question": "My sister had my Mom sign a Deed of Trust against her house when she was dying and did not know what she was doing. Now my sister wants the Deed of Trust to be paid. I hired an attorney to review my sister's Settlement Agreement, and now he sends me a bill for $8600. I have NO money and was forced into this because I am the Trustee. The trust provides that attorney's fees will be paid from the trust assets. The only asset is my Mom's house. Can I just sell it and have the attorney and my sister paid off that way or do I have to sign the house over to her in this proposed Settlement Agreement. The sale of the house is the only means by which I can pay this attorney.",

        "You should consult with your attorney, or a new attorney if you are not satisfied with your present counsel. Generally, trust assets are available to pay the expenses associated with administering a trust, including the legal fees incurred by the trustee. Trust assets are also generally available to pay debts owed by the grantor. It's not clear what the terms of the settlement agreement are, but the context suggests that there was a dispute over the validity of the deed of trust, which has now been resolved by agreement. The terms of that agreement should control. There may be ways to tap into the equity of the home, without selling it, in order to pay the legitimate debts and expenses. Your first step, however, should be discussing this with your attorney.",
        "Impossible to answer question without knowing additional facts and seeing the settlement agreement.\nYou may/not have authority to sell the house. May not be in best interest to sell the house. Other less drastic solutions may be available to you.\nReview all relevant facts and settlement agreement with trust counsel.",
        "The problem in answering your question is that the terms and conditions of each trust are tailored specifically to the desire of the person making the trust; in this case, your mother. Consequently, it is almost impossible to answer your question without reviewing the estate-planning documents. Having said that, in that the implication from your question is that your mother has passed, it would seem probable that the duty of the trustee (you) would be to marshal the assets, pay off any debts of the trust from the assets, and distribute the remaining assets of the trust (if there are any) to the beneficiaries according to the distribution plan written in the trust. I have no idea why you have a \"Settlement Agreement\" at this stage, or at all."

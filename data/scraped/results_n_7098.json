    "question": "Looking to settle an outstanding debt ($100,000 +) with a collection agency that's been assigned the debt by the bank. The agency is asking for full financial disclosure: bank statement, pay stubs, tax returns, financial statement and a hardship letter. Is it a good idea to provide all of the above to a collection agency and what are the possible pitfalls of doing so?",

        "No, you should not hand over your financial information to a debt collection agency. If you do, it's like trying to win at a game of poker when you've already shown your opposition your cards. Be wary of dealing with debt collection agencies on your own because they are trained professionals. They will ask for as much information as possible from you, taking advantage of the fact that you as a layperson don't understand the rules of the game you're forced to play. But don't be fooled. They will use all the information they can get out of you for their own benefit.\n\nAlso, you can't ignore the debt collection agency just because it is a debt collection agency. If you ignore them, you will eventually get sued. But you should ask for validation that the debt was in fact assigned to them from your original creditor. Of course, an experienced debt settlement attorney would do this on your behalf and make sure that your interests are protected throughout the entire debt negotiation process.",
        "No, it is generally not a good idea to even negotiate with a debt-collection agency. Negotiations for settlement of a debt should be with the creditor to whom the debt is owed or the creditor's attorney. Many consumers who believe that they settled debts with debt-collection agencies are surprised when the balance of the debt they thought was settled reappears either on their credit report or as a new claim by a new debt-collection agency. Most importantly, you should NEVER disclose your personal financial information to a debt collector. You will just be making it easier for them to sue you and garnish your wages or restrain your bank accounts.",
        "I would agree that all you would be doing here would be opening yourself up to multiple issues once this turns into a lawsuit. Should you decide to pursue a bankruptcy after you've provided this \"full disclosure\", expect this company to dive into your bankruptcy petition and try to make you appear as a liar and a cheat if everything doesn't match EXACTLY as you provided to them in your initial disclosure.\n\nThis can also be a huge detriment in negotiation tactics as well and will most certainly come back to haunt you. Seek out an attorney in your area immediately.",
        "Its probably the dumbest thing that you can do. They are no going to go away out of mercy or compassion for you. They are just going to use this information to your detriment. You should retain an attorney to review and to negotiate on your behalf.",
        "The pitfall is that with your banking information if you are sued they can move right to a garnishment. You would do well to hire an attorney who is familar with the area of the law out of which the obligation arose."

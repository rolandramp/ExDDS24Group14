        "STudent loans typically fall within the exception to discharge. If you are receiving correspondence from a debt collector then they have been hired by the US Department of Education to collect a Defaulted Federal Student Loan. Yes, they can garnish your wages without filing a lawsuit. It is called an Administrative Wage Garnishment authorized under Federal Law. You need to speak with a California Student Loan Lawyer",
        "Student loans are rarely discharged and you would have had to go through a particularized procedure within your bankruptcy case in order to have discharged them.",
        "Student loans are not ordinarily dischargable. To discharge student loans, you must file a separate lawsuit within your bankruptcy called an Advesary Proceeding. In the proceeding you would have had to prove that you basically had no way to pay the loan at all in the foreseeable future and couldn’t maintain a minimal standard of living if you were having to deal with the student loans. If you did not go through this process and win, your student loans were not discharged. Very few people are able to discharge student loans because this standard is very high. If this is the case for you, you want to talk to a lawyer about your options to handle the debt. Whether the loans are private or federal will dictate what options you have for dealing with the loans.\n\nIf you did discharge the debt through an advesary proceeding, talk to a bankruptcy attorney to ensure the debt collection company has proper notice of the discharge. Good luck.",

        "I agree with my colleagues above on several points:\n\n1. If you're in the 13, you should seek the advice of counsel to evaluate the particular facts of your case.\n2. Yes, you may refinance to pay off a chapter 13 plan, but should you? That's really the question and it entails a lot of moving factors to determine if it's the best option. Will it cost you more to pay off early than it would to continue making the payments? Will your court approve the early payoff?\n3. You can also do a refinance to lower your interest rate and payments without taking cashing out.\n4. Also, if you're in a really good plan and your circumstances have changed, you may not want to bring attention to your case. It's not just the debtor who can modify the chapter 13 plan, the trustee can do so as well to seek a higher payment from you.\n\nIf you do not have an attorney, you should seek a State Bar Certified Bankruptcy Specialist and you should seek a a NACBA member (National Association of Consumer Bankruptcy Attorneys).",
        "You should understand based upon the majority of comments, and assuming you are in a chapter 13 case -that the best advice is for you should consult with your chapter 13 attorney. If you didn't have an attorney to assist in the case, I urge you to seek counsel with an experienced chapter 13 attorney. There are many issues to consider to determine what might be the best direction for you to take. In the meantime, continue making your plan payments timely and seek legal advice directly. Some of us offer a no charge half hour consultation which might assist in pinpointing the issues.",
        "If you are in Chapter 13, you would need to file a Motion for Authority to Refinance. The Chapter 13 Trustee will submit a demand during the escrow process for the balance remaining in your plan.",
        "I don't see why not. You will likely need to obtain court permission or Trustee permission to tap the equity account. If you have a lawyer, let him know what you want to do. A formal motion to the court may be needed.",
        "If you are in Chapter 13, finishing it earlier may require more than just paying off the total in your confirmation order. Most trustees would require you to pay off 100% of all claims filed in your case. And no, you will not receive a discharge of your debts until your payments are completed, your trustee audits your file, and your final paperwork is submitted. Hope this perspective helps!",
        "In a chapter 7 bankruptcy, all of the nonpriority debt is discharged unless another exception exists. Usually, all credit card debt, doctors bills, old utility bills, tax debt that is over 2 years old is discharged (or forgiven). BK is a great thing for clearing your financial slate!",
        "Ending your temper 13 early I’ll be a simple as that if your plan is paying less than 100% of your total dad and early payoff may have no benefits and that you’ll have to pay off 100% of your debt. If your plan is paying let’s say 10 percent of your debt paying off early just to get this over many be of little benefit if you have to pay a higher amount than if you just stick with your plan best to talk to your attorney",
        "I can't tell if you are a chapter 13 or a chapter 7, but before you make that decision, you need to talk to a bankruptcy attorney. Why would you want to use an exempt asset to pay off your bankruptcy earlier?"

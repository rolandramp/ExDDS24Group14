    "question": "Real Estate Judgement liens and other liens are not usually discharged after Chapter 7 bankruptcy. These liens can also attach themselves to future homes or property,that one purchases. Well after the judgement is place against them. My question is can these liens attach themselves, to cars that you have purchased , or a home that your purchased after filing for Chapter 7. As well as after the date the judgement was entered. Can they garnish wages etc. in order to collect on these liens after the person has filed for chapter 7.",

        "Attorneys debate the effect of liens all of the time. They can be tricky. You can owe a debt that can be discharged in a Chapter 7 case, and yet a recorded lien can survive the discharge of the debtor. The lien can still attach to property, even though the debt that formed the basis of the lien has been discharged. Federal tax liens stay on real property for ten years, and cannot be avoided in bankruptcy through a motion. A Judicial lien can be avoided to the extent the lien impairs a debtor's exemptions. Non-possessory, nonpurchase money liens in personal property can also be avoided in bankruptcy court, but they are not filed for record. Creditors cannot take any action to collect debts that have been discharged in Chapter 7 cases, because that would violate a debtor's discharge injunction. If a debtor files a Chapter 7 though, and does not file a motion to avoid the judicial lien, the lien survives to encumber the property.",

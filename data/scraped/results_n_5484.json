        "A hard inquiry is not the only way for a collector to have a negative impact on your credit report. It is my understanding that the hard inquiry will have a relatively small negative impact on your credit score. (The hard inquiry will have less impact than an actual collection item or negative tradeline.)\n\nDo you know what the debt is that the collector is trying to collect? Are you getting other collection activity from the collector?\n\nYou may wish to have your situation reviewed by a consumer rights attorney. I suggest you look for one at www.naca.net.",
        "Soft inquiries are credit checks initiated without your consent so the credit agencies do not lower your score fore these. Hard inquiries are initiated when you go to buy something or request credit. Enough of them will lower your score but they will fade away rather quickly.",
        "The answer to your question is too difficult to fully explain here.\n\nUnder FCRA, a reporting entity needs a permissible purpose. 15 USC 1681b states what is allowed. Collection agencies are allowed to do hard inquiries assuming the are collecting a legitimate debt."

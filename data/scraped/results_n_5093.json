        "The debt collectors that I have heard about from clients show me that they are the most aggressive and often tell the most fantastic lies when collecting payday loans. While I have seen lawsuits for amounts that low, it is doubtful they would sue you. If they don't sue, then the threat to sue without the intent violates the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA), which if proven then permits an award of actual damages and attorney's fees. If they are making up the numbers and the amounts they claim are more than they are entitled to collect per the debt and applicable law, then that also is a violation of the FDCPA, for misrepresentation of the amount due. Ask them to put this in writing and send them either letter 1.1 or 1.2 from my website's free letters, which are in the link, below. Be sure to send it by US Certified Mail and save a copy of the letter with the certified proof of delivery. The letter should stop the calls.\n\nIf they harass you on the phone, also my website has a free phone log for you to track those calls. Please be aware of the one-year statute of limitations, but I or some other consumer advocate can take a look at the calls and determine if you should sue them for the harassment.\n\nRobert Stempler (please see DISCLAIMER below)\nwww.StopCollectionLawsuits.com\nwww.facebook.com/SoCalConsumerLawyer\nTwitter: @RStempler"

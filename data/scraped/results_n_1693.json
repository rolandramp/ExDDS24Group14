    "title": "Can file bankruptcy protection if I am court ordered to pay half of the custody Evaluator's fee?",
    "question": "I might be stuck and ordered to pay nearly $8,000.00 for a 16,000.00 family law custody evaluation that I can not afford. The evaluator was private but stipulated through the court. Per court order, my Ex had fronted 100 percent of the cost, but the cost is subject to reallocation to the parties. I'm on government assistance and my Ex declares to the court that he makes 130k per year and owns two rental properties. If by some chance I'm ordered to pay half of the Evaluator's enormous fee, can I file for bankruptcy protection or would I still be forced to pay, if the court orders it? My Ex also pays to me child support but no spousal support. Furthermore, the custody evaluator wants more money, thousands, to appear in court, and additional money for a Settlement conference.",

    "answers": [
        "Yes, you can file for bankruptcy protection and I believe these charges are dischargeable. They are unsecured and I don't see them falling under any category of what are known as priority debts.",
        "I think the fee is dischargeble, but given the discrepancies in earning power between the parties, I think you should ask the court for a re-allocation of the fee.",
        "Yes. You may file for BK.\nCustody Evaluator Fees are dischargeable in BK.",
        "I agree the fee is likely to be nondischargeable. You are probably better off trying to get the court to allocate the costs a little more fairly. 50/50 does not sound appropriate given your income and the fact that he is already paying child support. I'm no divorce expert, but I would think a smart lawyer on your side might be able to get the ex to pay all of the evaluator's fee.",
        "You can always file for bankruptcy protection. I believe you are asking if you do file for relief under the bankruptcy code, will the debt to the evaluator or to the ex that has paid the evaluator be dischargeable in a bankruptcy case.\n\nYou answer depends upon rulings in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. In the Fifth Circuit, any fees, including cost of evaluation or attorney's fees of the opposing party, which person is required to pay pursuant to a court order in a case involving the custody rights, visitation rights, etc of a minor child is considered to be in the nature of child support and there fore is nondischargeable."

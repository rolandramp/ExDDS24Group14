    "title": "727 Adversary Proceeding: Best way to dispose of frivolous case and get award for attorneys fees?",
    "question": "After sustaining injuries & subsequent unemployment 3 years ago, incurred unsustainable debt. The interior of our house demolished for remodel (stopped after injury) so have no kitchen, etc. Working again, earning less & filed Ch. 7 BK. One creditor is an estranged family member. At 341 Meeting was questioned by that creditor's atty re: property value and business assets. Her Realtor valued property higher than we did. Trustee asked if Realtor saw demo'd interior and he hadn't. Trustee asked us to amend schedules & we hired an atty to do so. At second 341 Meeting BK approved. Creditor filed 727 A.P. based on Realtor's opinion/email - the only document provided for 26(f) Disclosures. Her atty said we can't get fees under 727 and is litigating. Can we get fees to hire atty? Dismiss case?",

        "The reality is that most parties believe their case is easy and the other party's case is frivolous. If the other person were to post here, we would read how strong her case is. Before you even think about getting fees (which, in the real world, is rare even for bona fide frivolous cases), you should focus on defending the case. At that point, you can see about fees. I understand you don't have a lot of money for fees, but a good lawyer might get it resolved quickly if it is truly without much merit. Unless the relative has a lot of money to pay a lawyer, she'll find out how expensive it is on her end.",
        "For this an attorney is recommended. Some courts will appoint an attorney upon request if that court has a volunteer panel, but it is not a frivolous case, it will come down to the battle of the experts. If you want to keep your house, spend the money or ask if the court can appoint you one.",
        "How much justice can you afford?\nNow is the time to find a way to retain an attorney, include the attorney fees and costs in your response for relief, and prepare your expert real estate witness, because the complaining party has the burden of proof of showing reasons your bankruptcy should be dismissed, which can be a very difficult burden.\nIn the jurisdiction I practice, such adversary actions are rare, one reason being the award of attorney's fees which must be paid if the court rules for the debtor in consumer cases.\nIf you filed as a business case, then there is no automatic award of fees if you prevail, although you probably have much more of a benefit with a discharge, than without.\nA possible compromise may be to agree to settle the one claim with the creditor involved, in return for dismissal of the 727 action.\nGood luck",

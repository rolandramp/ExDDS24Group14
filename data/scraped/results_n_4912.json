    "question": "I am curious to know if both husband and wife are required to sign a residential lease in California assuming they will both occupy the premises. If only one signs, does a landlord have any recourse against the other (in the case of non-payment) given that California is a community property state?",

        "No, they both do not have to sign. A landlord would be wise however, to get everyone who is occupying the unit to sign the lease. A landlord can get others removed along with any signed tenants if necessary.\nAnd, yes, a spouse can be held responsible for the debts incurred by the other spouse. Not all the debts, but many of them."

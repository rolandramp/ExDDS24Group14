        "I have to respectfully disagree with my colleagues. Forming a corporate entity like an LLC does not always make sense.\nThe benefits rarely acrue to a one person business. If you cause harm due to your own personal neglect you are not shielded from liability because you formed an LLC. Both you and the LLC will be liable. Also, as others have pointed out, almost no one will give a one person LLC credit without a personal guarantee.\nSo you probably won't get much benefit. Are there drawbacks? Yes. In California you pay a minimum tax of $800 a year for the privilege of doing business. You will also have to file a California tax return. You could do that yourself, but generally people pay CPAs several hundred dollars a year for that service. The money you spend might be best used to buy good insurance.\nOf course, your specific situation may change the cost/benefit of it. You'll never get a true picture just by asking general questions on a bulletin board like this one. Just know that \"always incorporate\" is not a universally held view.\nLastly, while you could form your own LLC by getting a DIY book, you can also treat your own ear infection by going to Mexico and buying your own antibiotic ear drops. Most people prefer to have a doctor make sure the diagnosis is right and that the medicine is the best for their illness. That is what hiring an attorney gives you. Of course, that also costs money.\nIn the end you'll have to make your own analysis of the costs and benefits for your specific circumstance.",
        "I agree with what the prior attorneys have mentioned relating the limiting liability. One other thing to consider is the bonding requirements associated with operating a construction company as an LLC vs. operating as a corporation. I believe that CA State Licensing Board require LLC's to post an additional 100k surety bond, in addition to the 12,500 contractor bond.",
        "Like my colleagues I am generally a fan of forming a limited liability entity (LLC or corp); however, as a startup you need to be aware of the costs associated with forming and then maintaining such an entity. Depending upon your cashflow that reality is you may need to put off forming your entity until you have the funds available for the formation and ongoing costs. For example, the entity will generally be liable to California for a minimum of $800 - even if the entity is NOT profitable. There is also a small cost associated with filing the periodic Statement of Information. The entity will need its own tax returns prepared (which may flow into your personal return if you desire) and that generally increases your annual CPA costs.\n\nAlso be aware, the most savvy creditors/lenders will also require a personal guarantee from you to get around the limited liability features of any such entity - so in terms of any financing or credit you receive, your personal assets may still be at risk.\n\nAs a contractor, one area of liability that you'll be concerned with is job site injuries and worker comp - who might be liable and how might that liability be mitigated? This is where having the appropriate insurance is important, using appropriate contracts, vetting your subs, independent contractors, and/or employees becomes important.\n\nAlso as a contractor you need to learn how to place mechanic liens and just as importantly how to perfect such liens.\n\nIn sum, at some point you will want to consult a business attorney.",

        "I always recommend setting up some form of limited liability entity, such as an LLC or a Corporation for any business.

    "title": "Can my business be sued for my personal debt even if I have a business partner who owns the other 50% of our business?",
    "question": "I'm behind on credit cards and have stopped paying. Within a year I'll be sued. Is there a way to protect my business if I incorporate or take on a business partner? I have no personal assets...only my business' bank account. Is there a legal way to shield my business from creditors?",

        "In addition to the comments previously made, you should also be aware that a fraudulent transfer can be set aside either under the Bankruptcy Code which permits the Trustee to set aside a transfer that was made 2 years or less from the filing of the bankruptcy, or if a State fraud statute allows for a longer period of time, the Trustee is permitted to set aside the transfer using the State fraud statute.\n\nLastly, the U.S. Trustee's Office aggressively prosecutes bankruptcy fraud, and you can be fined and receive jail time.",
        "Right now, you have no business assets. It sounds like you are a sole proprietorship. Transferring those assets to a corporation would be a fraudulent conveyance at this point. Talk to a consumer law attorney about what assets you have and what can be protected before making any major financial changes.",
        "Yes, your business can still be sued, as can you personally, as can your 50% partner, and no, there's really no legal way to shield your company from its creditors. You're going to be required to personally guarantee your company's debts, and partners and sole owners/shareholders are likewise liable for the business's debts.\n\nIf you have other debts you can't pay back within a reasonable time, is filing for bankruptcy a feasible option?",
        "I am sorry but the answer is no. Any transfer of assets at this stage would be considered a fraudulent transfer.\n\nKeep in mind that if you convert your business ti a Corp it does nothing to shield your ownership percentage in the business as an asset of yours.\n\nI would suggest either negotiating your debts or seek a consultation with a bankruptcy attorney.\n\nI hopes this information was helpful.\n\nJonathan Leventhal"

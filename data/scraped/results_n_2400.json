        "Couple thoughts:\n\nCompletion of the enlistment is part of the contract obligation the service member must fulfill in order to collect/keep the bonus.\n\nForty thousand may have been his reenlistment bonus, but I doubt that was paid in full so its unlikely he owes that much (unless his actual bonus was much higher and $40K represents a portion less than the whole amount)--and it would be unusual (but not impossible) for a service member to be indebted on a reenlistment bonus if the Service kicked him out for medical reasons. Almost always it will be for some kind of misconduct.\n\nDonuts to dollars you have not been given the full details of the events surrounding his discharge.\n\nIf I am wrong, and he was medically discharged, through no misconduct of his own, and the debt is not owed, he should seek out a military lawyer in CA and takes steps to address any mis-information (it happens) in the characterization of his discharge, or in the contract obligations of the government.",
        "If he has other debt as well, he may benefit from consulting with an experienced bankruptcy attorney.",
        "\"Medical reasons\"? I wonder if that is actually the case. Normally a legitimate medical discharge does not forfeit your reenlistment bonus. But neither here nor there, first your son needs to be asking these questions. Second, he can pay back the money or call treasury and arrange a repayment schedule. Third, if he wants to contest this HE will have to take steps to hire a lawyer to help him or he can go to the VA and seek assistance from some of their veteran counselors. They are usually not lawyers but can help him through the process.",
        "Like any debt issue, there may be a way to come to an agreement with the creditor. I will re-flag your question to obtain insight from debt specialists."

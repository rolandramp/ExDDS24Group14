        "If you do not file an answer within thirty days, the creditor will go to court and get a default judgment. That means the judge will give them an order saying you owe the money and, most likely, their attorney fees and costs.\n\nIf you actually owe the debt, there may be little point in filing an answer because you would ultimately win the case, anyway. Sometimes it's easier to negotiate a settlement for a reduced amount, or a payment plan, if you act before a default judgment is filed, but you say you aren't in any position to pay even a reduced amount.\n\nIf they do get a judgment, collecting it from you is another matter. If you have no assets and wind up collecting disability, they probably can't take any portion of that from you... and even if they could. they can't leave you without enough to pay for the necessities of life.\n\nA creditor has to sue you and get a judgment within certain time periods of they lose their right to collect forever. They probably just want the judgment so they can go after you if you win the lottery someday.\n\nPlease understand that this is a general discussion of legal principles by a California lawyer and does not create an attorney/client relationship. It's impossible to give detailed, accurate advice based on a few sentences on a website (and you shouldn't provide too much specific information about your legal matter on a public forum like Avvo, anyway). You should always seek advice from an attorney licensed in your jurisdiction who can give you an informed opinion after reviewing all of the relevant information."

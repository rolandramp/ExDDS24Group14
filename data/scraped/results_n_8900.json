        "You have a number of options. You can garnish his wages, or go through the legal process to put a lien against his home/business, if there is any equity in it. There are other ways to handle this. I would not go to a collections attorney, as they will ask for a significant portion of anything they collect for you. I would hire a family law attorney and seek enforcement of the judgment. If you don't want to hire an attorney go to your local court's self-help center - they should be able to get you started.",
        "Most of the tools available to you in collecting the equalization payment will require you or your attorney to obtain further court orders. Remember that your ex is not only refusing to pay you a debt, he is also refusing to comply with an existing court order. Your ex's conduct will not be viewed favorably by the court, and the court is likely to grant your reasonable requests, which can include at least the following: A) Conduct of one or more (i.e. periodic) court ordered debtor's examination under oath; B) Attorney fee award/sanction; and C) Contempt citation (fine and/or jail). The debtor's exam should reveal all pertinent information, including details of all employment and banking relationships, assets, financial details relating to income and expenses, etc.\n\nThe Federal Bankruptcy law precludes your ex from successfully discharging his obligation to you in bankruptcy. In addition to further court orders, you or your lawyer can conduct written discovery (e.g. form interrogatories, special interrogatories, request for admissions, and demands for production of documents and things) and take the deposition(s) of your ex and any witnesses with relevant information. All of your reasonable discovery requests will be enforceable by requesting the court to compel your ex or any witness to respond or comply, should that prove necessary.\n\nIn the end, if your ex remains without assets/property, your equalization payment will have to be collected via garnishment of your ex's wages directly from his employer(s). If you cannot afford an attorney, you may obtain information and assistance from a local paralegal, in addition to accessing information from your local law library and the internet.",

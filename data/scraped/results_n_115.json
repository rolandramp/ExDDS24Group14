    "question": "Please explain what statutory exceptions would exist that would impact whether or not I could fall within the new $300-$600k homestead exemption system. The articles mentioned things like voluntary loans against the home and other things. Does that mean if I took out a second, a heloc or refi, I would run into an issue qualifying?",

        "The other responses given so far are correct, but did not answer your specific question. There is a provision of the Bankruptcy Code which mandates a reduction in the exemption by any amount that the equity was increased with an intent to hinder, delay or defraud your creditors, by using (for example) a non-exempt asset to increase that equity.\n\nThis is really the opposite scenario than your question regarding taking out a HELOC, etc. For example, if you had $100,000 in cash sitting in your bank account, which you wanted to protect from your creditors, because it is NOT otherwise exempt in bankruptcy, and you used that money to pay down your mortgage, or pay off your HELOC, thereby creating additional equity which still enabled you to fall within the $300,000-$600,000 new homestead exemption limit, that would likely be considered fraudulent and the allowed exemption amount would be reduced by the amount of that transfer of non-exempt funds.\n\nAs others have stated, this is a very complex area of law and you need experienced bankruptcy counsel to advise you on your specific circumstances.",
        "I was honored to work with CA Senator Bob Wiekowski to get the new homestead exemption passed in California. I testified before the State Senate in August in support of this bill. My colleagues have both made good suggestions. Yes, the minimum homestead exemption in CA is $300,000 and the maximum is $600,000. But, it is based on the median priced home in CA per county. The county data can be confusing. But, that's not all you have to worry about when applying the homestead exemption. There are other federal caps that could drop your exemption to $170,350.

        "The amount of the new homestead exemption that becomes effective January 1, 2021 is the greater of $300,000 or the countywide median sale price of a single-family home in the calendar year prior to the calendar year in which the judgment debtor claims the exemption, not to exceed $600,000. There is a single amount countywide, no longer tied to marital status, number of dependents, age, disability or income.\n\nAccording to the Los Angeles Times in an article published October 21, 2020, in Los Angeles County, the median sales price rose 14.5% from a year earlier to $710,000.

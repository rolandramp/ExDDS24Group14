    "title": "Can my private nursing school (LVN) withhold my academic transcripts, diploma and not send in my NCLEX-PN licensure application",
    "question": "Even though all my debts to the school are paid? Yes, i owe NO money, they have been paid the 20 thousand dollars of my tuition already. My first loan payment is due in 5 months, and what was supposed to be a 12 month program has turned into a 13 month program, and almost 14. They are telling us that we cannot have our transcripts, diploma, and they wont send in our applications to take the state examination until we complete the \"NCLEX REVIEW\" as stated in the school catalog. However the catalog says the review will be BEFORE our final examination, and if we dont complete the review we cant take the final examination, and we wont recieve any of our things.I took the final exam and passed. They scheduled this 6 week program AFTER the exam.Again, they have been paid. Do i have a case to sue",

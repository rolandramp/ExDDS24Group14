        "Assuming you had an attorney assist you with your Ch7, the first thing you should do is contact your attorney as this may well be a discharge injunction violation and, as Mr. Shirdel indicated, you may be able to not only get your attorney's fees paid, you may be able to get sanctions paid to you by the credit card company or the collection agency.\n\nIf you did not list the creditor in your petition and schedules, it may still be a violation fo the discharge injunction, but you will have a much harder time getting fees and especially compensation. Further, I don't know how California bankruptcy courts deal with unlisted creditors so I will defer to California practitioners, but where I practice whether an unlisted debt is discharged in a Ch7 depends on whether the debtors case was a \"no asset\" or an \"asset\" case. The distinction is whether there were assets taken by the Trustee and distributed to your creditors. If no asset there was nothing to distribute and the creditor did not missout on anything because they did not receive the notice of the bankruptcy nor did they miss out on the opportunity to file a proof of claim and their debt will have been discharged despite the fact they were not noticed. If the case was an asset case and they did not receive the notice to file a proof of claim and thereby missed out on the opportunity to receive soemthing from the liquidation of your assets, then the debt will not be discharged and they can continue to seek to collect it.\n\nGo see your attorney.",
        "If you included them on your schedules and the judicial lien was recorded after the filing then the lender violated the discharge order. If the lien was recorded prior to your filing of bankruptcy, then you should have brought a motion to avoid the lien. If you didn't include them in your petition and schedules, then the debt is valid.\n\nIf the debt should have been discharged and the lender violated the discharge order, then you can bring a quiet title action against them. You may be able to get your attorneys fees paid as well for bringing the quiet title action.\n\nIf you'd like to discuss your case, feel free to contact my office.\n949-333-5921\nwww.pacificpremierlaw.com\n\nGood luck to you!",

        "Mr Wrobel's numbers are for the Ch13 \"means test\", but otherwise correct. You can count the car in both the operating expense category and the ownership/lease category.",
        "Means Test - 1 vehicle operated for paragraph 27a; for paragraph 28, you subtract the average monthly cost from the IRS standard ownership.\n\nSchedule B has nothing to do with the means test.\n\nA leased vehicle need not be listed in Schedule B.\n\nRegular loans are not included in the Means Test.\n\nI suggest you contact an experienced local bankruptcy attorney to assist you.",
        "Take the standard deduction on means test and you wouldn't list on schedule B because you don't have an ownership interest in the vehicle. You need to list the lease on Schedule G as an executory contract. You also need to list the creditor as a secured creditor. You need to indicate on SOFA that the vehicle is property you're holding for a third-person. You should get an attorney."

    "title": "How to protect my $35k judgment I obtained in state court for Fraud from Debtor trying to discharge it in adversary proceeding?",
    "question": "I would like to find out if I can still file a summary Judgement. My former attorney is out of my case. I have trial on 5/6/20 and exchange exhibit and witnesses list on 4/6/20. At my malpractice case both my expert witness and his expert witnesses said that he missed both deadlines to challenge a fraudulent will and my creditor's claim against it, and concealed these facts from me. Thank You",

        "I agree with William. I have found that the administrative discharge process can be very tedious. After you supply information and complete the forms required, you will probably be asked to supplement with additional information, which may happen more than once. After several submissions of requested information, you may be informed that time has expired and that you will be required to start over again.\n\nOur firm has found that after the process has bogged down to the point that our client must start over again more than once, even the administrative discharge process can be moved forward by filing a bankruptcy and then filing an Adversary Proceeding (a lawsuit in the bankruptcy case, for short I will call this an AP). Once the U S Attorney or other attorney is involved we are told that our client can receive an administrative discharge, We provide the attorney representing the student loan lender with a history of the attempts to obtain the administrative discharge and we start the administrative discharge process agin. This time, the process almost always goes smoothly and quickly.\n\nMy recommendation is that you SHOULD NEVER CONTACT a national company that you find on the web advertising to get rid of your student loan debt. Many of these companies will take your money even if your particular set of facts tells them that you have no chance of discharging the debt. You should check out this site and other provided by the U S government:\n\nAn experienced bankruptcy lawyer that handles chapter 7 and chapter 13 bankruptcy cases and understands the administrative student loan discharge process can help you understand what can be done and should be done. Many attorneys will give you a free consultation to help you make the decision on what is best for you. You can use the Avvo \"Find a Lawyer\" link above to search for an attorney in your area.",
        "After you exhaust your remedies you may be able to file a bankruptcy and sue within the bankruptcy to have your debt discharged. It does not happen often because debtors who may qualify cannot afford to pay an attorney to sue on the student loan. For most people the best answer is to keep trying to qualify for some of the programs."

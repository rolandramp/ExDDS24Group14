    "question": "I had to stop working due to disability due to a health condition. I am now receiving disability benefits, but they are a lot less than my previous income. I have run up a lot of credit card debt (aprox 40 thousand) paying bills and medical expenses. I have been paying the minimum monthly payments, but will not be able to afford to do so for much longer. If I stop making payments and attempt to negotiate a settlement, can the credit card companies sue my husband (in addition to myself) ? My husband owns a rental property which he purchased many years before our marriage. Our home is in his name, but the home equity loan is in both of our names. My main concern is whether they could force the sale of either property in order to pay the debt. We live in California.",

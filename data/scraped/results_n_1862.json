    "title": "What does this mean in layman's terms? \"To equalize the division of the community property ASSETS and DEBTS\" (CA Form FL345)",
    "question": "Number 3 of the Property Order Attachment to Judgment (FL 345) says \"Equalization of division of property and debt orders. To equalize the division of the community property ASSETS and DEBTS, Respondent (me) must pay to the other the sum amount of $$, payable as follows (specify): $$ per month until paid in full.\" I have paid this and the judge granted my motion for satisfaction for this. The pension (if eligible) was listed in Number 1e (division of community property ASSETS). Is the pension included in equalization of the division of the community property ASSETS and DEBTS (Number 3 above)??? Or can my ex still try to have my pension divided if I do decide to retire?? What does this mean please?",

        "In a divorce, there must be, as close as possible, an equal division of all assets and debts. So, the phrase required you to pay something to the other party to make it all equal. As to the pension, I would need to read the judgment for its specific language to see if the equalization was included as an a partial \"offset\" for this asset. Take the judgment to a family law attorney to get your specific question answered.",
        "Unless the pension was valued (it's called \"reduction to present value) what you paid was for other assets\n\nYou really should not be without expert input on such a life changing situation.",
        "The pension is to be divided outside the equalization payments. She may still be entitled to a portion of your pension."

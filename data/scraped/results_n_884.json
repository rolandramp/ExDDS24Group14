        "\"Qualifying\" for a chapter 7 bankruptcy is not really the correct way to describe this, but effectively it's close. Qualifying to file and discharging particular claims are two completely separate issues. What debt is dischargeable? What rights do certain creditors have to your assets as part of a security agreement? What asset might you lose to the court-appointed trustee if you file? If you file individually, what effect does your filing have on your spouse?\n\nThese are questions that can only be answered by an experienced bankruptcy attorney and only after a thorough discussion of your particular situation. That discussion goes beyond \"net\" earnings to subjects such as types of debt you have, changeability of debt, assets, income, events that have occurred over the past several years, such as transfers of assets, payments to creditors or family... This list is long and detailed. Without this detailed consultation and examination of the facts, you can't really know how a bankruptcy will work for you and what the likely result will be.\n\nAs you can see, it goes well beyond being able to file, but whether you should file and what it will do for you.

        "The person you spoke to at the \"auto loan place\" is there to collect on a auto loan.

    "question": "I am a single mom with 3 kids. Years ago I lent a friend 50000. he has not paid. long story short, threatened to file bankruptcy if I went to court. Which I did. Won the judgement and was inches to garnishing his wages before I was noiticed of the banckruptcy. He lied under oath to pass presumption of abuse and I am certain I can prove it. I filed an advesarial proceeding 12/26/17. I can't find anyone to talk to. Anyone who represents the creditor in this situation.",

        "I suggest you speak with the US Trustee's attorney on your \"evidence\". Why? Because if they bring an action to prevent ALL his debts from being discharged, then your adversary wont matter! If they dont, then you better prevail and it is hard to establish an exception of fraud, but the facts and details govern that issue. And the debtor might be awarded attorney fees if they prevail in some such adversaries too. Good luck.",

        "You should contact the trustee assigned to the case and give him/her your facts to support your claim. On what grounds did you file an adversary action? Fraud? Click the Avvo tab \"Find a Lawyer\" and talk to a creditor's rights lawyer in your area. Some offer a free consultation. Good luck to you.",
        "Are you saying he made too much money in the last 6 months to qualify under the Mean's Test? If so then you will want to bring this to the attention of the judge. I would speak with an attorney who could possibly assist in representing you. If he makes to much money to qualify for chapter 7 then he may have to convert his case to a chapter 13 or 11, where you could receive money as a creditor, maybe not the entire amount you are owed, but some money. Or, if his case gets dismissed then you can continue garnishing his wages.",
        "If he borrowed money \"years ago\" - more than 6 - you probably should not have gotten the judgment if he did not pay you for that time. But what abuse? You don't tell us. Merely going to bankruptcy so he doesn't have to pay you is legal."

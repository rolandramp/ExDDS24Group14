    "question": "Dad and mom are on deed . Dad wants to add a son that has child support in arrears. What is the best way to add son so mom can not be the only one to make decisions in the event of dads death?",

        "I agree with Mr. Benton. Mom and Dad need to speak with an estate planning attorney to properly plan and attain their goals.",
        "Putting the sun on the deed would have the effect of rendering the property subject to foreclosure to pay the child support debt. If the intent is for the son to receive the property when his mom and dad both die, then the prior answer is correct. You create a revocable testamentary trust, and transfer the property to the trust. Deposit the trust documentation with an individual who is appointed to do the terms of the trust upon the death of mother and father. Under the terms of the trust, the son can receive possession of the subject property in the event of his parents death, and title to the property can remain in the name of the trust. That way the child support (hopefully) would not be payable from the value of the real estate upon the death of the parents, since the sun would have possession of the home, and could live in it, but would not own it. Of course, some provision needs to be made in the terms of the trust, to take care of such issues as property tax and any mortgage payment. These can be handled by charging rent to the son, who would pay money to the trust; and the trust would pay the debts arising from the real estate.",
        "That would be the worst thing he could do. The best move would be to have mom and dad place the house into a revocable trust and then appoint successor trustees in addition to mom as a successor trustee. But, DON\"T put son onto a deed. Not a good idea.",
        "You most likely will have to draft a new deed and file it with the property records or wherever your filed your deed previously."

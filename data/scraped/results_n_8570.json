You will lose the case eventually so you can settle it by making a lump sum payment if you have access to some cash or pay a greater amount in payments but that will depend on what the creditor will accept. You might have to pay court filing fees and hire an attorney to represent you and negotiate a settlement if possible. Again bankruptcy might be the only way to get a fresh start free of unsecured debt. If you make too much money or have too much property you might benefit from Chapter 13. Again, look at the advantages and disadvantages of bankruptcy first not after you start the never ending frustrating and expensive process of defending a bunch of lawsuits.",

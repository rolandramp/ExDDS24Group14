    "title": "Does filing under Chapter 13 eliminate unsecured debt,i.e credit cards,car recpos ?",
    "question": "I was told that chapter 13 converts automatically to chapter 7,I am confused because I thought Chaper 13 is to protect secured debt.And if the creditors for the unsecured debt don't show up for the chapter 13 hearings, at that point is the unsecured debt dismissed??",
    "answers": [
        "You make a payment based on several factors, usually only pennies on the dollar, and at the end of the bankruptcy (which may take 3-5 years) your debts are elimindated. (ie discharged)",
        "Depends. Dischargeable debts are discharged in a properly filed and completed C13 BK.\nC13 does not automatically convert to C&. Only debtor can decide to convert to C7 BK. Debtor also has option to voluntarily dismiss C13 BK.\nProceed very carefully when considering conversion to C7. Debtor has no unilateral right to dismiss a C7 BK.\nQuestion evidences some confusion. Suggest you consult BK counsel before proceeding.",
        "A Chapter 13 does not automatically convert to a Chapter 7. If you are thinking about converting then you should consult with an experienced bankruptcy attorney who can properly advise you if converting is in your best interest.\n\nTypically unsecured creditors do not show up at the 341 hearing (the meeting of creditors), however unsecured debt is not discharged until you complete your Chapter 13 plan.",
        "Your question is very confusing. Please call and consult with an experienced bankruptcy attorney so you can understand how to move forward in your situation. A Chapter 13 is a reorganization plan where you are paying back some or all of your creditors (depending on how the plan is structured); this can include secured and unsecured debts. A Chapter 7 only eliminates unsecured debts. If you are in a Chapter 13 and cannot afford the \"plan payments\" then a debtor may elect to convert to a Chapter 7 (if qualifies) to just eliminate unsecured debts.",
        "Chapter 13 cases are not automatically converted to a Chapter 7. The effect of a Chapter 13 discharge can have the same look and feel as a Chapter 7 discharge, however.

Chapter 13 is not something you can likely do well on your own (nearly every Chapter 13 case filed by the individual debtor fails).",

        "Although it may be possible to convert from Chapter 13 to Chapter 7, this does not automatically happen.

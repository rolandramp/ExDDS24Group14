        "The California Deferred Deposit (\"Payday Loan\") law does not apply to Internet payday loans. You could stop paying them, change your bank account and never get a payday loan again. Payday lenders are among the worst creditors you can have, especially Internet payday lenders. Like Internet gambling companies, most Internet payday lenders operate outside the law in foreign jurisdictions that protect them.\n\nInternet payday lenders also tend to use the worst debt collectors, but they almost never file lawsuits to collect the unpaid debts. As in your case, they have already been repaid the loan proceeds, therefore, anything they collect from here on is pure profit for them.\n\nIf you start receiving collection calls and letters from debt collectors, you should send them a cease and desist letter. A fill-in-the-plank cease and desist letter is provided below."

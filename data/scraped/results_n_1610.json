    "title": "Can my license be suspended even while paying back a debt to the Maryland State Central Collections Unit?",
    "question": "I have a collection notice from the Maryland Central Collections Unit for tuition owed to UMUC (online only school) and it's NOT Student Loans. I live in CA and currently working and have stopped school. I have a Current CA driver's license. I have heard the Maryland CCU can suspend license and garnish wages. To be honest I'm most concerned about my license being taken away. My question is can they do that if I'm making minimum payments? I was told by the CCU that I only have 6 months to pay off $5800. I don't have that kind of money any where. I was told also that I can make minimum payments, but in 6 months if it's not paid back in full then they can take more actions. So say that I'm making $200 payments on it from now till it's paid off. Can they suspend my license while doing so?",

        "It's hard to tell exactly what is going on with your matter. However, I generally agree with Mr. Johnston that there are limited instances where a license can be suspended. Your best bet is to communicate with the CCU and get it in writing that they will forego any action as you pay it off.",
        "You really need to consult with a local attorney to ascertain what your options are. No one in this forum can read the contract that was the basis of your loan. Good luck.",
        "Generally, a drivers license can be suspended if a debtor has an unpaid judgment for damages incurred in a vehicle accident. I'm not familiar with Maryland's judgment enforcement laws, but I doubt they could suspend your license merely because you owe a debt. However, if the \"Maryland Central Collections Unit\" is a governmental agency then it's conceivable. Government agencies frequently reserve rights for themselves that are not available to the general public, which would be the case if the debt is owed to a private school (unless, as Attorney Harrell mentioned, it's a federally guaranteed student loan.)\n\nMore information is needed before a comprehensive answer can be provided (by me, anyway), but I've been enforcing judgments for many years and I'm unaware of any state statute that permits the creditor, even a governmental agency, to suspend a drivers license merely for owing a debt.",
        "If this is an unsecured account owed to a school, as opposed to a student loan owed to a lender for tuition payment, you can discharge this type of debt in a Chapter 7 case. If the debt is discharged, the state agency will not be able to obtain a suspension of your driver's license. If you have lived in California for at least 90 days, you should get a California driver's license anyway. Go speak to a bankruptcy attorney about discharging this debt."

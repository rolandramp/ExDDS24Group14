    "title": "Collection agency contacting me for not paying up shoplifting debt",
    "question": "In November 2009, I made a huge mistake and was caught shoplifting at a large fashion retail store. I stole about $120 worth of clothing and ever since then, I have received many civil demand letters wanting $475 from me, which is ridiculous. I decided to ignore all of them and today I received a letter from a collection agency saying that the creditor will turn my name over to a licensed collection agency and this could harm my credit if I don't pay up what I owe.",

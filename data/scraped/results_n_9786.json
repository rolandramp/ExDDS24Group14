    "question": "credit card company summoned me for $2,000. I did not go to the court and if they put a judgement on my credit card is this a criminal offense?",
    "answers": [
        "From the information you've provided, you have a civil judgment against you for $2000. It is not a criminal offense.\nTo make certain there are no criminal charges against you, call your local DA's office, which would be the Sacramento County District Attorney's Office. Ask the receptionist to run your name and date of birth. You'll be informed if they have any pending case against you. If so, you can go to the courthouse to get it put on calendar.",
        "If your were served with a legal document called a Summons and Complaint then you are being sued in civil court. It is possible that the court would enter a judgment against you if you do not appear. However, if you did not receive valid personal service of the Complaint, then you may have an issue to fight based on lack of notice. If the credit card company believes you have committed credit card fraud, then they would have to provide the prosecutor's office with any proof of such alleged fraud. The prosecutor would then decide if there is enough evidence to file criminal charges against you.\n\nSincerely,\nDebra S. White, Esq.",
        "Your question is not clear. Did the credit card company sue you for not paying your credit card bill? If that is it then what they can do is garnish your paycheck if you work, or put a lien against any realty you own. This does not sound like a criminal case, so jail is not in the equation."

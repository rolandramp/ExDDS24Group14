    "title": "Who is responsible for filing a Satisfaction of Settlement/Judgement when the previous lawyer is now out of business?",
    "question": "Back in 2006, I defaulted on a Capital One credit card. I later settled out of court, entered a payment plan, and paid the debt in full. Now I need the lawyer who filed my case to submit a Statement of Settlement/Satisfaction of Settlement to the court, as it's still being reported as Unsatisfied(they only dismissed the case w/o prejudice). However, I found out today that the lawyer's office is no longer in business! Who is now responsible for filing the Statement at the courts? Can Capital One's current lawyer file it? They have on file that the debt was fully paid.",

        "You don't need your prior lawyer. Ask Capital One to confirm that the debt is satisfied and file the appropriate documents with the court. If the debt is truly satisfied, they should have no problem taking care of this step. If Capital One won't do it, find out why - that would be unusual. You may file the documents yourself if Capital One is not cooperative.",
        "The party (cap one) through counsel. Or you can file with court and ask court to file satisfaction of judgement of course with proof of what the stop judge my was and proof of its satisfaction ( payments to judgment creditor ).\n\nGood luck."

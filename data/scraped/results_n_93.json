        "You need to see a local attorney about this. The rule you speak of is tied to when the claim arose, so there is not way to tell under the facts your presented if the deadline for you claims is extended or not. There is also no way to tell if the rule overrides your tolling agreement without more facts. You need to seen an attorney right away.",

    "question": "Will this manager be protected from personal liability for business debts and claims?",
    "answers": [
        "Yes. Frequently the LLC manager is not a member or has a non-equity membership. Unless the manager signs personally there will not be an obligation for business debts. Note any check signer or responsible person, especially a manager, will be liable for unpaid payroll and sales&use taxes.\n\nI hope this helps!\n\nRon Cappuccio",
        "There is no requirement for a Manager to be a Member. There is no personal liability for a Manager assuming the LLC was properly formed and maintained, and even then, the employer is normally liable for the act of employees.",
        "An LLC manager does not need to have either an ownership or other economic interest in the LLC in question. Generally speaking, the manager is not liable for the debts of the LLC or the claims against it - although there are some things for which a manager can be personally liable, such as unpaid sales taxes.",
        "The answer to both questionss is yes. LLC law specifically allows for managers without an ownership interest. Managers are shielded from liability unless they personally participate in a tort, such as fraud or intellectual property infringement."

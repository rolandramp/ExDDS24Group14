    "title": "Can my ex reopen an alimony case? We have been divorced for 2 years and I'm told she is reopening to get more money...",
    "question": "Our final divorce agreement was for me to take all debts and children's expenses + pay 1000 per month for a year. Every thing is filed and I have copy of the judgement. I did continue to pay an additional $500 per month for the next year as well to help her out, but now that I am no longer paying her she has opened a case with child custody dept (even though I have full custody) and I'm told that she hired a lawyer is going to try and \"reopen\" the alimony case and try to get more. Can she do this? I have not been served anything, but told by a friend that there is a hearing in November. She is no longer talking to me since I asked her about it and I'm completely in the dark after being in great communication about everything for years.",

        "As to alimony, unless the judgment has a \"termination\" date for spousal support (taking away the ability of the court to give her alimony after a specific date), then she can \"ask\" the court to give her more alimony now. There are circumstances under which the judgment can be attacked, but those are beyond what can be said here. As to child support, generally, upon a showing of a material change of circumstance, child support can be modified until it terminates upon the latter of the child being 18 and graduated from high school or nineteen years of age. If she attacks the judgment, you will really need an attorney.",
        "In California spousal support is modifiable unless it has specifically been made non-modifiable by agreement of the parties (this is an over simplification of the law, but it works for this response). An attorney would have to review the judgment to give you a more precise answer. As this is a spousal support order made in a judgment it is a \"permanent\" (again there is no such thing but that term is used to differentiate it from a temporary or pendente lite order) the court must consider the factors set out in Family Code Section 4320. You can go to the courthouse where the dissolution was filed and pull the file to see if any pleadings for a modification were filed if there are you can have copies made to take to your attorney. This does not equate to making an appearance and/or being served with the pleadings. There are attorneys who will take the cheap shot of waiting until the last possible day to serve the pleadings to minimize the amount of time you have to respond, although I cannot say this is what is happening.",

        "If spousal sup;port was \"reserved\" in the final judgment then your spouse has a legal right to file a motion to have it reconsidered. If it wasn't reserved, then it can't be \"reopened\" if the court terminated jurisdiction."

    "question": "I am in Chapter 7 bankruptcy, and hoping to keep my car. The Blue Book value of the care is 3600 and I owe 4601 on my loan. My loan is a month in arrears, and the new payment is due in 3 days.",

        "Whether the vehicle is exempt has no bearing on the rights of the secured lender. In your case, your lender has a lien on the vehicle and that creditor can (and ultimately) will exercise its right to repossess the vehicle if you fail to make timely payments. If however, you wish to consider discharging the debt in light of the fact that loan exceeds the value of the auto, the bankruptcy process will allow you to walk away from the car and the associated obligation with no adverse consequences",
        "I concur with my esteemed colleagues and add the following: lack of appearance by a creditor at your 341a meeting has no bearing on that creditor's right to foreclosing/repossessing the car.",
        "As the others have pointed out, the Trustee not taking an interest in your vehicle has nothing to do with your obligation to make the required contractual payments on it. If you want to keep the car, you must get, and stay current with, the payments on the vehicle.\n\nAnd if your vehicle is financed with either Ford Motor Credit or a credit union, you probably need to enter into a reaffirmation agreement, otherwise they will be able to repossess your vehicle after your bankruptcy case is completed regardless of whether you are current with the payments or not.\n\nYour attorney should be able to advise you as they know all the specifics of your situation.",
        "If you wish to keep car you should catch up with all your payments. The creditor can get relief from automatic stay and repossess the car. You should have filed in you statement of intention whether you intend to keep the automobile or not.",
        "If you want to keep it, you need to make your payments. Your lender may be willing to work with you to have you catch up. They may also want you to enter into a reaffirmation agreement to keep the loan in place after the bankruptcy is over. You'll want to at least consult with an attorney to go over your options.\n\nThe lender cannot repossess the car as long as the automatic stay is still in force. The stay will remain until the bankruptcy closes unless your lender formally asks the court to allow them to act to repossess. In short chapter 7 cases, lenders tend to not go through that process, especially when the borrower is current on payments or pretty close. Go pay a good attorney for 30 minutes of their time. It will be worth it.",
        "Continue to keep your car payments up to date and current. If you are not current upon discharge, the car lender can repossess the vehicle. It has nothing to do with exemptions. If you have any issues after your case is Discharged, then you may want to consult with a local San Diego Bankruptcy attorney for assistance.",
        "If you want to keep the car, you must pay for it. The trustee stating that it is exempt means the trustee will not take it away from you. The company you owe on the car loan can still take the car from you if you do not pay.\n\nIf you are behind, the car loan creditor can ask the Bankruptcy Court for permission to take the car away from you. The whole court process to do that will not take very long, so it is important that you catch up quickly if you want to keep the car.",
        "If you want to keep the car you should keep making payments on it. Creditors rarely attend 341(a) meetings. If you fail to make payments. The creditor can get permission from the Court to repossess your vehicle or they may wait until your bankruptcy is concluded to repossess. If you catch up on the payments, they cannot repossess.",
        "If you don't have an attorney you may need one now. If you want to keep property in bankruptcy, you have to pay for it. You don't get a free car just because you filed bankruptcy.",
        "If you want to keep your car you will have to continue to make payments. Because the creditor is secured it will always have the right to repossess the vehicle, even after bankruptcy. While you are in bankruptcy the right to repossess cannot be exercised due to the automatic stay, unless the creditor moves to lift the stay."

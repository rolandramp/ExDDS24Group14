    "answers": [
        "They are required to file a satisfaction of judgment with the court and provide you a copy to record.",
        "You should send a formal demand that they file an Acknowledgment of Satisfaction of Judgment. Your notice should include the following language, from C.C.P. 724.050: “Important warning. If this judgment has been satisfied, the law requires that you comply with this demand not later than 15 days after you receive it. If a court proceeding is necessary to compel you to comply with this demand, you will be required to pay my reasonable attorney’s fees in the proceeding if the court determines that the judgment has been satisfied and that you failed to comply with the demand. In addition, if the court determines that you failed without just cause to comply with this demand within the 15 days allowed, you will be liable for all damages I sustain by reason of such failure and will also forfeit one hundred dollars to me.”",
        "Read and follow Section 724.110 of the Cal. Code of Civil Procedure to get the judgment creditor to acknowledge how much of this judgment you have paid. If all of the judgment has been paid, then the box for \"In Full\" should be checked.\n\nThe statute states the debtor (your daughter) serve an acknowledgment of partial satisfaction and the creditor must comply within 15 days, or after that, you can get a court order in your case if they refuse to comply. Similarly, if you have satisfied all of the judgment (in full), then Section 724.050 applies.

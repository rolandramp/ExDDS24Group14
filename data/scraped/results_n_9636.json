    "title": "Is bankruptcy the only answer to credit card dept after facing a hardship such as disability in CA?",
    "question": "My fiance recently became completely disabled due to an accident. His only income is Social Security and he has no assets except a car and some recreation items, nothing of great value and items we are trying to sell just to make our monthly living expenses. He has credit card dept of around $10K, far exceeding any assets. He doesn't have any money to file for bankruptcy and he doesn't have money to pay anything toward the debt. Are there other options such as a charge off and how do we get the credit card companies to do it? Can the credit card companies take anything from his Social Security? All credit is with collection agencies now.",

        "Your fiance is what is known as judgment proof. If he has no assets and his only source of income is social security then there is really nothing creditors can do. Even if they were to sue, they would be unable to garnish his social security income. Bankruptcy would, however provide you with the benefit of stopping all the harassment so if you want to get creditors off your back for piece of mind then he may want to consider filing.\n\nLEGAL DISCLAIMER\nMr. Larkin is licensed to practice law in CA and is located in San Diego.

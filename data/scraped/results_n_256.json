        "You should be able to file. I did a jail BK years ago and it worked out fine. Your lawyer can go to the jail to visit husband for interview and for doc signing purposes. I have seen police escort other prisoners to Bankruptcy Court for creditors hearings (\"341\" hearing). With Covid-19, your creditors hearing may be telephonic which could make the process easier. It could cost a little more because your lawyer will have to make a couple of trips to the jailhouse, but it should work out.",
        "Yes, he can file while incarcerated. He must be able to participate in the preparation of the information required for filing; receive and review documents; sign documents; and if possible, arrange a phone consult with an experienced bankruptcy attorney. Currently, the bankruptcy trustee hearings, which both of you would normally have to attend, are currently being conducted by phone and sites such as Zoom - depending upon the Trustee. I have also had cases where one of the filing clients was physically unable to participate in the hearing, and the trustees provided questions to be answered in writing and submitted. So there may be some options for you.",
        "You can file together, but he must sign all documents filed with the bankruptcy court. This can be done despite the incarceration. The bankruptcy trustee should allow him to participate in the creditors' hearing remotely or by answering written interrogatories under oath.",
        "Yes, you and your husband should be able to file jointly. He would just need to review and sign documents after speaking with a bankruptcy lawyer. It would be appropriate if a bankruptcy lawyer could speak with him over a call or in person during a prison visit. Most bankruptcy trustees are reasonable and would work with his circumstances.\n\nI hope this proves to be helpful."

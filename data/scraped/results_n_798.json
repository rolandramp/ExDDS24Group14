    "title": "I recieved a discharge today, how do I know if the lender will be taking my boat or abandoning it?",
    "question": "My chaper 7 was discharged today in San Diego as a result of business debt (I didnt have to do the means test). I did my filing Per Se, it was a no-asset filing with my assets all under the wildcard exemption. How do I know if the lender plans to pick my boat up in Mexico? Or how would I know if they abandoned the lien?",

        "You can contact them directly to ask what their intentions are with the boat if they do not contact you to make arrangements. Good Luck!",
        "You are free to ask the creditor your questions now that the case is discharged. The automatic stay is no longer in effect after discharge is entered and the trustee is not interested in your assets per the no asset filing. You may need a lawyer to help you wrap this up as to status of boat lien. Good luck!",
        "As you have probably heard everyone on this site say in answering these questions, no one should file a bankruptcy case without an attorney. In particular when one is dealing with secured debt and a business situation, an attorney is needed, so I hope you had one.\n\nAn experienced attorney would have helped you with the process of dealing with this secured loan. A secured creditor doesn't \"abandon\" a security interest during a bankruptcy. In some types of case, the value of that interest can be reduced by the court, but unless there was a motion do redeem, that wouldn't have happened. So, as at least one of my colleagues has stated, they still have the lien.\n\nAdditionally, that would be title lien for a boat and it doesn't go away. You can't legally transfer title to the boat as long as it has that lien on it. You will still need to deal with the creditor in some way to resolve this.",
        "Trust me, th lender did not abandon the lien. The creditor may not come after you for the debt on the boat, but when you go to sell it or otherwise transfer title, the lien will be there and you will have to pay the creditor some amount of money to remove it. Your choice when you filed bankruptcy was to either re-affirm the debt by signing a re-affirmation agreement with the lender or else surrendering the boat to the lender as part of the bankruptcy."

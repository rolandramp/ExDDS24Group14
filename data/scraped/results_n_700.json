        "Yes you can file bankruptcy regardless if you have any amount of credit card debt, or if you only have the medical debt you describe. There is no minimum amount of debt required for you to file for bankruptcy protection and relief. Likewise, the Bankruptcy Code has no requirement that you have credit card debt, or any (other) certain type of debt, to be eligible to file bankruptcy.\n\nThe only caveat here is that you must include all creditors of any amount when your bankruptcy case is filed; you are not permitted to “pick and choose” among the creditors/debt that will be included in your bankruptcy case."

    "question": "I am filing Chapter 7 bankruptcy - without representation.",
    "answers": [
        "The reaffirmation agreement is generally a new promise on a prior obligation. Sometimes lenders will negotiate more favorable terms for the borrower, however, I would strongly suggest you have help from a bankruptcy lawyer.",
        "The Reaffirmation Agreement is provided by the vehicle lender. It requires specific information regarding your income and expenses and evidence that you can afford to make the payment. It is critical for you to seek advice from an experienced bankruptcy attorney to assist and advise you on this matter. This is not something that should be done without full knowledge of the impact of signing such a document.",
        "You try to fill out the form as best you can and send it back to the car lender. Or, you get representation and have your bankruptcy done right."

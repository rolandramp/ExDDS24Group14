    "question": "I pay a given amount monthly...actually, they take it from my check. I don't think there is really a balance; just a recurring charge. Also, I am trying to figure out whether to call myself a household of 2 (including my daughter). She is with me part time.",

        "You might be able to claim a household of two if she lives with you part time and you support her.

The 2005 changes to the law place this burden on the trustee.

        "The monthly expense of the child support gets listed on Schedule \"J\" and in the appropriate place on Form 22A (in a chapter 7 case). If you don't owe any past due support, it does not get listed on Schedule \"E\".\n\nMark J. Markus, Attorney at Law\nhttp://www.bklaw.com/"

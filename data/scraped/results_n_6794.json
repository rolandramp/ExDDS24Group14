        "Although your spouse can file Chapter 7 & list these debts, there are no odds available on whether or not the AG will file an adversary action to force him to repay the overpayment of unemployment benefits. Even in Las Vegas, we can give odds on this type of things. Issues to consider in the AG making a decision would include the amount involved and the facts behind the overpayment of benefits. Another factor would be how busy the AG happens to be.\n\nIn Chapter 7, attorney fees must be paid in full to get your case filed. With Chapter 13, you usually pay a deposit on legal fees and the rest are paid through your payments to the Trustee.\n\nHope this perspective helps!",
        "Your husband can file a Ch7 but whether the unemployment department will file an objection to discharge noone here can answer. If they feel that he intentionally misstated his situation in order to fraudulently obtain benefits AND the amount in question is reasonably large, they may well object. If it is a few hundred dollars to maybe a couple thousand, they probably will not bother. If it is more than a few thousand, they may well. Consulting a local attorney would probably be in your husband's best interest.",
        "Generally speaking, you were told correct information. The reality isn't about whether or not your husband can file a chapter 7, but rather whether the overpayment and penalties will be discharged/dischargeable. Did you have a question as to something beyond what you were told? If so, I'm sure we would all be happy to answer it for you."

    "title": "Bank Levy after Summary Judgment. (State of California, EDD) . Will they levy my internet bank based in Utah (Ally)?",
    "question": "I am appealing this judgment as my husband is in the military (we move alot and mail comes slowly) and we were unaware about the case and only found out a month later by getting a Summary Judgment in the mail. I have closed our Wells Fargo accounts and emptied them but we have a online savings account and want to know if I have to do the same. I haven't gotten a levy notice but the judgment scared me.",
    "question_tags": "Bankruptcy,Debt,Wage garnishment,Bankruptcy and debt,Appeals,Court orders",
    "answers": [
        "Yes, they can take it. Since Ally has branches in California, they would levy upon it there and would probably not need to domesticate the judgment in Utah.",
        "They can if they find it! They don't even need a special court order if this bank has any presence in your state. The location of the bank HQ is immaterial. Hope this perspective helps!"

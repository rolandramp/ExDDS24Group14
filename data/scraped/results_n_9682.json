    "question": "It's my understanding that the amount of time for a credit card debt to be considered time-barred in California is four years. However I'm hearing conflicting opinions on when that clock starts (date of original default or last payment).. My credit report says for one account that the date of original default was two years ago but the last payment was one year ago..........which date should I use to determine time-barred status should I need to in the future?",

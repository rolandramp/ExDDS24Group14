        "I agree with my colleagues who have recommended consulting with a bankruptcy attorney before you communicate with creditors regarding payments or settlement. You may find that bankruptcy is your best option for you. Seek advice from an experienced bankruptcy attorney in your are. An initial consultation should provide you an overview of your situation and options for handling your financial issues. Good luck.",
        "You clearly indicated that you are in a bad way and have had several bad things happen to you. What you need to do is obtain a fresh start as soon as possible and use what little you have left to get there. Creditors are not your friends and you will gain nothing by attempting to settle the debt if you do not have the financial resources to do so.\nFinding a place and staying current on your rent should be of prime concern. Good luck.",
        "Other than time, I'm not sure what you hope to buy by negotiating with your creditors. That said, you can discharge your past due rent in a bankruptcy, but the landlord can charge you rent post filing, and can evict you for unpaid rent, even if you do file. There are provisions in the code for bringing a landlord current, if he doesn't already have an eviction order, but to stay in the property, the arrears have to be paid eventually.\nTalk to experienced local bankruptcy counsel to find out your best options.",
        "If are going to seek discharge of your debts in a BK 7, what is it you think you will gain by \"negotiating\" with your creditors? Absent any more facts, I would call it a waste of time.",
        "I agree with Pamela Koslyn's answer, except note that if you should go ahead and file bankruptcy, any money you paid to your creditors would have been wasted. I think you should get a consultation with an experienced bankruptcy attorney in your area (many are free) to find out whether bankruptcy would be right for you. If so, I say go ahead with that and save your money.",
        "You're the only one that can answer a \"should I\" question.\n\nIf you're planning to file for bankruptcy protection if you can't make your debts manageable, then you have nothing to lose by trying."

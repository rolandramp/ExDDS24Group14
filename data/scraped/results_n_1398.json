        "You do not \"write a letter.\" You file a proper responsive pleading with the court clerk. You must pay the court filing fee, or request a fee waiver from the court. Your Answer or General Denial must be filed with the court within 30 days of the date when you were served. You should meet with a lawyer to review your possible defenses and your rights so that your pleading will properly allege any and all affirmative defenses. Good luck. The best time to meet with a lawyer is now, not after you make a legal mistake when representing your self.",
        "Consult a lawyer. The summons does not say what you indicate. You must file a legally recognized response to the complaint (an answer, demurrer or motion to strike). If you simply write a letter to the court, it will likely be ignored and the company will bet a default judgment against you.",
        "Scammers don't file legal documents with the courts. Portfolio Recovery is a legitimate business that collects delinquent debts. Time to deal with this rationally and not play the role of victim. Hope this perspective helps.",
        "It is company that buys debt in default. You need to answer the lawsuit to prevent a default judgment from being entered against you.",
        "Portfolio recovery is a debt buyer who I have dealt with many times. How much are you being sued for and is it portfolio recovery internal law firm in Virginia? I have handled many cass against them and they are willing to negotiate",
        "You can answer the complaint, and file it with the court within 30 days of being served. They have to prove the debt at trial."

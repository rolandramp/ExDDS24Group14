    "title": "I have a writ of execution to take funds from my checking account. I owe the debt and would like to make a settlement offer?",
    "question": "I’m a 60 year old disabled widower on SSDI. My monthly income is $1706. I owe a judgment in the amount of $44000 including penalties. I want to make a settlement offer or else I will need to file for bankruptcy. What do you recommend as my best option?",
    "answers": [
        "As some of the attorneys mentioned above, if the only funds in your bank account are SSDI, the creditor cannot touch your bank account but you have to take certain steps to make sure the creditor and the court that entered the judgment is aware of this. You do not likely need to file bankruptcy if you are judgment proof... i.e. only on ssdi and no assets, unless you really want to. You should at least call a bankruptcy attorney for a free consultation and evaluation of your assets and debts.",
        "I agree with my colleagues that a discussion with an experienced Bankruptcy attorney initially is necessary to verify the protection of your assets. Once that concern has been addressed, I see no harm in contacting the creditor to inform them of your intention to file bankruptcy and if they are willing to settle for the same fees that you would be paying for a bankruptcy. Again the art of negotiating a settlement in a case like this could be challenging so I would recommend you discuss this matter with an experienced debt defense firm.",

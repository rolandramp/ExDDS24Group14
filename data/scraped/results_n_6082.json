    "title": "As a sole proprietorship why can't i claim protection under the FDCPA or the Rosenthal Act for a BofA, Wells or Chase loc?",
    "question": "Are there any protections for an individual doing business as \"biz name\" sole proprietor from unfair or unethical collection actions? I've been threatened with jail, called wet back, awaked at 5am, called on my job by collectors trying to collect a disputed line of credit for my detail business I started when my divorce was going on. The line of credit was in my name and Hector's Car Care Name. I am in San Jose, California and not a corporation or partnership.",

        "The FDCPA and California Rosenthal Act (RFDCPA) apply only to \"consumer debt\".

There are laws to protect debtors\nfrom this sort of egregious behavior - a tort action for infliction of emotional distress, for example - but unlike the FDCPA and RFDCPA they do not contain an \"attorney's fees\" provision, whereby your attorneys fees are paid by the other side if you win.

        "You have an exemption that covers $2,750 of equity in one motor vehicle. Additional exemptions may also apply. You get to keep exempt property; exempt means exempt from execution or levy. Creditors rarely levy on vehicles, especially if the vehicle is financed. They would have to pay you $2,750, plus the costs of the Sheriff, the tow company, storage and auction fee, and then pay the balance on the car loan, before trying to sell it at auction. It is most unlikely that your vehicle would sell, at a car auction (i.e., without warranty etc) for more several thousand dollars more than you paid for it.",
        "The Writ of Execution for the bank levy was only applied to the bank account in 2012. It's likely they would need to obtain another Writ in order to obtain possession of your new vehicle. The new vehicle is secured by $18,000; so, I'd assume there's no equity in the vehicle. If there is no equity, the creditor would not benefit from taking possession. Moreover, the cost the creditor would incur to file the necessary paperwork, take possession of the vehicle, and then sell it at auction would likely not be worth the creditors time. A creditor could come after your vehicle, but for the amount of $2,600 it's more likely they would attempt another bank levy and other collection tactics first. In the end, it's tough to say what they would do because each party is different and they can use any tactic they want.",
        "No you should not worry about the car unless the car is worth more then you financed, in words if the creditor took your car and paid the finance company would there be anything left over? You should see a bankruptcy attorney if you have other debts that you can't pay along with this instant one."

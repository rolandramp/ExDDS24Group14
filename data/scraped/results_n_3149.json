        "I deal in the world of mergers and acquisitions. In my field, when one company succeeds to the rights and obligations of another, through a corporate purchase, for example, that company is the successor corporation. If you run your company in such a way that there is no real separation between your business affairs and your personal life, the company can be deemed your \"alter ego\" meaning that, from a legal point of view, there is no difference between you and it. This often happens where a business owner pays all his personal expenses through the company. If your company is deemed to be your alter ego, this is bad, because it means creditors can attack your personal assets, even if you claim they belong to the corporation, because you have failed to maintain any distinction between what belongs to your business and your personal assets.",

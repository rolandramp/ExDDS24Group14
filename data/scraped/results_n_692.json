    "title": "I am asking about the SOL on medical debt in California of 4 years? After the 4 years the defense is the SOL.",
    "question": "The statute of limitation has run meaning I can't be sued to collect this debt. If I send a letter admitting I owe the debt, I extend the statute for another 4 years I was told. If I do nothing, the debt will be removed from my credit reports and there will be no further reporting of the debts. Debts remain subject to collection as long as someone cares to try, but third party collectors can't call my cell phone without my permission in advance of the first call. These are things I have been told by other attorneys. Just verifying this information. What else can I do to remove bad credit reporting concerning this medical debt? I do not answer any calls unless I know the caller. Thank you, Mark",

        "I agree with Mr. Lyse. In addition, keep in mind there are powerful federal laws that govern the conduct of debt collectors and creditors, and you could be entitled to money if companies are violating collection laws. Under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (\"TCPA\"), if creditors or debt collectors are calling your cell phone using an automated system (robocalls), AND the calls are made without your consent, each call to you is worth $500. In addition, creditors and debt collectors are bound to comply with the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (\"FDCPA\"), and they are prohibited from harassing you with excessive calls or aggressive tactics. If debt collectors are violating the FDCPA when attempting to collect your debts, you might be entitled to up to $1,000. If you believe any collectors violated your rights, you might want to consider speaking to an experienced consumer protection attorney for advice. Most consumer protection attorneys do not charge for their services.",
        "The statute of limitations refers to the time in which a lawsuit must be filed. The SOL is an affirmative defense, meaning that if you are sued, you must plead the defense in your answer and prove the facts at trial. If the creditor filed a lawsuit within the statutory period, the creditor can prosecute the lawsuit and can enforce a default judgment. As far as credit reporting is concerned, the credit agencies can continue to report the delinquent account for 7 years. You can dispute anything in your credit report by sending a dispute letter to the credit reporting agency.",
        "I'm not sure thats accurate. They typically have 4 years to sue you but they can typically report the debt for 7 years.",
        "No, that is not correct. Even though you could use the statute of limitations as a defense if they were to sue you, the fact that the statute has run does not mean that the credit reporting ends. I will reposition this on your credit repair."

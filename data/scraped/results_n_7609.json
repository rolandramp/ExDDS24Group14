        "Yes, it does. That does not mean that you cannot still proceed in an out-of-court, efficient process - you don't have to have a lengthy, expensive, contested divorce. If you and your spouse agree on how to divide assets and debts, and if you are in agreement on issues like spousal support, you should speak with an attorney who can prepare all of your paperwork for you (with all of the magic legal language). Many of us do this for a flat rate. If, however you need help in reaching those agreements, you may want to look into mediation or a collaborative divorce process. Either way, you still have options that can help you keep the costs down and the process peaceful. Do your research, get yourself informed as to what these processes are and who would be the right professional to speak to to achieve the goals you have set.

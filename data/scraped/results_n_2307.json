        "We have already reached the 10k cap for last year so that means you have to wait until you get a letter from USCIS which says that due to lack of visa number cannot process your visa, however, you may apply for EAD.",
        "It is unlikely your U visa will get expedited with these circumstances, plus there is a cap of 10,000 U visas per year. You should be able to extend your EAD while your U visa application is pending. Have an attorney review your case and see if it is possible there is something else to apply for.",
        "I have done hundreds of U visas. The only way to expedite a U visa is if you are in ICE custody, and ICE chooses to request that it be expedited in order to get you out of ICE custody. Even then, it often doesn't get expedited. You'll wait about a year+ to get an answer back on your U visa, and even then it will probably be deferred action. You can then apply for an EAD based off the deferred action."

        "Property formerly characterized as community can be transformed to separate property via a valid court order. Generally, a trustee will not likely disturb/contest/dispute such a court order, especially since it was issued two years ago. The trustee is looking for recent transfers made by debtors seeking to conceal assets. Yours is not the case.",
        "A legal, court ordered, separation allows one party to file bankruptcy without generally including the separate property or earnings of the other.\nAs my colleague indicates, a trustee may require proof of the arrangement, and may argue lack of consideration received for a transfer of property to undo the transfer, but the existance of a court order is a strong impediment to anyone who wants to contest the court order.\nGood luck.",
        "In a variety of circumstances, divorce is not the same as separation (in BK court). Nevertheless, the court judgment/order awarding certain community assets to your wife means those assets are no longer community property and are, instead, her separate property. They are not available to the BK court (unless the Trustee wants to try to argue that it was a fraudulent transfer becuase you received nothing of value in return)."

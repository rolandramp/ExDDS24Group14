    "title": "What forms do I need to complete to bifurcate in Riverside County? Mediation isn't working.",
    "question": "What forms do I need to complete to bifurcate in Riverside County? I filed for divorce over 1 year ago. We have attempted mediation but the only thing we've solidified is the custody and visitation. Debts were cleared via bankruptcy, but there is one remaining student loan that we haven't agreed how to split. I'd like to bifurcate so I can remarry as I anticipate spousal support will drag on.",

        "A motion to bifurcate must be filed unless the parties stipulate. There is no form--you have to prepare a motion, serve the other party by mail, and show up at the hearing of the motion.",
        "Does the other party agree to bifurcate? If so, you would prepare and file a stipulation for entry of Judgment (status only).\n\nIf they do not agree, then you need to file a motion for bifurcation of status. They issue generally is simple, unless you are providing benefits to your spouse which would end on the divorce. In order to obtain the early status judgment the law requires you to continue to carry those benefits. The receiving party can waive those, but why would they? Look at family code section 2337 for the requirements.\n\nStudent loans are usually pretty simple, so why is that holding up the divorce? Unless party who received the education can't work then they should keep the debt. See Family code 2641 for guidance. It might be quicker to resolve that issue and the support then to seek the bifurcation.",
        "Generally, in order to bifurcate you need to file a motion, set a hearing and file a notice of hearing, and go before the Judge. California may have other requirements and you should check with your Clerk of Court for appropriate forms if you don't have an attorney."

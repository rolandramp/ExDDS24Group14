        "Please do not embark on a Chapter 13 case by yourself. Hiring a competent lawyer can save you a lot of time, money and hassle.\n\nAs far as the substance of your question, I practice with an important caveat: When in doubt, fully disclose. I can always argue whether the information I've disclosed is pertinent or insist on my view of how it should impact a case, but leaving out income entirely is a strategy fraught with peril and one that I avoid at all costs.\n\nI would also include all business debts and contractual obligations as well. It is not uncommon for small business owners to forget they signed a lease or other agreement with a personal guarantee. You want absolutely everyone notified to make sure all personal obligations are fully discharged at the end of your case.\n\nGood luck."

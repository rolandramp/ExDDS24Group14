        "In addition to the very good answers posted above, you should explore the possibility that the licensing board would accept, in lieu of full payment of the debt, a signed agreement between you and the creditor showing that you have agreed to a payment plan. After all, not all persons who apply for a license are debt free, they just want to see that you are not so financially unstable that you might use your license, in a bad way, to resolve your financial issues.",
        "NMLS licensure is very exacting and the situation you describe does not suggest any straight-forward or obvious \"right\" answers. I suggest that you consult personally with a skilled and experienced licensing attorney for a detailed analysis of the full circumstances of your situation. This fact pattern is beyond what can be addressed here by general info and broad strokes. Very difficult situation!",
        "To resolve the Judgment Lien, you need to pay it off in exchange for a Satisfaction of Judgment. You can contact the Judgment creditor and discuss the possibility of settling for less than actually owed. Keep in mind, if the Judgment was for $35,000 in 2008, it is considerably more now since Judgments carry an interest rate of 10% per year."

    "question": "Hello, a friend is interested in visiting the US at a future date but due to her current financial troubles, she is forced to file for personal bankruptcy, her main concern is will this appear on her record when the embassy does a background check on her and could this contribute to having her visitor visa application rejected? since being bankrupt could be read as \"bad moral character\".",

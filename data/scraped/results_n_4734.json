        "CACH is a junk debt buyer that bought your account from the original creditor for pennies on the dollar and is now suing you for the full amount of the original debt. It is likely this company does not have the necessary documents to win this lawsuit. You must challenge it however. If you do challenge it, this lawsuit will likely be dismissed without you paying anything. while your social security is exempt from garnishment you do not need to have a judgment against you, if for no other reason than this company will not have the documents to win this case. If you do not respond to it they will win by default. Though they may not be able to garnish your benefits they can make you appear for depositions and answer questions about what assets you may have--right up to asking you if you have any money in your pocket.\nYou need to contact an attorney who handles these credit card lawsuit claims. Such an attorney will know exactly what the lawsuit is missing and how to have it dismissed. I suggest you go to the website for the National Association for Consumer Lawyers and use their lawyer search to find a lawyer near you.

        "As for your concern about a summons without a date, do you mean there is no trial or hearing date given? That's the norm. The summons notifies you that you have been sued, and when it is properly served on you gives the court jurisdiction over you. The complaint spells out the bases for seeking to collect money from you. You must respond within 30 days of service of the summons or risk being defaulted. Although your Social Security income is exempt from enforcement of judgment, you would be better off not having a judgment against you at all--you might have other assets that could satisfy the judgment. Consult a local debt collection defense attorney to find out how best to proceed from this point on. Good luck.",

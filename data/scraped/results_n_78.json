    "answers": [
        "Sorry to hear.\nI have discharged over $3 Million in student loans in bankruptcy and filed over 58 Student Loan Adversary lawsuits. And all my cases, wins, losses, settlements are posted on my website too so persons understand legal action can be taken. But DO NOT CALL me on those..I am retired from student loan litigation after all those cases. Federal and private loans options are treated differently too to some extent.\nFederal loan options can be many of their programs and establishing undue hard ship or sometimes an option like private loans below.\nOn Private loans, FIRST, the creditor must establish they fall within the definition of 11 USC 523(a)(8). Both the 5th and 10th Circuit Appellate Courts have interpreted that Statute differently than we have done in the past all to the benefit of the debtor. As a result, most private loans must fall in a very long definition because of the various terms of the statute are further defined and complex and beyond the scope of AVVO forum. I hope other attorneys in other circuits read those cases and try to defend more often such lawsuits but in reality it is the cost of debtor’s paying, and attorneys willing to accept payment over time to allow those to move forward. I know a trial in Western Washington is now set for July of 2021 on that issue too.\nIf the creditor can in fact establish their debt falls within the definition , then the debtor’s options include:\n(1) do nothing. Eventually they may sue you. Then they have judgment which they can try to enforce. Can they seize your assets? We don't know what you own. But social security will be protected. Then eventually the ability to enforce the judgment will end! (When depends on the state law governing said loans).\n\n(2) Settle. Terms of how much, monthly payments, interest, etc. are all up to you. Will they report written off portion as income to IRS and then you have taxable income? Don't know. But will it in fact be taxable at that amount of income on your tax returns is unknown as that is beyond the scope of this forum too. Any lender NOT wanting to settle for something from someone on Social Security is foolish in my eye; although again, we don't know all your assets (but they probably don't know either).\n\n(3) You file bankruptcy and then file an expensive adversary proceeding against the Student Loan place assuming that loan falls within the definition set forth in 11 USC 523(a)(8). Then you have to represent your self or pay an attorney and easily over $50,000 in legal fees. But what if you file and then offer to settle.. They don't want to pay for their attorney fees either\n(I had a client back in 2017 I have helped file a PRO SE Student Loan adversary and on morning of trial Navient agreed to discharge over $68,000!!). Another client more recently settled with many defendants and had over $400,000 in such loans approx.). Thus, each case is different. But you cannot reach a result if you don't try! That is the lesson to learn.\n(4) Call private lender and see if they have any options whatsoever also and advise you are ONLY on Social Security if true. What does it hurt? Plus in a student loan trial on Prong III that will show good faith that you inquired also which is one of the factors and thus do it even if you are not going to pay them a dime!\nThe world of student loans is very complex and most bankruptcy attorneys have NEVER filed such an Adversary Case . I have helped hundreds of clients for advice on them. But only practice in Western Washington so please do NOT call me or email for advice as this is answered to help you give some guidance to options. You can always try and call the Bankruptcy Judges in your area and ask the clerk if they know of any attorneys names who have filed student loan adversary cases. You can also ask if the Judge has any written published decisions on such subject. You can also Google and inquire with bankruptcy attorneys if they know of any such attorneys litigating in your area.",
        "Yes, you can file bankruptcy for yourself. Your husband's name will appear as a source of \"community\" income, and if he is a co-debtor on certain debts, that will also be disclosed.\n\nadditionally, if he is a co-debtor on debts that do not get paid, there is certainly a possibility that the non-payment will be reported do the credit bureaus.\n\nThere is hope on the student debt issue; have your counsel review Koeut v. US Dept. of Education:\n\nBANKRUPTCY NO: 12-07242-MM7 Adv. Proc. 18-90130-MM; 12-04-2020\n\nIn re: SETH KOEUT, Debtor, SETH KOEUT, Plaintiff, v. U.S. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION; GREAT LAKES EDUCATIONAL LOAN SERVICES, INC.; and DOES 1-10, Defendants.\n\nGOOD LUCK!!",
        "I completely understand the predicament you find yourself in. As to the first question, can you file without including your husband. Yes you can. Without any further information, it is unknow if your filing by yourself will have an adverse impact on joint assets. This is for a more detailed discussion at a later time. As for student loan discharge in bankruptcy, that is a very tricky question, as indicated by the other attorneys. It is highly fact specific, and there very well may be other alternatives in dealing with your student loans that an attempted discharge. You need to consult with a student loan/bankruptcy attorney.",
        "You have received several excellent responses from my colleagues to which I add the following:\n\nRemember, BK is more than checking boxes on forms you find online. Find/consult/hire a lawyer in your area using the Avvo feature \"Find a Lawyer\". Make a list of 4-5 having many 5 star reviews from satisfied clients. If you don't get a prompt call back from one, go on to the next on your list. Some offer a free consultation by phone or in person. Take us up on it.",
        "I agree with the statements made above by my colleagues. Student loans are difficult to discharge. I have a 100% success rate in discharging them. However, that rate is misleading, because I only file the adversary proceeding to seek dischargeability in cases I know I can win - THAT is how difficult they are to discharge. I don't want to charge my clients for something that has a 90% failure rate.\n\nWith all this said, don't jump into bankruptcy just yet or without a full consultation with a reputable and experienced bankruptcy attorney - preferably a State Bar Certified Bankruptcy Specialist. There is a major push to restore dischargeability of student loans in bankruptcy. In fact, the House passed a bill to do, but could not get the bill passed in the Senate under the old administration. One year ago today, I was in Washington, D.C. with my colleagues meeting with our Reps and Senators to educate them on the student loan debt crisis and how restoring dischargeability in bankruptcy is the best option to assist those who really need the help. I firmly believe something will change soon. If you file your bankruptcy before the bill is passed, you won't be able to take advantage of it when it passes for appx. another 8 years.\n\nGet a free consultation with a good bankruptcy attorney to evaluate your needs and to create a plan.",
        "First, I agree with my colleague Robert Firth that discharging student loan debt requires skills beyond those possessed by run-of-the-mill bankruptcy attorneys. Second, success is difficult, but generally the result of facts more than finesse.\n\nThe large amount of student loan debt ironically works in your favor, since the ability to repay a lesser sum would tend to undercut your chances of obtaining a discharge. But you cannot treat the student loan as only an obligation in your discrete financial world, since you and your husband presumably share your finances and his ability to contribute to household expenses will bear upon the determination as to whether repayment would constitute a hardship.\n\nOn the other hand, even where the entire amount of the student loan cannot be discharged, the Ninth Circuit has held that a partial discharge may be granted where there is only the ability to partially repay the loan. See In re Saxman, 325 F.3d 1168 (9th Cir. 2003). The Saxman decision has been upheld and cited 102 times in the Ninth Circuit alone. It is still good law after 18 years.",
        "Unfortunately, student loans are not routinely discharged in a bankruptcy case. They are one type of debt that is excluded from a discharge that comes at the conclusion of the typical bankruptcy case.\n\nIn order to attempt to discharge student loans, you would file an \"adversary complaint\" (essentially, a lawsuit litigated in the bankruptcy court). After that was filed, the case would proceed towards a trial date when the issue would be decided. You would have to prove that repayment of your loans constitutes an \"undue hardship.\" The federal government (Department of Education) and any private lenders almost always oppose the effort very aggressively. They would attempt to demonstrate that you do (or will) have the ability to repay some amount of your student loans, if not now, then in the future.\n\nYou may want to research this issue and then discuss it with a bankruptcy attorney in your area.",
        "it is extraordinarily difficult to discharge student loans in bankruptcy, and most bankruptcy attorneys don't have the skill or training to do it. Go on AVVO to find attorneys who do it. Attorney DJ Rausa who is licensed in California and Tennessee is well experienced in this area. You can find him on AVVO."

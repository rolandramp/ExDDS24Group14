    "title": "Can collection agencies still update the status of an account during chapter 13?",
    "question": "In 2014 I filed chapter 7 and then 2017 chapter 13. I have a medical debt which went to collections in 2015, the collection company has been updating the account status every month on my credit report since it started in 2015, despite notice to them in the 2017 chapter 13 filing. My bankruptcy attorney says creditors should not be reporting and they are in violation of bankruptcy law but states he only represents me in the bankruptcy filing. Not sure if I believe his statement. So, is there a violation that is actionable? and should my attorney handle this or is it not his deal? If not, who?",
    "answers": [
        "What is the \"status\" being updated? Is it accurate?\n\nDo you dispute the credit report? Have you notified the credit reporting agency that you dispute the reporting by that creditor?\n\nDid that creditor submit a timely Proof of Claim and is that creditor being treated in the chapter 13 plan? Did you object to that creditor's Proof of Claim on some basis?\n\nIs that creditor receiving money from the chapter 13 trustee from your plan payments?\n\nIf you can show how an inaccurate report is damaging you somehow, it is possible you could have an action under California Consumer Credit Reporting Agencies Act. But I don't expect those would be substantial damages to justify a lawsuit, unless you explain more.",

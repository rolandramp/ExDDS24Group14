        "\"Charge Off\" is an accounting term used by a creditor to indicate that your account with them is uncollectible. Usually, companies \"charge off\" debts to report the debt as a loss on their books for tax purposes.\n\nIf the debt that has been charged off is the kind of debt that is otherwise dischargeable in a chapter 7 bankruptcy, then - yes, it will be wiped out once you receive your discharge.\n\nHowever, the \"charge off\" history will likely stay on your credit report as a record of your account payment history for seven years - although the current account status should say something like \"included in bankruptcy\" and show a zero balance owing.\n\nFor Schedule F purposes, you should list both the original creditor and any collection agencies.",
        "A charge off is no different than any other debt. This phrase simply refers to a debt that is more than 180 days old. Debts don't go away on your credit report, they are simply noted as being dischaged by the bankruptcy.\n\nTo prevent having to amend your bankruptcy, it is best to list both the original creditor & the collector as linked. This helps you to clear up your credit after the bankruptcy is discharged.\n\nHope this info helps & good luck!"

    "title": "Can I be sued twice or have wages garnished for a collection account that was settled outside the court but fail to pay?",
    "question": "This is an 8k fraudulent loan that was opened under my name by an ex-fiance in 2018 online. The original lender discharged the account off my credit as a charge-off and balance shows as 0. In the summons served to me is a blank \"Loan Contract Term and Agreements\" with no name, account number or signature from me. They have included a few payments made from a joint account I had with my ex-fiance. I have since closed that account due to this. Would calling the collection company and asking for proof a good idea? Should I mention to them I am in the process of applying for chapter 7?",

The fact that payments were made from an account that is now closed, does not matter. The only question is, did a creditor sue YOU (not your ex); did you received notice of the lawsuit; did you respond to the lawsuit, and if not, did the creditor get a judgment?\n\nIf you need help, contact a debt collection defense attorney in your area."

    "title": "Can i be sued after my chapter 7 bankrutcy if I have been making good faith payments and stop paying them now?",
    "question": "I have a personal loan and the company is holding my car as collateral. The loan was discharged in my bankruptcy a year ago. I have been making good faith payments to them to get the title back on my car. If I stop paying and let them take the car , can they sue me?",
    "answers": [
        "If you reaffirmed the debt you are personally liable for the debt. If you did not reaffirm they can take the vehicle because the discharge does not void the security.",
        "Attorney Bunce is correct. Since the loan was discharged by your bankruptcy, the only remedy for the company is to repossess the vehicle should you failed to make the payments. The company cannot sue you for the discharged debt.",
        "Once you have been discharged in a bankruptcy, all that a title loan company can legally do is repossess the vehicle if you don't make payments. If they should try to sue you, the discharge paperwork is your legal defense to a lawsuit.\n\nHope this perspective helps!"

        "Ultimately, the judgment creditor can levy any of your assets which are not exempt from collection.\n\nIf your business is a sole propietorship or partnership and the account is under your social security number, then the creditor can likely levy the account fairly easily. If it is a corporate or LLC account then the creditor would most likely need a charging order before they could collect the assets in the account but they could eventually reach the corporate or LLC assets."

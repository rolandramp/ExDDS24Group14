    "title": "Getting out my business partnership and Will I be liable for past advertisement sales if a contract is made?",
    "question": "I have a business partnership (no LLC, corp). We have an operating agreement; My business partner owns 70% and I own 30%. We produce business magazine (hard copy/digital) we generate revenue through advertisement sales. I want to get out of this business because my business partner is mismanaging money and not putting the magazine out on schedule. This is shady and I do not want to be involve anymore. I dont want to be financially liable for his lack of money management. What do I need to do to get out of this situation? Can we create a contract for me to resign from the company and most importantly, I am no longer financially liable with the advertisement sales we made? (not factoring taxes, phone contracts, offices leases) thank you! hope to hear from you!",

        "It will depend on what your Operating Agreement says. Generally, he can buy you out of your share of the business or you can dissolve your partnership (and then he can start his own business by himself.) In either situation, you will need a clearly written agreement between the two of you that specifically addresses the liabilities that arise out of events which took place during the time you were with the partnership. Best of luck to you!",
        "You don't indicate if your operating agreement is in writing or oral. If in writing, any attorney would want to analyze it. If not in writing, California law imposes a general partnership \"agreement\" on two or more persons doing business together for a profit, with unlimited liability for each of the general partners. There are agreements to exit (e.g. with indemnification and release provisions) or legal procedures (partnership dissolution and accounting and perhaps other causes of action) that you may use to exit.",
        "Unless it is a limited partnership, any partner in a general partnership is liable for all partnership debts.

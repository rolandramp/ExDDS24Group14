        "Typically a corporate dissolution requires the owners to state that they've settled all existing debts and distributed all assets of the company. Also typically, when a partnership/LLC dissolves, there's an agreement, like there is in a divorce, of who gets what, and the LLC's Operating Agreement spell out what happens in a dissolution.\n\nA company's name, or trademark, is a valuable asset, as are its product inventory and business model (and trade secrets, customer lists, etc. etc.). If your LLC's dissolution was atypical, see a business lawyer to help you get it sorted out."

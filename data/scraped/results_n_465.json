    "question": "In 2011 I received a line of credit with a vendor to make purchases on net 30. At the time I personally guaranteed the debt as line in their contract. Everything was fine but my business fell apart in 2018 and I was forced to close my business. The debt is 46k and now they are hitting me with legal fees and 18% interest on said debt.",

        "It sounds like personal bankruptcy, Chapter 7, may be your best option. If you file a response to the lawsuit then you bought yourself some times in terms of the creditor obtaining a judgment against you, but you will want to consider a bankruptcy sooner rather than later. I recommend contacting some experienced bankruptcy attorneys to discuss your options. Your wife's income will be considered in the chapter 7, even if she is not filing, so you want to make sure the household income (both incomes combined) passes the mean's test in order to qualify for chapter 7.",
        "Personal bankruptcy may be your best option. A chapter 7 case, for example, should eliminate the litigation and any personal guarantees. Courts take into account the income of the non-filing spouse in California to determine chapter 7 eligibility. Consult an attorney.",
        "Personal bankruptcy may very well be your best option. I suggest that you use the AVVO Find a Lawyer tab to find one or to bankruptcy lawyers in your area and give them a call. Most offer free initial consultations."

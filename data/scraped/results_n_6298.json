        "A bankruptcy attorney if your entire financial situation warrants it.",
        "A bankruptcy attorney analyzes your financial situation, to determine if filing a chapter proceeding is helpful and appropriate, usually for a person to obtain a fresh financial start. In the process, all debts and assets are reviewed.\n\nA foreclosure defense attorney will assist in resolving a mortgage default, as my colleague has said, by seeking various appropriate remedies.\n\nOften remedies and assistance can be provided by the same attorney.",
        "It all depends on what you want to do. First off I would speak with a bankruptcy lawyer to see if you need or desire to file a bankruptcy. A foreclosure defense attorney defends against a foreclosure or tries to work out an arrangement with the bank such as loan modifications, deed in lieu, or a short sale. Your 401K is protected with way."

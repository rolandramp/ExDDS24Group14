        "If this is a small claims judgment, you really don't need to spend the money for an attorney to take the debtor's examination. You can do the following yourself:\n\nFirst, fill out Form SC-134 (Application and Order to Produce Statement of Assets and to Appear for Examination) which can be found at:\n\nhttp://www.courtinfo.ca.gov/forms/fillable/sc134.pdf\n\nand Form SC-133 (Judgment Debtor's Statement of Assets) which can be found at:\n\nhttp://www.courtinfo.ca.gov/forms/fillable/sc133.pdf\n\nYou should also serve the debtor with a small claims subpoena for any documents you want the debtor to produce, using Form SC-107:\n\nhttp://www.courtinfo.ca.gov/forms/fillable/sc107.pdf\n\nTake these forms to the courthouse to get a hearing date.\n\nThe subpoena (Form SC-107), the notice of debtor's examination and judgment debtor's statement of assets (form SC-134 together with form SC-133) must be personally served on the debtor by a registered process server or the sheriff's office.\n\nAt the debtor's exam, you will be able to ask questions of the debtor. Some courtrooms will actually give you a questionnaire for the debtor to fill out. Otherwise, for a list of sample questions to ask, go to:\n\nhttp://www.courtinfo.ca.gov/selfhelp/smallclaims/collectsampquest.htm\n\nThe debtor will be put under oath, but in most counties you will ask the questions yourself. The questioning will usually occur outside the presence of the court commissioner or judge, such as in the hallway or in a jury room.",
        "Your question is unclear as to whether the judgment is against you, or in your favor.\nIn either case, however, you should definitely consult a lawyer before conducting (or appearing at) a judgment debtor's examination.\n\nIf you are the judgment creditor (i.e., the judgment is in your favor) and you suspect that the judgment may be collectible in some substantial part, then hiring a lawyer may literally pay off. If you hire a lawyer, your lawyer can subpoena records to the examination, and enforce compliance with the subpoena, more easily than an inexperienced party acting as his or her own attorney. A lawyer can do the questioning and take enforcement steps that are suggested by the answers.\n\nOn the other hand, if you are the judgment debtor it may be in your best interest to file a bankruptcy petition before attendance at the examination is required. If you do appear, your lawyer can make appropriate objections and argue them to the judge.\n\nGood luck\n\nDean",
        "Your attorney can definately handle the debtor's exam. But when you are collecting on a small debt, you can use the court's self-help page located at:\n\nwww.sdcourt.ca.gov/portal/page?_pageid=55,1665742&_dad=portal&_schema=PORTAL\n\nIf you have any other questions your attorney or any attorney with collection experience can provide guidance.",
        "Yes."

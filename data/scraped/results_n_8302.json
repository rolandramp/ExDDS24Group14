        "Since your business is a sole proprietorship \"the business\" is really you. There is no separate entity. Therefore it is you - not some separate entity - that is paying the medical insurance premium. And it is deductible on line 34 of the means test.\n\nIf you were to consider the payment of your medical insurance premium to be an expense of your business then the trustee might contend that the payment of a personal expense by your business should be income to you.",
        "I agree with my colleague from New York. If you pay medical insurance through your company, it should be deemed a business expense and a deduction from income. I also agree that you should consult with your attorney or, if you do not have an attorney, an attorney in your area who will know what your local trustees will and will not accept.\n\nGood luck!",
        "Whether or not it is a \"business expense\" or not is something your accountant would need to determine (and, if necessary, testify on), but either way there is a separate column for health insurance expenses on the means test form, so if you are still above the median income based on your gross income, you can subtract the medical insurance later.\n\nMark J.

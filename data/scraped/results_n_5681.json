    "title": "If my 50/50 business partner won't take a buy out, and the relationship is bad, what can I do once I resign?",
    "question": "I bought all of the equipment on my personal credit cards. We owe the about $70k to my parents for start up costs. It's well documented, but we have nothing in writing about payment back. Can I resign from the business, take what is mine, and start over, since she won't consider a buy out, and I can not work with her forever. What is the best option for me? Of course I would love to have the business myself and continue to grow it, but she won't give it up, and I can not work with her anymore. Am I allowed to contact clients after since we don't have a non-compete?",

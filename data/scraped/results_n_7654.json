        "You cannot ask the court to extend your time to respond to interrogatory and other discovery requests. If you are going to file BK you might as well file so you stop this case and the efforts you are making to defend yourself.",
        "At a Case Management Conference, the court is primarily concerned with whether a trial date can be set, and whether the case can be referred to mediation. The fact that you might be filing for bankruptcy should not affect setting the trial date, but may affect the decision of whether mediation is appropriate.\n\nDid you file a Case Management Statement yourself? That would be where you inform the court that the plaintiff DID NOT meet and confer as required under Rule 3.724.",
        "You need to file a Case Management Statement with the court ASAP. http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/cm110.pdf You can explain your plans in the CMS. The primary purpose for the hearing will be to set a trial date. I agree with other counsel you can ask the court to continue the case management hearing to another date. The court does not have the authority to grant an extension of time to file your discovery responses; only plaintiff Credit Card Company (or its counsel) has the authority. If plaintiff does not agree to an extension of time, you should mail your discovery responses to plaintiff on time (30 days if plaintiff personally served them on you or 35 days if plaintiff mailed them to you) to preserve your rights; after all, you cannot be assured the bankruptcy filing will go smoothly.",
        "It is very good and commendable that you are trying to ready yourself for the hearing the best you can but if you are filing for bankruptcy, it won't be necessary to go through all the steps you would if you were to defend yourself against the action. They will ask you what you plan on doing in the way of discovery, witnesses, and availabiity for a trial. If you inform the court that you will be filing for bankruptcy, the conference might be continued on condition that you report back at a particular time with a list of all evidence and witnesses in the event that you don't file bankruptcy."

        "This is true in many situations where the person filing bankruptcy owes money to their bank or credit union. I have not heard of it happening in a case where money was not owed to the banking institution. It is usually a bad idea to bank with your creditor if you are going to file bankruptcy because the creditor bank may exercise the \"right to setoff\", meaning they will freeze the account and any funds in the account as of the day your bankruptcy is filed can be applied to the debt you owe them - even though the debt you owe them may be discharged in your bankruptcy. Also, there are some banks that are known for freezing accounts upon the filing of a bankruptcy by one of their account holders, even though the accountholder did not owe them money, on the grounds that money in the account is \"property of the bankruptcy estate\". They will normally release the hold once the bankruptcy trustee sends them a letter stating the bankruptcy estate has no interest in the funds. There is at least one major bank who does this regularly in bankruptcy cases, and there may be others. A bankruptcy attorney can advise you of the specifics. To avoid banking with your creditors while in bankruptcy, you can open an account with a non-creditor bank (a bank you do not owe money to) prior to filing. Be sure to disclose the new bank account in your bankruptcy paperwork to be filed with the court.",
        "The answer to your question is, as is true with most legal questions, \"It depends.\" Here, it depends on the terms under which the bank account is held open. I actually have never seen a bank close out an individual's account because the owner of the account files bankruptcy.\n\nHowever, if the bank does close out a bankrupt debtor's account and send a check, that debtor informs the bankruptcy trustee of the bank's action and gets permission from the trustee to open a new bank account with that check. S/He then takes the check to another bank, opens another account, and conducts business as usual. That assumes the bankruptcy petition is still open. If the petition is closed, the debtor can skip getting the trustee's permission."

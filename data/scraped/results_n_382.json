    "answers": [
        "Wife may have a potential community property interset in the equity aquired during the marriage, regarless of who's name is on title. She needs to consult with a bankruptcy lawyer to determine if homestaed exemption should be taken.",
        "I agree that your townhouse would be safe, primarily because it would not be part of her bankruptcy estate. The only (unlikely) argument a Trustee might attempt is to say that whatever portion of the principal mortgage balance that has been paid down during the marriage is community property and she would be entitled to half. But that is likely to be exemptable in any case.",
        "Based on the facts you provide, I believe the townhouse is safe. That said, remember, BK is more than checking boxes on forms you find online.

If you don't get a prompt call back from one, go on to the next on your list. Some of us offer a free consultation by phone or in person.

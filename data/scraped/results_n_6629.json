We are currently going through a divorce and have been married for 3 years we have no children, no home, no debts, no land absolutely nothing together. she believes that I have cheated on her, but she has no proof, she says she has texts messages and emails. but is that proof that will hold up in court?

        "Without knowing what income she has and what income you have, it is hard to say rather or not you are paying too little, too much or just right. Otherwise, as the others stated, best that you consult with a local family law attorney to where you live to determine exactly what your expectations are based upon a complete fact pattern. Good luck!",
        "You are not going to know until you file. You should contact an attorney in your area directly to discuss your case and moving forward.",
        "Excuse the expression. Bite the bullet and get it over with. File for divorce. You will have to pay spousal support for a period of time, likely about 18 months (1/2 the length of the marriage). It does not matter what \"evidence\" she has against you. California is a no fault state. You do not have to prove or not prove someone had an affair or anything else. It will be irrelevant in court. The only basis for divorce is irreconcilable differences and only one person has to ask for a divorce, the other does not have to agree. I do not know your pay level but $1000 may be high. Spousal support is based on your income and her income and some other items that likely you do not have (property taxes, mortgage interest, etc.). First, see you JAG officer. Second, if he cannot help, find a local attorney and have a consultation ASAP. There are attorneys like myself who give active military discounts but you need someone in the county in which you are living. Good luck."

    "title": "Can a debtor object to a \"transfer of claim other than for security\"?",
    "question": "I checked the docket of my Chapter 13 bankruptcy case and there is a transfer of claim filed for a junior lienholder on my residence pursuant to 11 USC 1111(a), and rule 3001(e)(2), FRBP. I have already filed a Motion to Strip the Lien and served the junior lienholder and there was no opposition. I already filed a request for default, but the orders have not yet been signed by the judge. Now strangely, it appears that the junior lienholder sold a completely unsecured second mortgage to another party. Can I as a debtor object to this transfer of claim? The deadline for filing proofs of claim was May 18, 2011. The court clerk did not mail me a copy of this transfer, thus my inquiry on whether I can object.",

        "Your focus should remain on stripping the lien and treating the claim as unsecured. Whoever gets the pennies on the dollar that your plan proposes to pay the unsecured creditors is irrelevant in my view and arguably should be the same for you. Who received the ultimate dividend is inconsequential what is critically important is that when you have completed all plan payments the lien is stripped.",
        "You are concerned your second mortgage has been stripped (removed) through chapter 13 but now the lender has transferred the claim to another entity, right? It's very common for lenders once they lose their mortgage rights to sell their claims to another entity (for almost nothing) but you do not need to worry about that. It will be discharged once you complete chapter 13 regardless of who they sell it to.",
        "You have no basis to object. Unsecured claims are transferred all the time. That should not affect your ability to vacate the lien because that is on file in the records of the county. Once vacated the debt is unsecured, but still exists.",
        "Would'nt you prefer a jmt/order stripping the lien?\n\nTransfers of claims are routine: be more concerned about felling the tree then worrying about the acorns."

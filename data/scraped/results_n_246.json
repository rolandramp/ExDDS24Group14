        "Congratulations on getting your plan filed and confirmed. If you've only got 10 months to go, you have received semi-annual reports from the Chapter 13 trustee. These reports give you an accounting of your plan payments. If you lost them or didn't understand what they were, you can go on the trustee's website, enter your case number and printout the reports.",
        "Do you have an attorney representing you in the chapter 13? If so, contact the attorney for more information. You should be receiving a report from the chapter 13 Trustee that shows how the money has been distributed to creditors. It is titled \"Trustee's Six month report of receipts and disbursements.\" The Trustee mails it to you (the debtor in the case) and your attorney, if you have one. It also shows the claim amount for each creditor and the balance due for each creditor. Not sure what you are asking: \"where does the money go?\" Money received from you for the plan payments to the Trustee who then pays the creditors and the Trustee also receives an administrative expense paid to the Trustee.",
        "To add to the answers provided by my colleagues: Generally, you Plan payments will be applied based on the classification of your debts - Class 1, Class 2, Class 3, Class 4, Class 5, etc. Your district may have a different classification for debts but there is a priority in which the debts are paid off. Any additional monies you are paying to your Plan will likely be going to the next class of creditors. At this point, this may be payment of a percentage to your general unsecured creditor claims.",
        "You should be asking your attorney this question. Without knowing your plan, we can only speak in generalities. In general, your payments go to pay administrative costs (the Trustee, your attorney etc,) your secured creditors (usually a specific amount each month) your priority creditors (taxes etc,) and the remainder, if any, is shared among the unsecured creditors on a prorated basis. If your \"largest creditors\" consist of your secured or administrative creditors, then it's likely your unsecured creditors are now receiving larger amounts each month until the end of your plan.\nAs stated by Ms. Miller above, you should be getting an annual or biannual report from the trustee that indicates who has been paid and how much. Your trustee may also have a website that you can log into that can also show you that information.",
        "I agree with Ms. Miller above. In general, the secured creditors (physical things like a house and a car) are paid dollar for dollar, if you kept them, and the rest of the creditors basically get whatever is left over (after the Court, the Trustee and your attorney are paid), so that is where the remainder is going until your case is over."

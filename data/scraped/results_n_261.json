    "question": "Am I eligible for filing chapter 7 bankruptcy if I can't afford to pay back credit card cash advances of 60K and have no real property except for a few thousands in my bank account and a car? My business loss contributed to this inability to pay back. Thanks.",

        "\"Can't afford to pay\" is a very subjective assessment. I use some very objective criteria including \"how much is left in your budget after paying necessary living expenses?\" How do you define \"necessary living expenses?\" That judgment call is important. Just because you are eligible does not mean that bankruptcy is your best option. So your question has a lot of moving parts, which makes answering it in an online forum problematic. Hope this perspective helps!",
        "I agree with my colleagues, it seems you may be a good candidate for a Chapter 7. It is a very good idea to speak with an experienced bankruptcy attorney and hire one you are comfortable with for your case. You want to make sure everything is done correctly the first time around - including making sure all of your assets are protected and that your income does not disqualify you for a Chapter 7. The case usually goes very smoothly when everything is done correctly.",
        "In addition to the above answers. For Chapter 7, you would also have to pass the \"means test\" which is essential checking whether your immediately previous 6 months of gross income is below a certain median income threshold for your household size and state in which you live in. The number that applies to you is publicly posted on the United States Trustee website. However, a quick consult with an attorney can determine your qualifications.",
        "These facts are a good start to analyze if chapter 7 bankruptcy protection will be a strong option for you. You’ll need a more detailed analysis to sort through additional details before knowing with more certainty about your eligibility and any possible tension points of seeking relief from your debt under the bankruptcy code. For instance, treatment of pre bankruptcy cash advances can be tricky. Business losses? May be helpful to your case, but also brings into question business value and it’s assets, depending on if a sole proprietorship/dba or a separate legal entity corporation or LLC.\n\nA bankruptcy consultation from an experienced bankruptcy lawyer will help your sort out these finer points and more.\n\nBest of luck and stay healthy",

        "I agree with the previous answer but to supplement her answer it may also be a good idea to find out the extent of your liability for the shared debts. If he has bad credit and is becoming delinquent on everything, he may be facing litigation from several debt collectors. If you are also liable for these financial obligations they may sue you too, and worse they may be able to collect the full amount of the debt from you. It is important to consult with your divorce attorney sooner rather than later to find out your options, and you may also ask if you should also consult with a firm that handles debt settlement and negotiation.",
        "We see the issue of adverse credit reporting based upon an ex's actions on a shared account often. As an initial matter, I would suggest that you consult with your divorce attorney. It's not clear from your inquiry who was responsible for payment of the vehicle loan pursuant to the divorce decree/settlement agreement.\n\nIf the court ordered your ex to make the payment, it is important to understand that this fact does not change your legal liability to to the lender. They can still take action to collect from you and report about you to the credit bureaus pursuant to your agreement with them. BUT you may be able to move the court to hold your ex in contempt if he is not complying with an order of the court. The court's willingness to do so varies by jurisdiction, it seems, but here in Ohio, our local judges are generally supportive of a motion for contempt. Again, your divorce attorney is the best contact for you to explore a contempt action.\n\nGenerally a secured creditor (i.e., the lender) causes a repossession. It's unclear from your inquiry upon what basis you would have legal grounds to do so, but, again, I would start with speaking to your divorce attorney.\n\nGood luck to you! I know it's challenging and being pro-active to protect your credit standing, as you are, is certainly a step in the right direction."

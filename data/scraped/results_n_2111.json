        "Your should seek the assistance of bankruptcy counsel before being too dismissive. A thorough review of the judgment is required. As for your debtor's exam, Gould should have counsel.",
        "At a debtor's exam you will have to provide your social security number. Don't be so sure you can't file a bankruptcy. The fact that the judgment was entered by default means the issue was never really adjudicated. A bankruptcy judge may not think your actions are fraud. You should at least get a consultation from a bankruptcy attorney before you rule it out.",
        "Typical questions asked during your debtor's exam is driver license number, social security number, any real property you own, any personal property you own, bank accounts, vehicles, etc.\n\nSo yes.\n\nAs far as the fraud judgment is concerned, if it was taken by default, was there a proper prove-up hearing? California has strict rules about defaults. Judges are supposed to be very skeptical about defaults and have a duty to inquire about a number of issues. So filing declarations are usually not enough because fraud has to be proved with specificity and also damages have to be quantified usually through a trial on damages unless there is a basis to award it otherwise.\n\nI would strongly suggest you retain a debt collection defense lawyer in your area. Also, a Ch. 13 can result in the discharge of a fraud judgment."

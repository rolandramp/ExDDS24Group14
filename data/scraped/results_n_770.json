        "Agree with the other attorneys. If you received a Chapter 7 discharge in July 2010 you can file 8 years and a day after the filing date of that initial petition roughly April 2018. You may be able to hire an attorney to negotiate on your behalf on the unsecured debt and in some cases even obtain a forgiveness of certain medical debts. Good luck.",
        "I agree with my colleagues.\nYou would be entitled to a discharge of the debts you are unable to pay in a Chapter 13 filed now ... but that may not make a lot of sense (since it is considerably more expensive) if your medical debts are minimal.",
        "If a debtor filed a prior bankruptcy and received a discharge in that bankruptcy case, then the limitation on filing is from filing date. A debtor can file a new case any time, but he/she cannot receive discharge unless the time period between filings complies with the bankruptcy code.

        "To your question, If you have already received a discharge in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy, than you must wait eight years from the date you filed the previous case before you can file another Chapter 7 and receive a discharge (See Bankruptcy Code ยง 727(a)(8)).\n\nIf this debt is the only debt that you have, than you may wish to consider other alternatives to chapter 7 bankruptcy.

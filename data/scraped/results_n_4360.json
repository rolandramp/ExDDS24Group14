    "title": "Do active-duty military members have to show up in small claims court?",
    "question": "I am taking an active duty military member, in the Navy, to small claims court because he owes me a lump sum of money and will not pay back. Our court date is on December 3, 2013... If he does not show up, am I out of luck since he is military? I have heard differences in opinion, about whether military members have to show up and whether the court is allowed to garnish their wages or not.",
    "answers": [
        "If he is trying to play games, you may need to contact the Navy. Judgments and bad debts affect an individual's security clearance and ultimately military membership.",
        "Being in the military is not a defense to being sued.\n\nYou may gave a hoop or two to jump through (proper service; await deployment termination), but you will get your day in court.\n\nIf he no shows, doesn't answer, and isn't deployed, TAD, you can, if you have done your homework, get a default judgment against him.",
        "You raise a very good question. The simple answer is that if a service member is properly served and given notice of the court date, he must show and answer the complaint. However, if the service member's duty materially effects his ability to appear, he can invoke his rights under the Servicemembers' Civil Relief Act (SCRA) and request a stay of the case until such time as he can properly answer. Material Effect could mean a deployment, a training exercise, or leave not granted by the Commanding Officer. If you know that the opposing party is a member of the armed services on active duty, the Court may NOT enter a default judgment against him.\n\nRegarding garnishment.... If you eventually do get a judgment against him, you cannot garnish his wages through the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS). DFAS only does garnishment orders for child support, spousal support, and associated attorney fees. However, there may be other remedies available to you (after you get the judgment), such as a bank levy, etc.\n\nBest of luck to you."

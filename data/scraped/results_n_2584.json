    "title": "If I cosigned a student loan and the main signer has stopped paying the loan do i have any legal recourse to stop harassment?",
    "question": "I am being harassed by the Institution holding the loan with letters and phone calls. I have been told by them that my credit and wages are at risk and that I may face other repercussions if the loan is not paid in full.",
    "answers": [
        "You agreed to be as liable as the original borrower. They can send letters and call you as long as it doesn't violate any federal of California debt collection law. Your credit and wages are at risk. You would be wise to consult an attorney to see if you can settle the matter as a student loan is unlikely to go away.",
        "You can pay the debt. It is your debt. You can sue the person for whom you co-signed. When you recover the money from the other person and pay off the loan, the harassment will stop. If you do not think that you can collect from that person, that is why you were asked to co-sign.\n\nYou cannot discharge a student loan debt in bankruptcy. They can garnish your wages, intercept your income tax refunds, take your social security when you retire and add interest to the debt.\n\nThere are some programs that might help you, but you need to meet with a student loan specialist.",
        "As a co-signer on the loan, you agreed to be on the hook for the loan if the primary borrower does not pay. So now, that agreement has you on the hook. You can set up payments or you can wait until you are compelled to make payments. Sorry the primary has bailed and left you holding the payment due slip.",
        "You can always ask the lender not to call, and if the caller is an agent of the lender, you have rights to sue the agent for violation of collection laws, if you follow the property protocol. More info below. But when people use the term \"harassment,\" I always wonder what they mean. It does you no good to overstate your case to a group of volunteer experts on this topic. You co-signed a debt and the lender does have a right to call you to demand payment, sue you to collect, and garnish your wages once a court judgment is entered. If the loan is a federal loan, the creditor, like the IRS, does not need to sue you. A federal creditor can simply garnish your wages, attach your bank account and intercept your tax refund. And without saying a word, the creditor can slam your credit. So would you rather be warned or have this hit you out of the blue? Hope this perspective helps!",
        "The creditor is entitled to communicate with you regarding the debt you own them.\n\nWhether they are harassing you in legal terms, is unclear (despite your assertion that they are). Chat with a CA debt attorney who can identify if they are stepping outside the bounds of your state's laws or the FDCPA."

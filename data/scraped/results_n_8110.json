    "title": "What is the foreclosure timeline in CA with BofA after chapter 7 discharge?",
    "question": "I filed BK in October of 2008 and my debts, including my 1st and 2nd mortgage, were discharged in February of 2009. I did NOT reaffirm my mortgage but continued to pay the 1st because I intended to keep the house. After an unsuccessful year long loan modification attempt with BofA, I decided to stop paying my mortgage in September of 2010. My understanding is that since the loan was discharged under chapter 7 BK, BofA cannot come after me for any deficiency, but they can proceed with foreclosure.",

        "1) Yes, you will be mailed a Notice of Default as the first procedural step for the bank to foreclose. The BK, once discharged, does not affect the non-judicial foreclosure process as it is for sale of the property and not against you personally. After the Notice of Default is filed, the bank must wait 90 days before filing a Notice of Trustee's Sale. The date of the sale can be no sooner than 21 days from the date of recording of the Notice of Trustee's Sale.\n2) After the sale, the new owner (bank or investor) will have to serve you with a 3-day notice to vacate. If you do not vacate, the new owner will file an unlawful detainer lawsuit (UD) for eviction. Depending on how fast the bank's attorneys move on it and how much you litigate, or not, the Sheriff could execute on a writ of possession as soon as 28 - 30 days after the bank files the UD.\n\nThat's theory - in the real world right now, big banks are usually taking anywhere from 6 months to a year to complete the foreclosure, and the eviction process wil take another 2 - 3 months, sometimes longer.\n\nRichard A. Rodgers, Esq. (805) 230-2525\nrar@sd-attorneys.com\nwww.sdresq.com\n\nAs stated in the AVVO.COM Terms and Conditions of Use, this answer is not intended as legal advice, and no attorney-client relationship or privilege is created by this response.",
        "Your understanding is correct. I agree with Attorney Rodgers' response.\n\nThe next step is to await the bank's Notice of Default, but as Attorney Rodgers indicates, in the real world the time to complete a non-judicial foreclosure and then the eviction thereafter is getting much longer.",
        "Unless the mortgage lien was avoided in the Ch. 7, it remains. Talk to your original bankruptcy lawyer about how this works.\n\nAnd you will receive notice of default because it is the default on the obligation that triggers the rights under the deed of trust. The lender must follow the terms of the document and CA foreclosure procedure."

        "Your attorney would have a better idea, but even he can only give you a ball park. Even if we knew what the settlement agreement entailed and what it resolved, we can't really tell you how long a trustee will take: it takes as long as it takes. Most trustees move as quickly as possible, but they also don't rubber stamp, so it may be a few days, a few weeks, maybe even up to a month, depending upon what is being resolved.",
        "There is no specific answer to your question. The time frame will depend on what documents the trustee is reviewing? Is it the settlement agreement? Some trustees may do this quickly, others who are busier may take longer. You will likely just have to wait for the trustee to complete their review, however long that takes."

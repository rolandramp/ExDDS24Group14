        "You cannot file a Chapter 13 until 4 years have passed from your Chapter 7 Discharge. If you are thinking of filing a Chapter 13, you might be better off converting to a Chapter 13 now before you obtain your Chapter 7 discharge. Of course, this really depends on a myriad of decisions and factors. You cannot restructure your loan in a Chapter 13 (unless the lender agrees). So you are pretty much back to where you were before. All that a Chapter 13 does is allow you 3-5 years to make up past due mortgage payments.

    "title": "Fraudulent transfer and preference claims in Chapter 13?",
    "question": "Can a trustee pursue a fraudulent transfer or preference payment claim in Chapter 13? Or are those types of claims limited to Chapter 7 trustees? If can pursue in Chapter 13, how likely is that a Chapter 13 trustee would pursue such claims?",
    "answers": [
        "I agree with the other attorney answers and would add that the goal of the ch. 13 trustee is to get as much money to pay back the creditors, which they represent. The trustees also earn a commission based upon how much is paid back so they have a financial incentive to increase the money coming into the bankruptcy estate. With this in mind, the trustee may pursue the transfers or preferences if they are worth pursuing for the benefit of the estate.",
        "A lot of other issues and facts go into answering this . For example, where does the other person live..what state or country..What if the other person threatens to file bankruptcy or in fact does. What if the claim is small vs % of claims allowed and to be paid. Some trustee's try to get debtor's in our state of Washington to include in the plan inclusion of the payment or value of the possible recovery in the plan so they don't proceed to try and enforce it too. Great question.",
        "As a practical matter, if the Chapter 13 plan pays 100% to the unsecured creditors, the trustee wouldn't be interested in pursuing any fraudulent transfers. If the plan pays less than 100%, then the trustee will chase the fraudulent transfers and preferences.",
        "Yes, a Chapter 13 Trustee can pursue a fraudulent transfer or preferential payment. The likelihood would be based on the benefit to the bankruptcy estate. If the chapter 13 plan provides for 100% payback to general unsecured creditors, it is less likely that an avoidance of transfer would take place. However, if the chapter 13 plan provides for a 10% repayment, it would be more likely that the trustee would file some type of adversary proceeding. The amount of money is question may also impact the decision of the Trustee. A preferential payment of $1,500, less likely. A preference of $15,000, more likely."

    "title": "Hi, I am being sued for 4k indicating that back in Oct 2008 I used the hospital services and did not pay. Will I lose?",
    "question": "I was insured through hospital program from 2008-2010 because I was unemployed; however they claim only for the month of Oct 2008 I was not insured and I owe them 4k for the services they provided on Oct 27,2008. My point is if I was not insured and since I am insured through their program why they did not tell me so that I can re-schedule my appointment to following week? Can they win in court? Can they contact my current employer? I need help. Thank you!",

        "If they sued you before October 27, 2008, then you do not have the affirmative defense of Statute of limitations. depending on your financial situation you may wish to have an attorney negotiate a settlement with them. If you have a lot of debts tell your attorney that and this may work on your favor. I have always been successful in bringing down the amount to half or below when settling with these collectors. I always prefer 35-40 cents for settlement. Best of luck.",
        "There are 2 related issues: whether you were covered by an insurance policy or government program such as MediCal, and whether you owe the hospital for services.\n\nAssuming that you were NOT covered by any insurance policy, and you were not approved for MediCal coverage when you were treated, then most likely you are responsible for the bill. A public hospital cannot refuse to treat you due to having no insurance, so the hospital or health care provider would not advise you to reschedule your appointments for a later date, when you will or may have coverage.\n\nVery often a patient who owes a medical bill can make payments towards what he or she owes. But hospitals and health care providers will eventually refer an unpaid bill to a collection agent, and may in some cases file a lawsuit to collect the debt. Whether they \"win in court\" depends on whether they have credible evidence, whether you oppose the lawsuit, and whether you can dispute the evidence and/or assert any defenses.\n\nYou may want to talk to a debt collection defense attorney to get more information about your options."

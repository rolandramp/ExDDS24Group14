        "Legal representative, executor, personal representative are all terms that refer to an individual who is appointed by the Probate court to take charge of administering someone's estate. This person is not necessarily a beneficiary of the estate. The executor must still comply with any instructions left in the decedent's Will about how assets are to be distributed to the beneficiaries. If there was no Will, the beneficiaries will be determined by the State's default rules under the Intestate Succession Statute. Generally, spouses are first in line to inherit any community property and a portion of the separate property. If there is no spouse, then children are next in line.

        "I agree with Attorney Steingraber. Thus, call and meet an attorney now..several right here on AVVO with great knowledge they have demonstrated for years on their answers to questions. But other issues and facts also exist possibly that could affect your case I will point out below so you know to call an attorney. How fast? I promise my clients I have done in 2 business day after delivery of all on my checklist. Most attorneys do not promise that though and might take a week..but you will ask them.\n\nYou need and want to enjoy your fresh start also. But the most important thing is to meet with an attorney as you asking this question means you have not. You care about 2 goals: keeping everything you have equity in and discharging all your debts. If you don't have any of the exceptions to discharge you will obtain that goal; most exceptions are set forth in 11 USC. 523 (Google it) like child support, some income taxes, traffic (in a ch 7) and criminal fines , and presumption of student loans. But some debts are dischargeable in a ch 13 but NOT in a ch 7 so you want to make sure and your attorney will discuss any such types with you also!\n\nYour exemptions depend on what state you have lived in in the last 2 years and thus if in your state, then your states exemptions will apply. Most persons filing keep everything they own but your attorney will confirm that with you when they learn everything you own and the equity thereof!\n\nSome secured debts like homes, vehicles, other secured debts an attorney will discuss your options on also as you must list any debts; but that does not mean you will lose them unless you have too much equity or are in default on paying for them! Discuss those options if they apply with your attorney too.\n\nBut other issues can arise that can greatly harm your case. Just one example: If you paid back a relative $3,000 11 months ago and now file bankruptcy next week, the trustee can SUE that relative to retrieve that $3,000 (under what is called a preference) for the benefit of the bankruptcy estate. As a result, most attorneys don't charge to meet with them the first meeting so meet with one no matter what.\n\nMany great attorneys can be found right here on AVVO in your state so look, call, and meet one as soon as you can.\n\nYou should also want to know when to file: is there an advantage of waiting versus filing now and who should you pay between now and then! Good luck and enjoy your later fresh start.\n1",
        "Regarding the BK: An emergency petition can be filed immediately. But, that may not be necessary because even if your bank account/wages are levied, those funds can be recovered in the bankruptcy process up to 90 days after the levy if they are properly exempted. That said, BK is not a DIY project consisting of checking boxes on forms you find on-line. Find/consult/hire an Avvo BK lawyer by using the \"Find a Lawyer\" feature. Make a list consisting of several BK lawyers having many 5 star reviews from satisfied clients. If you don't get a prompt call back, go on to the next one on your list. Some of us offer a free consultation by phone or in person. Take us up on it. If this answer was helpful, please leave your feedback on the Avvo website as “best answer or helpful”.

    "title": "How long can a collection agency attempt to collect a credit card debt in California-last payment was made in 2007",
    "question": "The debt was last paid on in 2007, the debt was on a credit card in my name. My husband filed chapter 7 and I was a non filing spouse, however the debt was listed on the Chapter 7 and it was discharged under his filing in 2010. The collection agency is contacting me to pay this debt and have also contacted my EX spouse who is NOT related to this debt (We divorced in 2004) and have left messages on his fiance's phone in attempt to reach me. How long does this go on and can they legally contact anyone they want on this?",

    "answers": [
        "Voluntary payment can be pursued. Statue of limitation is a defense if they attempt collection by lawsuit. You remain liable for this debt because you did not file with husband and did not receive discharge. As far as ex-h goes, he can send letter to agency stating he disputes this debt and unless they can prove his obligation, they better stop calling him or they'll be in violation of fair debt collection act and rosenthall act. You can also send written request to cease and desist telephone calls to you or third parties. Send it certified mail so you have proof in case they keep calling after that",
        "The law you need to be aware of is the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and also know that most states have consumer protection laws that can protect you as well. If you have not made any payments on this debt in over four years, then the collection agency cannot resurrect this claim against you and the actions they are taking violate the law.\n\nSeek out a lawyer familiar with the FDCPA and collection laws in your area to assist you -- and do so with confidence as the FDCPA provides for payment of your attorneys fees and costs in the event you prevail in a suit.",
        "This is the risk you run when married couples do not file a joint petition. Your ex-husbands bankruptcy was an individual filing so it only discharged debts as to him, not to you. As the non-filiing spouse you are still legally responsible for all debts in your name. The collection comapny cannot persue your ex-husband without violating his discharge but they can collect against you because you are not protected by your ex-husbands bankurptcy. The debt was only discharged as to him. Your ex may be able to get sanctions against the collection company for contacthing him and is fiancee, however they are legally allowed to collect against you unless you also file a bankruptcy.",
        "The statute is generally 4 years from the date of last payment or charge."

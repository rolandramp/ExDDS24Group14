    "title": "Can I successfully object to personal jurisdiction after making special appearances on grounds of inconvenient forum motion?",
    "question": "I am a DC resident and was served with a divorce petition in CA. I filed a motion to dismiss and strike on the grounds of inconvenient forum and judicial estoppel. Subsequently, my wife was deemed served with a DC divorce complaint in a DC child support hearing. That DC complaint was dismissed twice for lack of personal jurisdiction (limited immunity under UIFSA) and subject matter jurisdiction. I am appealing that ruling, but my FNC motion may not be granted. Can I still challenge personal jurisdiction?",

        "No. DC would have no jurisdiction over this matter, as explained.",
        "As long as your wife has residence here in CA and during the marriage the two of you lived here and/or the marriage was performed here in CA, CA can exercise personal jurisdiction on the status of the marriage and subject matter jurisdiction on the status of the marriage and can also exercise jurisdiction on the division of the estate's assets and debts. As to child custody/visitation/support matters that could be left to be determined by the courts. On that issue, you could file motions in DC on the matter of child custody/visitation, child support and then the courts would have to decide which forum would be best to handle the these matters. Usually the home state of the children wins out. I suggest that you cut your losses and look at getting the matters done here in CA. I do not believe you will prevail on the inconvenient form and judicial estoppel motion. My office can help.",
        "It is possible that the motions you filed could have resulted in your coming within the CA court's jurisdiction. To know for sure, someone will have to review your pleadings.\nFind a local family law attorney for a consultation.\nSince family law proceedings differ from typical civil cases I am going to edit your post so family law attorneys see it."

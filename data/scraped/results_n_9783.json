        "Your question is very unclear. It sounds like your mother wants to transfer a \"partial interest\" in her property to you. A partial interest is anything that is less than the entire interest (so anywhere from 0.000001% to 99.999999%).\n\nBut why is she thinking about doing this? Without more information it's impossible to know what she perceives to be an advantage.\n\nIf your credit is bad, then there is a distinct possibility that your creditors would try to place a lien on your mother's property (or to be precise on your interest in your mother's property). If you mother wants to give you an interest in the property, she would be far wiser to do so by placing the gift to you in a \"spendthrift\" trust that would help insulate you from creditors' claims.\n\nThis information is not intended to substitute for professional legal advice and does not create an attorney-client relationship. You should accept legal advice only from a licensed legal professional with whom you have an attorney-client relationship."

        "Yes, you can do both. However, the process for getting and enforcing a writ of execution against a primary residence requires court approval. You will need to pay for an appraisal of the property and do a thorough title search. The debtor has an automatic homestead exemption. The amount of the homestead exemption depends upon the size of the family, age and any disability. If the home is worth (at an auction sale, where the home is sold \"as is\", all cash and without any warranty to title, is $500,000, if there is a $350,000 mortgage along with someone's else's abstract of judgment for $25,000, and if the applicable exemption is $125,000, you will net exactly zero from the process and you will be out all of the expenses incurred in doing an appraisal, legal fees, etc.",
        "Yes, but unless they know that they'll get paid by forcing a sale, they will probably only put a lien on the property. And, yes, they can pursue a garnishment at the same time, as well as try to levy any other non-exempt assets, like bank accounts.",
        "When a creditor has a judgment against a debtor, the creditor can force a sale of the debtor's real property but that's a relatively expensive process. It's usually only done in cases where the judgment is large (e.g., over $100,000) and where there is equity in the property. There are many large judgments out there these days but not many homes with sufficient equity.\n\nA creditor can levy on a debtor's bank accounts with a Writ of Execution AND at the same time garnish a debtor's wages. It's not an either/or situation. Both remedies can be pursued together. A creditor can also put a lien on a debtor's real property and, where appropriate, on personal property.\n\nBut as I said at the top, these remedies are available to a creditor only if he/she has a judgment. Those remedies are not available in cases where the creditor is merely trying to collect an overdue bill."

        "This is a treacherous area of law. Sales taxes can be discharged under certain circumstances. It depends in part on whether the tax is considered an excise tax, a tax measured by gross receipts, or a trust fund tax. If it is either of the first two, it can be discharged if it is more than 3 years since the returns was last due to be filed, and over 2 years since the return(s) for the periods in question were actually filed. There's a few more requirements, but that's the basic test.\n\nIf it is a trust fund tax, then it is never dischargeable. Determining which of the above the tax is depends in part on state law, and how the debt was incurred.. For example, if you collected the tax from the customers as part of your transaction, but didn't turn it over to the board of equalization, they will most likely consider it a trust fund tax; otherwise, it would likely be considered an excise tax or tax measured by gross receipts.\n\nYou definitely need an attorney to analyze your specific facts.\n\nMark J.

    "title": "How to enforce HOA dues against active duty military member stationed in the states?",
    "question": "Active duty military member is stationed in WA. Condo is in CA. He has failed to pay dues since January. How can I enforce? Filing a lien now, but can't push for foreclosure so long as he's active duty? If I file Small Claims case and get a money judgment, I'd be able to apply for an involuntary allotment? But then he could vacate the judgment because he is active duty? It seems the HOA has no recourse! Any guidance?",
    "answers": [
        "You should get a military attorney who can assist you in obtaining the money from the Servicemember. Each Servicemember has a duty to pay all valid debts. If they do not, it may affect their military career and you can get the money directly from the military before it hits his or her bank account. Failing to pay debts is punishable under the UCMJ. My recommendation, generally, in cases like this, is to get an attorney to write a demand letter to this Servicemember and otherwise work this through his or her chain of command. Most likely he or she will set up a payment plan so you do not have to go through lengthly and expensive litigation. This is not legal advice. If you seek legal advice, contact an attorney.",
        "Asker- You can sue active duty. You are not correct that the SCRA protects ANY active duty military at ALL times. It only protects those whose \"military service materially affects the ability of a servicemember to meet or attend to civil matters\".",
        "Unfortunately while they are active there is nothing that can be done. This is a protection that the US gives them to allow them to focus on their duty abroad."

    "title": "What happens when in a 2 person partnership, the penultimate partner leaves but the remaining partner wants to continue?",
    "question": "A 2 person partnership operates in California, let's say one of the partners wants to leave or be bought out - the other partner has the ability and willingness to continue the business on his own. It's my understanding from reading the RUPA that there is no such thing as a one person partnership, so a buyout can not take place because there would be no partner, so the only step to take is to dissolve the partnership - but what if one of the partners wishes to continue the business? Is there something I'm missing or not connecting the dots? Can you transform it into a sole proprietorship?",
    "answers": [
        "In order to answer the question, I will need to see the partnership agreement as that document is likely to specify what is to be done. If there is no partnership agreement, each party may go their own way after the business debts and assets are apportioned.\n\nPlease feel free to contact me at (408) 796-9616 for a free consultation.",
        "Simply convert the partnership to an LLC (which can have one member) under state law which will be considered a tax free capital contribution from both partners to the LLC. You would then enter into a Membership Purchase Agreement with your co-member (LLC equivalent of a partner) to provide for the deal terms of the buy-out.",
        "I agree with my colleagues that the partnership may be over, but what happens next depends on a few things: local law and whether you had an operating agreement. If you had an operating agreement, you may have addressed what happens in the situation you described, including what happens to the name and assets of the company. If you had one, follow it. If you didn't, check out your local rules for dissolving a patnership.",
        "If the remaining partner wants to continue doing business they can do so as a sole proprietor. The partnership is over. Whatever agreement the two come to as far as assets and liabilities can be worked out amongst themselves but if the creditors are not paid the leaving partner will be sued.\n\nIf this is a real person and not a law student looking to get their homework done for them, you should consult with an attorney in your area.",
        "In a true \"general partnership\" you cannot have one partner. At the \"end\" of the partnership, the assets and liablities are distributed, paid or provided for. If one partner wishes to continue and the former partner does not object, after the distribution and payment, the remaining partner continues as a sole proprietorship or sets up a business entity."

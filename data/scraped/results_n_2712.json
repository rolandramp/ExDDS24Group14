    "title": "My ex wife took out loans in my name that went to default. What can I do?",
    "question": "Apparently my ex wife, after our separation and also after our divorce, took out loans in my name without my consent via online loan companies. The loans have gone to default. And a car she apparently put my name on has been repossessed and is marked as \"charged off\". What can I do? Do I have to pay fraudulent debts?",

        "That is fraud and forgery. You could open a civil action and a criminal action. As for the loans themselves, contact the company's looking to you for repayment, contest them, and show them your divorce judgment or marital settlement agreement and show how she was not your spouse and unauthorized to act as she did.",
        "If you didn't sign the loan documents and she did not have a power of attorney to do so on your behalf, then these loans would be faulty and you could avoid paying them.\n\nHowever, it is likely the loan companies have reported the debt as your and in default to credit reporting companies.\n\nYou should contact the loan companies and protest the loans and any link to you. You should also get a copy of your credit report and see what has been reported. If any of those loans have been reported, you should dispute them through the credit reporting companies formal dispute process.\n\nAlso, you should contact the police. These are financial crimes that they are taking more seriously. If you get the police involved, the loan and credit reporting companies are more likely to help you out.\n\nFinally, you could sue your ex-wife in state court. However, I'm not sure that is in your best interest at this time.\n\nYou should engage an attorney to discuss these and any other options you might have.\n\nJoshua Burt"

    "title": "Is it possible to hire an attorney to remove noncollectable debts from a credit report and make settlement offers to creditors?",
    "question": "Regarding personal, unsecured credit. I have a number of accounts that have had no activity for over 4 years and would like to remove them from my credit report. Secondly, I would like to offer a small amount in settlement for my remaining debts. Most are charged off. The simple truth is I cannot afford to pay the full amount but want to avoid bankruptcy for employment reasons. I am not interested in a payment plan or consolidation plan which seem to be the only alternatives offered by attorneys I have contacted.",

        "You say there has been no activity for over 4 years so this may render the debt uncollectible as the Statute of Limitation would expire (California). Be sure NOT to make any payment even a small one because that will restart the Statute and you may be stuck for the whole amount.\nAs far as the Credit report is concerned, take a good look to see if it accurtely reflects the name of the creditor, the amount of the debt, the last date of activity and other items. If it does not, send in a dispute for every item. Creditors are required to respond and if they do not, the debt has to be scrubbed from the records.\nMake sure to contact all credit reporting agencies and do the same with each.",
        "Yes you can certainly have an attorney dispute the old debts and make settlement offers on the valid debts. When you say that you would like to offer a small amount in settlement for the valid debts, of course it's up to the creditor to accept that, counter offer or outright deny it and seek recovery through alternate methods if they are not willing to settle that low. Their decision would depend on various factors, but generally you can expect some compromise on their end - they appreciate the fact that you are reaching out to resolve it. It is a smart move to be proactive on repairing your credit and settling valid debts.",

        "I'm a bit confused. You say the lien was \"cleared\". But that is not in the code. It sounds like it was discharged, but, no one filed a motion to avoid the lien, or did file a motion to avoid the lien and it was granted, and you just need a copy of the order.\n\nIf there was no motion to avoid the lien, then you will have to as the other attorneys answered, move to reopen the case and file a motion to avoid the lien, obtain an order and then you should show that to the escrow/title company.\n\nWithout more no one can help you at the moment.",
        "You need to either contact your bankruptcy attorney that handled your prior case or seek immediate advice from an experienced bankruptcy attorney in your area. There is no such thing as a letter of avoidance. Avoiding a lien (an action to remove a lien from property), requires a legal action to be filed in your bankruptcy case. If you have grounds to support such an action, you would have to reopen your bankruptcy case and then proceed. Depending upon the basis of the lien (judgment from a lawsuit or a second loan on your property which resulted in a voluntary lien) - you may or may not be able to avoid the lien.",
        "If the lien was created by the filing of an Abstract of Judgment before your bankruptcy was filed, you will need to reopend your old chapter 7 case and file a Motion to Avoid Lien. I strongly recommend that you retain an experienced bankruptcy attorney to handle this. If done correctly and quickly, you can obtain an Order Avoiding Lien that can then be recorded with teh county and the lien will be gone.\n\nThis is the only way to do this, there is no \"letter\" you can get, although the loan company may be calling it that. Get some help and this can be taken care of quickly.",

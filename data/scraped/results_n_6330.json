        "I agree with the others in that the actor is probably not an at-will employee of Paramount. You will likely have better fortune at collecting against the actor by garnishing bank accounts or looking for other assets to seize. Enforcement of a judgment can be tricky but there are some powerful tools that give the law real teeth here. Speak to an attorney who is experienced at collection of judgments.\nDisclaimer: This answer is not intended to be legal advice, it is given based on the information provided which is insufficient to give meaningful advice. There is no attorney client relationship created by this answer. The question writer should seek out legal advice for this inquiry.",
        "I think it's unlikely that an actor is actually employed by Paramount, but you could try.",
        "While I cannot give you legal advice in this forum, if the amount is significant, you should consider getting a collections attorney to do this for you. They will probably take 1/3 of what is collected but it is much more efficient that trying to do this yourself. For garnishments/levies the paperwork needs to be perfect to avoid issues.",
        "I doubt the actor is an \"employee\" of Paramount (if they are, a garnishment is correct). If they are owed money for services that are not \"wages,\" then you'd send a levy for non-earnings money owed."

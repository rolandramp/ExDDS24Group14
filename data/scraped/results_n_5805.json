    "title": "Judgment debtor has multiple bank accounts. Should/can I levy them all?",
    "question": "I won a large judgment in small claims court. I am going to file a Writ of Execution (EJ-130) and Notice of Levy (EJ-150). The debtor has several bank accounts that I am aware of, but I don't know the balances of any. Obviously, the best way to ensure maximum payment is to levy all of the accounts until the judgment is satisfied.",

        "Yes, it is possible to levy on all bank accounts at the same time. You do not need to prepare notices of levy (the sheriff's department does this for you). Attorney Ashabraner's response is correct.",
        "1. Identify the county in which debtor's bank account is located.\n2. Obtain one writ of execution for each county.\n3. For each BANK, send to that county's sheriff's department the following documents: (1) original writ of execution for that county plus 3 copies; (2) instructions to levy all bank accounts located AT THAT ONE BANK, and (3) a $30-35 levy fee (i.e., you'll have to pay a fee FOR EACH BANK). The sheriff's department website will explain which sheriff's department branch to use and its fee; look under Civil Service of Process on the website.\n4. If you mail documents to different sheriff's departments, then explain to each one who has the original writ of execution. The departments will need to ensure the amount collection from the various departments does not exceed the total amount due under the writ.",
        "In addition, to what Mr. Chen and Ms. Ashabraner have said, the sheriff will levy on each bank only once. To get the sheriff to go back, you must ask for another levy and pay another fee."

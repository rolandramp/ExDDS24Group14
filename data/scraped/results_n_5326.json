        "The answer used to be yes. Once a creditor became AWARE of a past bankruptcy, even if that creditor was not listed or was listed with an in correct address. I believe that the answer has changed to NO, based on recent Bankruptcy case decisions.\n\nThis means that notice is more important than ever in getting a discharge of your debts. There is time to add forgotten creditors or correct their mailing addresses while the bankruptcy case is going on. When a Court notice is returned to the Court because of a bad address, notice is given to you and to your lawyer. They should be corrected promptly. If you find debts after the bankruptcy has been discharged, the case must be re-opened to add the creditors. That can be expensive.",
        "Assuming your case is a no-asset case and the un-noticed creditors wouldn't have a basis to file an Adversary Proceeding to object to your discharge, all your dischargeable debts will be discharged. You don't need to worry about debts transferred to other collection agencies; but it doesn't hurt (except for the court fee) to amend your Schedule F to add an omitted creditor.",
        "If an address is wrong, the notice will be returned to the debtor's attorney, or if the debtor is representing himself, to the debtor. The case of In Re Beezley addresses the issue of an unlisted debt being discharged & finding this case online isn't very hard. Hope this perspective helps!",
        "If the case is ongoing, you might be able to amend the petition to correct any errors. If you already received a discharge, in most cases, you should have to worry about it if all of your property was exempted (and no property was liquidated). You should speak with your bankruptcy attorney to guide you through the process, and dispute any creditors still showing up on your credit report."

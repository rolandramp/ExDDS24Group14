        "Agree with colleagues. Need more facts to determine if BK will remove the writ of execution. Did you guarantee the debt? Personal BK will relieve you personally of personal liability. Personal BK will not relieve the company of liability. May be other options. Need more facts to opine. Consult BK counsel to review all facts and options.",
        "Bankruptcy may remove Writ of Execution, it depends on the basis for the company's lawsuit against you. A personal bankruptcy will not affect collection activities against a \"company\" unless that company is a sole proprietorship. I recommend consulting with an attorney or visiting www.dattalawgroup.com for more information regarding your question.",
        "You mentioned that your corporation is being sued. However, it not clear whether you are personally liable as well to the alleged underlined debt. Generally filing for bankruptcy will stay a writ of execution and all other collection actions. However, it is impossible to ascertain if bankruptcy is the right solution for you, without considering other factors, such as your assets, your other debts, the amount of the debts, the nature of the lawsuit you mentioned, etc.\nI strongly suggest that you consult with a local bankruptcy attorney in your area. Based on your particular facts the attorney will be able to provide you with specific analysis and recommendations. Most attorneys provide initial limited consultation for free.",
        "The first question to ask is was your old company a corporation, LLC or a sole proprietorship? When you say \"old company\" what happened to it? If the obligation was only against a corporation, and the corporation was dissolved properly that would resolve it. If, however, the company was a sole proprietorship then it would be one in the same with you personally. Carefully look at the Writ of Execution to see who the creditor is going after. Bankruptcy can forgive debts and essentially make a writ of execution go away but first we need to determine if bankruptcy is necessary.",
        "It depends. A personal bankruptcy will not affect collection activities against a \"company\" unless that company is a sole proprietorship.

        "Bankruptcy will stop the Writ of Execution in a civil case. Bankruptcy will probably discharge the debt making it uncollectable, but it doesn't remove the Writ, just makes it void. There is a difference between the two, but might not make any difference to you. A bankruptcy discharge could be denied regarding this debt if the creditor successfully files an Adversary Action under 11 USC sec 523. Probably not likely, but it could happen.\n\nAs to other options, they are settlement by agreement with the creditor or a motion to set aside the underlying judgment. Mr Smith of Ohio wrote a great article about settling debts and motions to set aside are always difficult. Hope this perspective helps!",

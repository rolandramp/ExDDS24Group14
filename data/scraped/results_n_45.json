    "title": "What can I do if I cannot repay the deficiency balance?",
    "question": "I voluntarily surrendered my car back in February. I never missed a payment before surrendering it. When I went to surrender the car they only asked for the key said it was fine that the worst that could happen would be a repo showing on my credit. I proceeded to ask for proof that I had voluntarily surrendered the car but they said since it was a Saturday they wouldn’t be able to process the repossession until Monday and that I would receive paper work during the week. Two weeks went by and I didn’t receive anything. They eventually contacted me by phone only to let me know that I was behind on a payment, they said my last payment was in March which wasn’t possible because I surrendered the car in February. They said that they had made a note but they continued to call either way. Then just two days ago (April 13, 2021) I received a letter in the mail saying that my car had been repossessed due to 2 failed payments and that I could pick it up if I payed the outstanding balance and the repossession fee. It also says if I do not answer they will proceed to sell it at a private auction and hold me accountable for the deficiency balance. I am not working so I have no way of paying it.",

        "Clearly, the lender does not have a coherent repossession process because of the conflicting notices and reports you are receiving. One thing is clear: when they are finished, you will owe them more money because the sales price of the car will not cover the amount you owe on the loan.

        "A voluntary surrender does not relieve you of the obligation to pay the balance due on the loan balance or lease balance as the case may be. Once the car is sold at auction, you will get a letter from the lender indicating how much you still owe. At that point, talk to a bankruptcy lawyer about your options."

    "question": "I'm trying to sell my home and I found out I have a lien from State Farm on the second mortgage that was included in a bankruptcy chapter 7 in 2010. I since received a loan modification on my first in 2014 from State Farm as well. But the second refuses to remove the lien even with the loan modification because their account number for their loan was not put on it is that legal?",

        "You may not be able to sell if all secured debts are not paid off unless the 2nd agrees to a short sale. Discharge affects your personal liability not the \"IN REM\" interest which is the security in the asset of real estate. Thus, you can negotiate but what do you get out of it? Nothing? If so, what if you instead just live there forever until someone forcloses or rent it out till someone forecloses? You can argue to the 2nd you may do that and they might receive zero . But we don't know the value of house and debt of the first mortgage and thus you may end up with zero. But the ability to live there free w/o any payments till a forclosure you could save that money and use later to buy a new place or to live on..or go to Vegas! Choices! I hope I helped!",
        "Although you may no longer owe the second mortgage, the lien means the property owes the money, which has to be paid on sale. Had you wanted to lien strip, you would have needed to do this in a chapter 13, assuming you met the eligibility requirements. Hope this perspective helps.",
        "Yes. Secured loan survives BK. The second loan remains secured.",
        "You have to disclose but you cannot \"include\" a secured debt in Chapter 7. The creditor always has the right to foreclose, especially in a liquidation. The 2nd mortgage does not just go away simply because you entered Chapter 7. Talk to a competent bankruptcy attorney to determine whether you have any remedies."

    "question": "Mom Passed Aug 2013, Assets left are worth only about $1200 (Clothing , some furniture, etc.) No Land, House, Insurance etc. just a Car worth about $3000 but she signed that over to me weeks before she passed. In the will she leaves all assets to me and my 2 sisters, I was appointed the executor of the will, my concern is she left credit card debt of about $9000 on 2 Credit card companies. Am I forced to go into probate/estate just so those Companies have something to sue. Or is me sending the Notarized Affidavid with Death certificate to them enough. Trying not to spend thousands on a lawyer to settle my Moms Debts. Thank You in advanced",

        "There is no need to file a probate under these circumstances. Just inform each creditor that your mother has passed away and that you won't be opening up a probate proceeding as the estate would be insolvent. In theory one of the creditors could attempt to open a probate with them acting as administrator, but given that such an endeavor is likely to cost them far more than they could hope to recover, this is very unlikely.",
        "I think you ment August 2012. Whether you open probate or not, the creditor's have one year to file their claim. If you dont open a probate they need to open the probate and file their claim. THe only liability you could have is to the extent you take assets. The biggest issue is the car. Your mother would have had to deliver and sign over the title to you before death, not just hand you the keys.\n\nMost likely you will not have to do anything. Have you been communicating with the credit card companies? What have you said and what have they said?",
        "If the estate is insolvent, there is no need to open probate. You don't even have to initially provide the credit card company with any information. Next time you get a bill, you can call them and tell them the cardholder is deceased.",
        "You can simply send certified letters to the creditors with the death certificate informing the creditor's there are no assets and there will be no probate. Probate is not required under the facts you have provided."

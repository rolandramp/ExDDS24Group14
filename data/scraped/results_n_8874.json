    "title": "Can I sue Chase for ruining my credit wherein they did not honor a judgment in my favor?",
    "question": "I used my Chase credit card to purchase an $800 sofa from a local furniture store. Within a few months, the couch broke. I contacted the merchant/furniture store to ask them to repair it. They declined. I asked for a new sofa. They declined. I placed the transaction in dispute. Chase investigated and issued determination in merchant's favor. I sued Chase and I prevailed. I received Judgment in my favor for $800 + court costs. Chase did not honor judgment. Chase reported me to Credit Bureaus and did a charge off. My credit score has dropped 60 or 70 points. My mortgage broker informed me that I could not qualify for a decentrate due to my current score. Chase has done nothiing in response to my numerous phone calls, letters, faxes and service of my favorable judgment.",

        "I would need to see your small claims complaint and the judgment in your favor to be able to advise you on this. The problem is that most small claims judgments are for money only. Unlike superior court cases, small claims judgments do not normally contain findings of fact or directions to either party, such as to delete an item from the credit report, unless the party agrees to do this in the courtroom. Since you won the judgment against Chase, in theory it may be that Chase should pay your judgment, so you can pay off the disputed balance account. Or, Chase should just close the account at zero (not a \"write off\"), stop reporting the account to the bureaus, at which point you would consider the judgment satisfied.\n\nFor Chase to be liable under the Fair Credit Reporting Act (\"FCRA\"), you first must dispute it with the Credit Reporting Agencies (CRAs). Direct calls to Chase do not make it liable under the FCRA. And I advocate that you send your dispute to each CRA, by Certified Mail, return receipt requested, and be sure to keep a copy for your records. In the first link, below, is my web site's free sample letters. Take a look at letter #3.1, which is for disputes to the CRAs, and it has all of their addresses in the letter for you.\n\nSince you have a judgment, you can enforce it, such as by placing a lien on all Chase's real property in various counties around the state or by getting orders to seize their assets or levy their \"bank\" account, which would probably be the simplest way to enforce your money judgment.",
        "Looks like you have a separate case against Chase.\n\nFirst, I would start collection activity against Chase since you have a judgment.\nSecond, I would send a letter to the credit bureaus disputing the amount. If it is not resolved in 30 days, then I would seek competent counsel to file an action against Chase for violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and California Rosenthal and Credit Reporting Agencies Act."

        "I agree with my colleagues in that you are not such a bad credit risk, given your inability to obtain another discharge for eight (8) years. However, I respectfully disagree that borrowing the money is necessarily a bad idea. It would depend upon how much it cost you to borrow the money and what you did with it. Assuming you are able to borrow against the value of your home in the first place, it would be all about the rate of interest and what you did with the money. Taking out the loan and making timely monthly payments would be a good start to rebuilding the hit your credit took by filing the bankruptcy. But you should be careful so as to not get yourself into another financial hardship situation as, again, you cannot discharge the debt if you do take out the loan.",
        "I don't know anyone that actually has equity in their house anymore! Although you legally can do it, whether a lender will do this is another issue altogether. Try some local credit unions. Hope this perspective helps!",
        "There is no rule against such an application. You just have to find a bank that will accept your application. BTW, you are not such a bad risk. After all, you can't file bankruptcy for 8 years. The loan will also depend on whether you still have a mortgage on the home and how big that mortgage is. If the home equity loan is secured by lots of equity in your home, you may not have any trouble at all getting a loan.\n\nBut I do have a serious concern for you. Why are you thinking about borrowing money at this time in your life? You have just escaped debt slavery by the skin of your teeth. Why are you jumping back into the credit pool with the sharks?\n\nIf you have a serious reason to do this, then buy some term life insurance (for your surviving spouse, in case you die unexpectedly) and jump in. If there is no life and death reason for this loan, then don't do it. Find another way. Good luck."

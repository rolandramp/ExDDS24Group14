    "title": "How can I reduce amount owed on a repossessed car?",
    "question": "I had a car repossessed a couple years ago. The company told me I would owe the difference between what I owed at the time, and what they sold it for. The difference was $2,000. I moved, left a forwarding address, but a person at my old address apparently signed for a letter from the company. I didn't hear from them for a couple years. They showed me this letter, with a signature, but it was not mine. They now say I owe $12,000. It is with a collection agency. How do I get it down to the original $2,000? Thanks.",

        "Please review my legal guide, in the link below, on vehicle repossession and consumer rights. You have several potential defenses and areas where they may be weak. If you articulate these when you call the finance company, they should agree to lower the amount so that they get paid and don't risk getting nothing if they lose. Please remember the four year statute of limitations on written contracts from date of last payment. Has that time expired, yet? Please be sure that you have written documentation of your settlement in full with the finance company.\n\nI prepared this legal guide for your question. If you find it helpful, please indicate that by checking the box at the end that it was helpful. Thanks!",
        "Offer $500.00 to settle and negotiate. Collection agency bought claim for pennies on dollar and will not fight extremely hard. You can also demand that they validate the debt and show how it became $12,000.

        "The two things you need to have to settle a debt for less than what is claimed is cash in hand & credibility.\n\nIf you have the cash, that may be enough.\n\nAn experienced bankruptcy or debt settlement attorney could provide the credibility. By credibility, I mean that a person needs to have the qualifications to drag out the collection process, since money now is worth a lot more than money later.\n\nHope this helps & good luck!",
        "You need to contact the collection agency and explain to them that the signature they have is not yours. Explain to them that you also did not consent for anyone to sign on your behalf. Collection agencies tend to settle for a fraction of what's owed since they buy the debt for a fraction of its value. Try offering them $1000 for them to go away. In the event they decline your offer and sue you, I do not believe they will be able to prove up $12,000 in interest and late fees. Good luck!!"

    "title": "Can I be listed as a defendant when I was never notified (or served) that there was going to be a hearing?",
    "question": "In 2002, I had a credit card that was charged off. Last month, a collection agency took it upon themselves to pull the file and took it to court without notifying me. Court was held on May 5th . I found out about this from my company payroll dept who forwarded me a copy of the Whit of Execution with a Money Judgment to withhold funds from my payroll.",

        "Under the facts you listed about finding out about this from a wage garnishment, you have the right to set aside the default judgment and defend the case. You need to act promptly to do this. If the lawsuit was filed after the statute of limitations has expired, you also have the right to file a counter suit for collection abuse by this debt collector for suing you on a time-barred debt. Perhaps you should review my web site, below. Also, please take a look at my Avvo profile, as I have several legal guides, including negotiating with the debt collection law firm and about wage garnishment.",

        "A \"write off\" is just an internal accounting technique that doesn't mean that your debt is gone and that no one will try to collect it, and in CA, the statute of limitations on written contracts is 4 years form the date of breach, which is often the date of your last payment, so if your last payment was made in 2006 or later, this debt may still be actionable.\n\nBut chances seem good that the statute may have run on this debt, and you may have a good defense to this claim.

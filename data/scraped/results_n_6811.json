        "You need to consult with an attorney in your area. Your question uses the word \"fraud\" and while it is true that debts obtained by fraud would not be dischargeable, it is not automatic. The creditor would have to raise the dischargeability issue in an adversary complaint. Even though you mention a \"charge\" of discharge, that is completely different than a judgement. Consult with an attorney to determine if it's even worth filing bankruptcy. It may be worth taking the risk if you have other debts besides this one to deal with in bankruptcy. If this is your only debt and your only reason to file bankruptcy is to run from this, you may face a bad faith dismissal, which is an entirely different issue.",
        "Bankruptcy will not be of any value to you.\n\nThere are exceptions to discharge (meaning the debt goes away), and this debt qualifies as a debt that won't go away.\n\nIf you want to read for yourself, it is 11 USC 523 (a).\n\nGood luck.",
        "If they proved fraud, then the debt is not subject to discharge. He can pay it off in full through Chapter 13.\n\nDid the court actually rule that his actions were fraud?",
        "Debts incurred by fraud are not dischargeable under any chapter."

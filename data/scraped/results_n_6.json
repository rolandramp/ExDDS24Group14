    "title": "Is there a duty to correct the court record after admitting facts filed with court were wrong?",
    "question": "I'm a creditor in a consumer bankruptcy adversary proceeding. After filing for a court judgment after debtor defaulted on stipulated judgment, the defendant filed an objection response with the court. The defendant claimed that a payment was made that was not made in order to perpetuate a false narrative that the court would be more sympathetic too. However, no evidence was ever provided for the payment. After several weeks, the defendant's attorney admitted to me before the hearing the correct amount was what I had conveyed to the court which contradicts what the defendant filed with the court. Is there a duty to correct the court record by the defendant and the attorney?",

        "The debtor's lawyer cannot knowingly submit information to the court which is false or inaccurate. If the lawyer who prepared a declaration to be signed by the debtor (his client) knew some of the facts were false and inaccurate, the lawyer has committed a serious violation of Federal Rules and a breach of his ethical obligations to the judge, the court, and the Rule of Law. He can be disciplined, even disbarred for this, plus fined and, in an egregious case, subjected to possible jail time. If he did not know of the falsity of the facts at the time and found out later, I believe he has a duty to correct the record with a supplemental declaration. From what you said, you can file a complaint with the State Bar as well as with the US Trustee if the lawyer knowingly submitted false information to the court. The key is when did he know the information was false? Before or after he submitted it?",
        "Generally, papers filed with the Court should be accurate. If information needs to be updated then supplemental papers maybe filed. Do you have a lawyer helping you? There maybe certain procedures you can do to correct those types of things or have the other party do so. I suggest you hire a lawyer who represents creditors asap."

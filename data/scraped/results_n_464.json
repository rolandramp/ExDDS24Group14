    "title": "In Ch. 7 bankruptcy, does a delinquent debt from the Franchise Tax Board of CA get discharged?",
    "question": "I recently received a letter from the Franchise Tax Board of CA stating that I will have my earnings withheld until a debt is paid off. This isn't from taxes, it is from a driving ticket that went unpaid about 10 years ago. I will be filing for Ch. 7 this week and will include this debt but will it be discharged? Will the wage garnishments stop? There is phone number on the letter that I can call if the court ordered payment will cause an undue hardship. What steps should I take here? Thanks in advance.",
    "answers": [
        "I agree with Mr. Firth. I suggest you call the number and set up a payment plan you can live with. the Bankruptcy will get rid of other debt and help you better afford this debt. Your bankrutpcy attorney could have answered this for you.",
        "A bankruptcy will stop the garnishment while you are in bankruptcy but it will not discharge the debt as it is criminal in nature. I suggest that you call the phone number to see if you qualify for an undue hardship, but you probably won't. You have had ten years to pay this thing.",
        "I agree with my colleagues. A bankruptcy filing will stop the garnishment for the time while you are in the bankruptcy but it will not wipe out this type of debt. You will need to eventually set up a payment plan with the creditor in order to avoid garnishment in the future."

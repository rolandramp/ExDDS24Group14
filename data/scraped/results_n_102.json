    "question": "I filed a chapter 7 a little over 7 years ago. I know you have to wait 8 years to file another. Going through hard times, and have a creditor suing me was served a week or so ago. I have no assets other than my wages and would be devastated if they were to garnish them. With not being able to file a chapter 7 for about 7 more months, should I look into filing a chapter 13? If so can I convert that 13 to a 7 once allowed to do so? Thank you.",

    "answers": [
        "Answer the complaint and try to negotiate; don't let a default be taken.\n\nIf it's a national credit card, you have federal protections if you are minority, female, disabled, or on some type of public assistance (CARES Act, Social Security, Worker's Comp, disability, public pension). These could be grounds for a federal countersuit, which banks do not like, but which might make settlement attractive.\n\nYou've spent 8 years digging out of BK; you should try to avoid going there again.\n\nGOOD LUCK!!",
        "I agree with the attorneys who recommend waiting to file the Chapter 7 and not a Chapter 13 case. You cannot convert a Chapter 13 to Chapter 7 and be eligible for Discharge if the 13 is filed within the 8 year time period. You would have to let the Chapter 13 case dismiss, then file a Chapter 7 after the expiration of 8 years. If creditor obtains you can file a Claim of Exemption and the court would more than likely grant it.",
        "I agree with several of the above, but not all. Some of the answers are for other states and are probably good in those states but don't apply here.\n\nI would recommend that you file a \"general denial\" answer to the lawsuit. Basically, all you are saying is that they should prove-up their case in court. It avoids them from getting a \"default judgment\" against you without having to go to the effort of proving to the court that you owe it.\n\nAfter that, you will receive some documents called \"Interrogatories,\" \"Request for Production of Documents,\" and the most important of all the \"Request for Admissions.\" The Request for Admissions lists all the things they have to prove to get a judgment against you. You will have 30 days to answer the documents. If you don't, they can ask the court to order you to answer the documents and ask the court to find that your failure to answer the Request for Admissions be treated as you agree that they are true.\n\nBy the time they accomplish this and finally get a judgment against you, a minimum of 4 months and as many as 8 months will have passed. By then, you should be close to your 8 years from the filing of your prior Chapter 7 case. Even after they get a judgment, it usually is months before they start levying accounts or garnishing your paycheck.\n\nEven if they got as far as a levy or garnishment, it can be stopped by a Chapter 7 Bankruptcy case being filed.\n\nI agree that you should see an attorney that does nothing but bankruptcy and, perhaps a small amount of consumer law. Most attorneys give a free initial consultation and can advise you what the best route is for you to go to protect yourself.\n\nLet me suggest how to find a good bankruptcy attorney.\n\n1. Go to the CA state bar website. There is a link to find a specialist. You put in the county (Sacramento). It will show you who are BAR CERTIFIED bankruptcy law specialists. less than 1 in 1000 attorneys have that certificate.\n\n2. Go to the National Association of Consumer Bankruptcy Attorneys (NAC.BA.org) website. These attorneys have committed to not representing creditors. They are there to represent you when you have financial problems. They have on-going training. They have national seminars that attorneys go to or webinars online. They have annual workshops and conventions. I taught at one of the conventions in 2017. Click the “find an attorney” button and do a search.\n\n3. Of course, there is AVVO.com. You can look up bankruptcy attorneys in your area on AVVO. AVVO has its' own rating system. I’m NOT talking about reviews, because reviews can go kind of wonky. Once in a while the attorney will get somebody that doesn’t like them or there is a falling out between the attorney and the client. The attorney ends up with a bad review and five stars go out the window through no fault of the attorney.\n\nInstead, look at AVVO’s own RATING. There are several attorneys in Sacramento that have a 10.0 AVVO rating. Their rating is a much better indicator of the quality of the attorney.\n\nThen go to the AVVO PROFILE for that attorney. Now what you want to look for is a pie chart. It divides up and shows how much an attorney does in different fields of law. You want somebody that bankruptcy is all or almost all they do.\n\nAnother thing you should look for on the attorney’s AVVO profile is ATTORNEY ENDORSEMENTS. That is an excellent way to see what the other attorneys in the bankruptcy and other fields think of them. An attorney is not going to endorse another attorney if they don’t think the attorney is at the top of their field.\n\nHire based on the quality of the attorney, not price. You don't hire a second-rate attorney any more than you would hire the veterinarian's assistant to do brain surgery on you. Bankruptcy is not about filling out papers. It is about how and when to use that tool called bankruptcy to achieve a goal, that being the best start possible for you moving forward.\n\nI hope this helps you find a highly competent bankruptcy attorney.",
        "I agree with some/most that has been said before me. Time is of the essence where a lawsuit has been filed against you and served upon you. If/when a creditor obtains a judgment, or default judgment, they will, attempt to collect by way of: Wage Garnishment; Bank Levy; Judgment Lien against Real Estate, etc. It is too common that consumers/debtors take no action after being sued by creditors. For Ch. 7, a new case will need to be filed AFTER the 8 years since the prior Ch. 7 filing date. Because your Ch. 7 filing was more than 4 years ago, you will be entitled to a Discharge Order if you complete a Ch. 13 Bankruptcy filing; which might or might not makes sense depending on several factors. I recommend that you contact an attorney (or a couple of attorneys) in your area who you might want to work with. GOOD LUCK!",
        "I believe I slightly both agree and disagree with the prior answers. Why?\n1. I 100% agree NEVER to think you can file ch 13 and convert to ch 7 as the date of the ch 13 filing is used for the 8 yr rule so you would NOT get a discharge.\n\n2. I did NOT see any attorney recommend that INSTEAD of filing an answer, why not enter a notice of appearance (NOA) ONLY at this time before the deadline for answering. In my state, that acts to stop a judgment from being entered on day after the deadline (here 21 days). Thus, you give them a NOA and then what? You wait..and wait and wait forever. In my clients, I have them do a PRO SE notice of appearance and if they retained me they add paragraph to advice the Plaintiff's attorney that they employed my office to file a bankruptcy about to be filed. Then you wait until FINALLY a motion for default is filed and that Court hearing is down the road. Then one day before that deadline to file an answer, you file ANSWER denying where appropriate etc. with attorney's help on wording. Then what? YOU WAIT again, until a motion for summary judgment is entered and hope that date is beyond the 8 yr rule so you can file ch 7. Even if not, the ability to enforce the judgment may be a time period after that before a garnishment. And even if garnishment starts, you file when 8 yr rule is up.\n\nI hope I helped in addition to the great answers provided. Bring this answer to an experienced bankruptcy attorney near you to hire them and delay that lawsuit. Good luck.",
        "Agreeing with the responses above, you can file an answer or a \"general denial\" which will prevent a default and give you time to file the chapter 7 case.\n\nYou may qualify for a fee waiver on court fees so there could be no charge for filing the answer.\n\nSee instructions made available by Sacramento Public Law Library here:\n\nhttps://saclaw.org/wp-content/uploads/lrg-responding-to-a-lawsuit.pdf?vt_session_id=&page=1\n\nFiling an answer or general denial in state court may be easier to pull off than filing a chapter 13 case because that can be a lot of work to prevent it from being dismissed before you are eligible to file a new chapter 7 case which could result in a discharge.",
        "If there is any way you can wait to file Chapter 7, that is the usually the better option. If you file a timely Answer to the lawsuit it will greatly lengthen the time it takes the creditor to get to a garnishment. You should get a couple of consultations right away. You will want to know how long it will takes a creditor to garnish your wages as well as your bankruptcy options.",
        "Yes you can file a 13 and that would stop the lawsuit from proceeding. You would then dismiss your 13 when you become eligible for a 7. The conversion relates back to the filing of the 13, not the conversion date.",
        "The eight year waiting period runs from date of filing to date of filing so you may be closer to the expiration of the waiting period than you think. If you file an answer to the law suit denying that you owe the money, it will take more than seven months to get to a judgment and garnishment, See a bankruptcy attorney for details."

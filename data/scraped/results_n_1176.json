        "I agree with two of the other attorneys, but I do want you to remember that you gave the payday lenders your bank information, and they can still attempt to cash their checks in person or electronically. I recommend to my clients that they get a new bank account for their money, and try to get the SSI deposited into that different bank account. Don't just try to open a new account at the same bank! In the meantime, send each lender a letter rescinding the permission you gave them to access your accounts. Keep a copy of each letter. If you can afford to, send each by certified mail, return receipt requested, and put the certified number from the receipt on the letter itself, along with the date and your signature, addressed to the lender on the letter, and make a copy of each letter of rescission. They would be violating the law to try to cash that check electronically. You will face a charge from your bank to put a stop payment on each check, so that is another debt that you would not have to pay if you change banks. Your SSI is safe in the new bank, because your creditors cannot \"levy\" a direct-deposit SSI account effectively. You can claim an exemption if you have to, but that is unlikely. However, your current bank can \"offset\" the overdraft or bounced check charges. You do not have to worry about your check being turned over to the authorities for criminal prosecution. These types of payday loans are called \"deferred deposit\" loans, and they are not permitted to turn them over for collection by the authorities. If you want to get more peace, seek a free consultation from a local, experienced Bankruptcy Attorney as suggested by some others who answered your question. Use Avvo's \"Find a Lawyer\" tab, above. I would never assume nor believe you can be certain that you are \"judgment-proof\" (I like the term \"bullet-proof\"!). Let an attorney ask you enough questions to make that determination for you. God bless your future!",
        "To answer your question, no, your section 8 housing should not be affected by your filing for bankruptcy.\nBut to go further, you may be what we lawyers call \"judgment proof\" because creditors, such as the payday loan agencies, cannot touch Social Security benefits, even if they win a judgment against you in court. So if SSDI is your only source of income, your creditors can still call you, write threatening letters, and even sue you, but in the end they cannot take any of your money as it is protected by federal law. You should still consult with a bankruptcy attorney to make sure you fall into the category I describe, but your income may already be protected from creditors even without a bankruptcy.",
        "No, filing for bankruptcy will not affect Section 8 eligibility.",
        "Unless you owe money to the section 8 housing program and your landlord, filing bankruptcy is unlikely to affect your ability to stay in your home. However, the types of debt you describe do not typically make me think that you are a good candidate for bankruptcy, which is a program designed to help the middle class wage earner, not the indigent. More information is at the link below. Hope this perspective helps!"

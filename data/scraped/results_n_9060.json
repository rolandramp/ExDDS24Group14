    "title": "Can a creditor send you to collections if you've been making good-faith payments each month to resolve the debt?",
    "question": "We received a medical bill and could not pay it in full. We've been making monthly payments directly to the creditor to pay the bill in full. The creditor has accepted each payment and sent invoices showing the new balance due. Then, out of nowhere, we received notice from a collection agency saying their client (the creditor) gave us all the time \"they felt was justified\" in paying the debt. If we're making a good-faith effort to pay the entire balance in full, and the creditor acknowleges and accepts that effort by cashing our checks, can they still send us to collections?",
    "answers": [
        "Medical offices are loathe to accept payments unless expressly agreed. Next time, before the you go to this office or if you realize you cannot pay it after wards, contact the office and find out what payments would be accepted. If you cannot agree with them on a set amount and monthly payment date and method (check, credit card, etc) then your payments are likely to get this same result of collection referral. Unless your payment arrangement was agreed by the provider, payment in full is expected at the time of rendering medical services or shortly after being billed. Confirm any payment arrangements in writing, such as by fax, email, or regular letter.\n\nBelow is a link to my legal guide on negotiating debts, even if you've been sued on it.",
        "Yes. Any time your account is delinquent the lender may refer to collections. \"Good faith\" payments that are less then the amount due lowers your balance, but does not affect the delinquency of the note.\n\nGood luck to you.\n\nDisclaimer: attorney's response is not intended as legal advice and is intended for informational purposes only. Inquirer should seek the advice of a duly licensed attorney within that jurisdiction."

    "title": "Will a mortgage holder try reinstate your mortgage that has been discharged in bankruptcy if you make one payment on a new loan?",
    "question": "We are getting many mixed messages from Wells Fargo about refinancing and making payments on a discharged mortgage. I know someone who worked at a bank and was told they may try to reinstate the old loan rather then give you a new one. Is this true?",

    "answers": [
        "Respectfully, your question does not make any sense. If you have a \"new\" loan, payments made on it will not affect your old loan. If the old loan was discharged, you personal liability on it is extinguished. However, if you refinance the old loan and obtain a \"new\" loan --- your bankruptcy discharge does affect the new loan obtained post filing and discharge.",
        "Payments on a loan that was not reaffirmed, are just payments that must be credited to the loan, but these payments cannot reinstate personal liability because that would be a violation of the discharge order.\nA strategy of making another loan could create personal liability, but should not be considered without your understanding of liability issues, you should review this with your attorney.\nGood luck",
        "Making payments post-discharge cannot change that as long as you did not reaffirm the mortgage during the bankruptcy, you are no longer personally liable for the loan."

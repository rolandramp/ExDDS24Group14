        "Is this actually a California case? There is no such thing as a \"class b\" misdemeanor in California, but some other states have that kind of classification system.\n\nYes, you are in danger of deportation while in the diversion program. In most domestic violence (DV) diversion programs, you enter a guilty plea, but sentencing is continued for a year. During that time, you have to complete a DV class and counseling, and generally stay out of trouble. At the end of the year, the case is dismissed.\n\nFor immigration purposes, you are considered convicted after the guilty plea until the case is dismissed. After the dismissal, it is not considered a conviction and should not cause further difficulties.\n\nThe courts do not usually report diversion entries to immigration authorities. If you were incarcerated in the county jail, you might be subject to an immigration hold, which could start immigration court proceedings; fortunately, diversion programs rarely require you to serve jail time.\n\nFor more information, check out the Immigrant Law Resource Center at http://www.ilrc.org\n\nPlease understand that this is a general discussion of legal principles by a California lawyer and does not create an attorney/client relationship. It's impossible to give detailed, accurate advice based on a few sentences on a website (and you shouldn't provide too much specific information about your legal matter on a public forum like this site, anyway). You should always seek advice from an attorney licensed in your jurisdiction who can give you an informed opinion after reviewing all of the relevant information.",

Sometimes the best option from a criminal standpoint is not the best for immigration, so you need a lawyer who knows both areas and has lots of experience. A domestic violence charge can have very serious consequences for immigration, so you must be very careful."

    "title": "401K loans? How to handle them in Chapter 7 filing",
    "question": "My husband has $700 month deducted from his bring home pay because of a 401K loan (about 1/3 of his bring-home pay). In bankrupty the trustee doesn't consider this a true debt (since he is paying himself back). His 401K rules won't allow him to default on these loans. How will this situation be handled in Chapter 7 filing?",
    "answers": [
        "You can still make the deduction provided you have sufficient expenses to offset your income even after backing the 401k loan out of your budget. While bankruptcy will not allow you to use the deduction as a expense to offset your income on the budget you provide to the court, the deduction will not be effected if you can show that your expenses exceed your income even without the 401k deduction.\n\nLEGAL DISCLAIMER\nMr. Larkin is licensed to practice law in CA and is located in San Diego. His response here does not constitute legal advice and does not create an attorney/ client relationship. The response is in the form of legal education and is intended to provide general information about the matter in question. Many times the questioner may leave out details which would make the reply unsuitable. Mr. Larkin strongly advises the questioner to confer with an attorney in their own state to acquire more information about the specifics of their case.",
        "It depends on your jurisdiction. In the District of Idaho and Eastern District of Washington the 401k loan is considered a secured debt and the continued deduction for the loan payment from your husband's paycheck is considered an allowable deduction. Anyone reading this question and responses should consult with an attorney in their jurisdiction for the proper legal advice."

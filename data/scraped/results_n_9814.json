    "title": "Can debt collector get your license suspended if you do pay?",
    "question": "My daughter living in CA was in an accident which was her fault. She was driving without Insurance at the time, this occurred a year and half ago. Due to the accident she had to purchase SR 22 Insurance to get her license back. My daughter was seriously injured, broke neck, liver damage, head trauma. The other party had no physical injuries. The other party's Insurance company paid to have their auto fixed. My daughter received a letter from a debt collector (this is the first contact since the accident) They say if my daughter does not reimburse the other party's Insurance company for money paid to repair the other party's car they will have my daughter's license suspended again. There has been no judgement, nor court hearing involving the other party. my daughter just got her license back and does not want it suspended again, can a debt collector suspend her license while she is paying for a SR22 Insurance, if she does not pay them approx. $7000. the insurance co. paid to fix their insured person's car?My daughter has been unemployed since just before the accident and does not have money to pay this $7000. and I am on disability and can not afford to pay it either. There was no alcohol involved in the accident. Apparently the other party had uninsured motorist insurance, which paid for the damages. Does my daughter have to pay this money in order to keep her license from being suspended again?",

    "title": "I wrote several bad checks to a local indian casino. What happens if I file BK... Can the checks be included as debt?",
    "question": "The local casino increased my check cashing limit and the compulsive gambler that I am went completely out of control. Now I am faced with not being able to cover the checks I've written. I'm now faced with the real possibility of having to file bankruptcy again. I also filed back in 2005 so I that may also not be an option. From what I have researched so far, it looks like the bad checks could not be included in the BK even if that were possible. What are my options at this point?",

        "You can, and should, include them in your schedules. The casino may try to file an adversary proceeding to declare that these debts are not discharegable, but you have a right to a trial. One issue is whether, at the time you wrote the checks, the casino knew or should have known, that you did not have sufficient funds in your account.",
        "Possibly a chapter 13. The checks would be dischargeble in the bk. Is the casino coming after you? A strategic move may be to sit back and file a chap 7 in 2013.",
        "If you filed a chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2005 you will not be able to file another chapter 7 for 8 years. That would be anytime next year after the date you filed in 2005. Your gambling debts are dischargeable unless the Casino files a fraud action against you and win. if you must file for bankruptcy now then a Chapter 13 is your best bet. Please consult with an attorney to have your case reviewed.",
        "It looks like 8 years haven't past since you last filed bankruptcy, but you can file a Chapter 13 and have between 3 - 5 years of relief by paying what the court feels you can afford to your creditors. As part of your repayment, I would expect that this bad check would be paid off.\n\nBTW, good thing you didn't try this stunt in Vegas, because you would be in jail over this kind of thing and you could not eliminate this debt through bankruptcy.\n\nHope this perspective helps!"

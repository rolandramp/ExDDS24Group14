        "You should not accept the check if the amount is not satisfactory to resolve the debt. While the debtor might not be entitled to do what he did you do not want to take the chance because the law is not that clear. What is clears that the debt is disputed and the person paying is conditioning the payment on your agreement to compromise. Judges like compromises to get rid of cases so it it might be an uphill battle if you cash the check and sue for the balance. You might also be sued back for various reasons.",
        "You would be testing the legal waters to accept this check with the letter. There are cases and even a statute (Cal. Civil Code Secs. 1521 to 1526) that indicate accepting such a check may constitute settlement in full. There are a number of facts missing from your posting, so no attorney can answer your question without more facts, such as whether the check also has the words \"Payment in Full\" and whether the balance is disputed.\n\nIf the balance is substantial, you should promptly contact a debt collection attorney before you hold this check or deposit it and take a chance on the rest of the balance. You should use Avvo's \"find a lawyer\" tab to help locate such a lawyer in your area."

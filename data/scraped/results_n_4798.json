    "title": "Better to divorce in CA or UT?",
    "question": "My wife wants a divorce. It is inevitable within the next year or two. She also wants to move to UT. We married in UT about 24 years ago, but have been living in CA for the past 20 years or so. We have a high-school teenager. If we were to move to UT, in which state would it be better for me to divorce? In other words, better to divorce prior to or after the move, when considering custody, spousal support, and child support? We would be happy with a 50/50 custody arrangement. I am the sole breadwinner. She is and has been a stay-at-home mom.",

        "I suggest that you consult with a good Family Law Attorney in California, and also consult with a good Family Law Attorney in Utah. Without knowing what rules a Utah Court will apply to support and property distribution issues I cannot comment on which forum is better. This is one of those situations where you really should do some more homework before taking the test.\n\nNevertheless, If you intend to continue living in California then you may prefer to file it all here, since having any future Court Hearings in your case in California would be preferable to driving (or flying) out to Utah every time you had to go to Court. If you keep at least 50/50 timeshare with your child you would likely keep the case in California if she tried to change the venue.",
        "Forum shopping for the best place to file a divorce isn't something an attorney should be helping you with on this cite. Normally you need to live in a state for six months and in a particular county for ninety days to have jurisdiction in that state and county.\n\nSincerely,\n\nErick Platten\n\n\nAttorneys on AVVO donate their time and your feedback is appreciated.

        "I can't tell you which state to do this in. California is a community property state. This means that all property and assets and debts acquired during the marriage will be deemed community \"property\" and this must be split equally. In CA, you wife will be entitled to spousal support for an indeterminate time period until she can be come self supporting herself. If your teen is a minor, then one party will be required to probably pay child support regardless of the suggested custody arrangement. If you file in Utah, you need to check their residency laws as residency prior to filing is usually determinative. If you file here in CA, you could still then move back to Utah, though."

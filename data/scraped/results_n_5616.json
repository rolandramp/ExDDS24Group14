    "title": "State Vehicle Registration Collections is wrongfully garnishing my account???",
    "question": "I was delinquent with my car registration in 2008 and I repaid it in it's entirety in 2010. I have since been paying my annual registration normally as they have been sending me my tags. My registration for 2013 is due in April and they even sent me my usual registration notice. Now all of a sudden they garnished my bank account for supposed vehicle collections without any form of notification AND even though my registration is current. I have called the phone number and cannot talk to anyone! How can I get them to stop garnishing my account AND can I get my money back?",

        "(I am assuming all of these problems are for one vehicle only.)\n\nHere are my suggestions:\n1. Usually with bank levies, you have only TEN DAYS to contest the levy of your bank account with the Court. Make sure you do NOT miss the deadline to file an objection with the Court. The form you need to fill out should have come with the notice of levy. Since this is a State levy, I am not 100% sure you can object to the Court, but do so if you can!\n\n2. IMMEDIATELY, take all your paperwork (registrations from all years, proof of payment of registration all years) and go to your local DMV and try to sort it out in person there. Even if you do not have all the documentation, at least go to the DMV, try to speak to someone, and they should be able to look up your payment history on the computer. TAKE NOTES of date, time, who you spoke with, and what they said. If they say it is resolved, try to get something in writing (a computer printout) or something.\n\nIf they say it is resolved, attach these documents to the Court document and file it with the Court to request a hearing.\n\n(PS: Go back to the DMV in 3 weeks and speak to someone else to CHECK to make sure your record is cleaned up.)\n\n3. If the local DMV can't resolve it, at least ask them to give you a NAME and direct dial phone number of someone who can. Also request a payment history printout so you can see what the DMV shows as your payment history.\n\na. If the DMV payment history printout is the same as your records show, then file the documents with the Court to object to the levy as an error.\n\nb. Contact the person at the DMV whose name you received from the local DMV and send a letter to that person include a copy of all the documents showing you paid everything.\n\nc. Also, write a letter to the DMV office that levied you (address should be on the levy) and include a copy of all the documents showing you paid everything.\n\nGood luck.",

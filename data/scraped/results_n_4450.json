        "Not necessarily. The HOA dues, special assessments and fines run personally to the homeowner. So the HOA will most often pursue the former homeowner. If your HOA house is foreclosed on, you still have to pay the dues until the bank sells it to a third party and the title is not in your name anymore. The fines and fees of an HOA are a matter of private contract between the HOA and the homeowner--the CC&Rs are the contract. So they are not going to pursue anyone else for it, nor are they obligated to take it out of the house escrow/foreclosure transaction. They are pursuing you based on a breach of contract--not the foreclosure of your house, they are not the lender.",
        "The HOA has the option to pursue their remedies against the property or against you personally. It is their choice, not yours. Clearly the value of the property was considered insufficient to support their claim which is why they are now looking to obtain payment from you. Hope this perspective helps!"

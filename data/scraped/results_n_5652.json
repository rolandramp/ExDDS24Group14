    "question": "I'm in a lawsuit and ask to settle a case for $110,000 in slander charges. If i file for bankruptcy can I remove that slander charge ?",
    "answers": [
        "The law in the Ninth Circuit, which includes California, is that a claim for slander may be held nondischargeable pursuant to 11 U.S.C. ยง 523(a)(6). The court must make findings of fact supporting the elements that the injury is both \"willful\" and \"malicious\". I would caution you to be careful in how you settle the existing lawsuit. If you stipulate to a judgment which also sets forth the elements of slander and its factual support, you may not have much of a defense in bankruptcy court to a nondischargeability action. If you simply agree to pay an amount without admitting such facts, you will preserve your rights to contest the adversary complaint which the creditor must file and prove up anew in bankruptcy court.",
        "Probably yes. depending on the terms of the settlement. The slander claim can be discarged but keep in mind that bankruptcy is an all or nothing proposition you have to list everything you own and everyone you owe money to. You cannot pick and choose so you may have non-exempt assets you could risk loseing if you file just to get rid of this one thing, also you may negitively effect your credit.",
        "I disagree with my colleagues. Slander is an intentional tort and often includes malice as one of its elements. Under section 523(a)(6), debts incurred for willful and malicious injury to person or property are not dischargeable. If the plaintiff omits to bring a non-dischargeability action within about three months after the bankruptcy, however, the debt WILL be discharged. With this amount of money at stake, you should absolutely consult an experienced bankruptcy attorney in your area. Pick one who has defended 523(a)(6) non-dischargeability actions before.",
        "You need to talk to a good bk lawyer. There are some types of debts/claims that cant be discharged. Often cases based upon intentional conduct are not discharged. It is possible slander may fall w/in that category.",
        "Yes, most likely. If you file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy and list the lawsuit in which you are being sued for slander, you can obtain a discharge of that debt obligation. On several of those bankruptcy forms, you must indicate whether the claim is contingent, unliquidated, or disputed."

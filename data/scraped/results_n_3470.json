    "title": "Can I sue a dead person or his estate for personal injury claim?",
    "question": "Hi, I was in car injury. It was not my fault. The guy was at fault 100%. I've been in therapy. He was 81 and I recently learned he died over a year ago. The two year the statue of limitation for the accident is only a month away. The insurance company is not compensating me properly for my pain and suffering. Can I file a lawsuit? I just read online that the time to sue deceased person is 1 year in CA. What are my options? Thank you very much in advance for your answers!",

        "Some applicable law to the statute/rules/procedures/etc. for suing after the death of the \"defendant\" are as follows:\n\n“If a person against whom an action may be brought on a liability of the person, whether arising in contract, tort, or otherwise, and whether accrued or not accrued, dies before the expiration of the applicable limitations period, and the cause of action survives, an action may be commenced within one year after the date of death, and the limitations period that would have been applicable does not apply.” California Code of Civil Procedure § 366.2(a). The predecessor of California Code of Civil Procedure § 366.2 (formerly § 353) was amended to clarify just how strictly this one-year statute of limitations shall be applied. California Code of Civil Procedure § 366.2 now provides, that the one (1) year statute of limitations governs whether the decedent’s liability arises in contract, tort or otherwise, that other statutes of limitations do not control, and that tolling provisions other than specific Probate Code provisions do not apply. The probate code also provides for claims made for the debts of a decedent and expressly incorporates the one year statute of limitations described above. California Probate Code § 13109 (“Section 366.2 of the Code of Civil Procedure applies in an action under this section.”)\n\nI could write about ten pages or more... but if I did would have to include a table of contents and table of authorities... the law seems clear, but it has some very limited exceptions... the type of exceptions that need a lawyer to investigate for each and every case.\n\nFortunately, most of us personal injury types offer free consultations and take such cases on contingency no matter where the case is in California, so there is nothing to fear in calling us.\n\n- Paul\n\nPaul J.

        "I have dealt with this issue before.

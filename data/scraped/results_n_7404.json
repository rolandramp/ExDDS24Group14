    "title": "Should I pay $196.19 to Aspire as a settlement offer (90% off) or what?",
    "question": "I have been debating myself whether to pay $196.19 from collection agency. They said if I pay $196.19 in full to settle my debt. That is 90% discount off my actual balance. I am not sure about that because I DO have another credit card that I owe might not make me feel fair to pay just one $196.19 in full while I still owe others. It did not matter if I pay in full of $196.19 because it will not get me to a better score or better credit rating the reason of my owing to other credit card and one lien against me for $2,600. I don't have $2,600 nor $1,300 as a settlement offer because I don't have $1,300. To pay $196.19 in full is a deadline this coming Sunday to only one collection agency for Aspire credit card. I still not sure about it because if I pay it in full",

        "My guess is that your credit isn't very good right now, regardless. If you owe $18,000 in credit card debt and have reached the point of a collections company coming after you, your credit rating is likely poor.\n\nSettling an account will not harm your credit as greatly as simply not paying. However, the ultimate impact on your credit likely isn't much at this point.\n\nThe thing is, I highly doubt you will get a better offer than to pay just 10% of what you owe. Maybe you do, but even then, the difference will be marginal- there isn't a whole lot of room to go down.\n\nGiven your comment on both Mr. Halpern and Mr. Roberts' responses, my guess is that you are actually concerned about whether you should continue with an attempted piecemeal settlement of all of your debt or if you should just file for bankruptcy. The benefit to bankruptcy is that it will eliminate all of your credit card debt (with very few exceptions- a bankruptcy attorney in your area would be happy to sit down and answer your questions). Most people typically don't have trouble obtaining credit again after filing bankruptcy since they are not able to file again for several years.\n\nThe drawback to bankruptcy is that it will have a greater effect on your credit and will impact your credit for longer. However, a bankruptcy likely doesn't impact your credit score very much if you are in default on multiple credit card accounts. So the difference there may be minimal.\n\nUltimately, this is a decision you have to make for yourself. Do you want to go \"all in\" with a bankruptcy, accepting the slightly larger harm to your credit, or do you want to take the risk that some companies won't be as generous in their settlement offers and attempt to settle each debt, one by one? Personally, I think bankruptcy is probably the better option (without knowing more about your specific situation), but reasonable people may disagree.\n\nGood luck.",
        "My colleagues are correct. A 90% discount is good. The real question is what are you going to do with your other debts. Maybe this should be posted in the bankruptcy forum.",
        "I agree with Attorney Halpern. Why wouldn't you want a 90% discount on a credit card debt? Just make sure to clearly state on the check that it is payment in full.",
        "sounds like a 90% discount, not bad. If you do decide to accept the deal make sure you write on the check full and final payment as accord and satsifactoin."

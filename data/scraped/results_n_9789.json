    "title": "What responsibilities does my stepmother have after my father died. ie: bills, funeral, house, etc.?",
    "question": "My sister and I are on the deed, but he left her a third of the house value plus an annuity naming her the beneficiary. Should she have to pay his bills and funeral expenses? Plus he had a reverse mortgage and used approximately 54,000 dollars of it. Is she responsible for repayment?",

        "She could be personally responsible for the RM depending on the wording of the contract and the signatures / guarantees. Need to check the contract to be sure. Your father's estate should pay all of the expenses and bills but if the estate does not have enough cash then it may need to sell estate assets (stuff he owned in his name) before passing those assets to beneficiaries. Annuities should bypass the probate process but the house and his other assets will go through a probate. Create an account for the estate, pay all the bills and expenses, then distribute according to his will or intestate rules for CA. Depending on the size of his estate you may have to file an estate tax return with CA and the IRS. All of that is the responsibility fo the estate administrator so if your step-mother is in tha trole then all of this is her responsibility as well on behalf of the estate.",
        "If you and your sister are \"on the deed\" with your father as joint tenants, as a general rule, the house should pass to you outside of any probate. When the home was acquired and assets used to acquire it (i.e., during the marriage with your stepmother) may give her some claim to it however. The annuity should pass to her directly as the beneficiary, also outside of probate. The answer to the reverse mortgage question depends upon how the contract with the company reads but, in any event, they won't be looking for payment until the home is sold or vacated. As to the other debts, they are payable out of his estate, and the responsibility for payment depends upon how his estate is passing; there are options available in California to push those through probate, even though you might not otherwise have to probate the estate."

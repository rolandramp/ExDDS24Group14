        "I'm sorry to hear you have been through such a difficult time with this relationship. Unfortunately, we see questions like this here way too often (see link to one from the other day).\n\nI'm afraid the answer is the same here as it was to the last questioner - there is no way to actually revoke a green card. You can write a letter to USCIS, but saying what? Unless you have actual evidence that the marriage wasn't \"real\" - that the other person committed fraud in getting married only to get a green card - there may not be much point. My earlier answer gives some guidance on what this proof might be.\n\nGood luck for a happier future.",

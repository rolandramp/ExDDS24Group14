    "title": "IRA beneficiary is non-US citizen, what are the consequences?",
    "question": "I want to have my partner (registered in California) be a beneficiary to my IRAs upon my death. I have both ROTH and Traditional accounts. First, is this even possible? Second, what would be the specific tax consequences he would face upon my death? I can just imagine that it would be a nightmare for he and also for the Executor named in my will. My partner is a non-US citizen and lives in another country. He has no legal status with the US government. This could all change in the future if immigration laws are changed. But, for now, this is his current status.",

        "This is a very interesting question. Since the domestic partnership is under CA laws, I doubt the status of your partner will count. Yet on a federal level, there will be no possibility for her under existing immigration laws to get permanent status based on your relationship. You should into getting your partner some kind of employment based visa like H, O, P, etc.\n\nThis question is a dillema. I will be glad to hear the exact answer.\n\nGood Luck\nShah Peerally\n\nFounder and Managing Attorney of Shah Peerally Law Group PC\nLaw Firm Deals in Immigration law, Bankruptcy & Debt Relief\nhttp://peerallylaw.com\n37600 Central Ct, Ste 201,\nNewark CA 94560\nPhone: 510.742.5887\ninfo@peerallylaw.com\n\nNote: The above answer is provided for informational use only.

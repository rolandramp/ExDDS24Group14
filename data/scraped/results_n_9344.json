    "title": "Can my husband be the only financial sponsor for my mother's green card or do I have to be the sponsor too?",
    "question": "I became US citizen 3 months ago because my husband is American and he sponsored me. My mother came here on Visitor visa and I am going to file for her Green Card when I have ALL the papers ready. I am going to file all of them together (Adjustment of status too). I have just a couple papers left: Affidavit of Support. Do I have to be the main sponsor and my husband joint sponsor or can my husband be the ONLY financial sponsor? I don't work, he does. We have joint checking account with 11000 average balance and all other income assets is on his name.",

        "As the petitioner, USCIS will generally want to see your signature on an Affidavit of Support. This doesn't prevent your husband from being a part of it as well if his income is needed - either through his signing the Contract With Household Member supplement and including his financial info on the form or by signing a separate Affidavit of Support.\n\nEither way, he will be taking on significant financial obligations by becoming a joint sponsor.

        "Typically, the form B9 you received from the bankruptcy court will tell you when you are eligible to receive your discharge. Look under the section marked \"Deadlines.\"\n\nIn my community, my clients typically receive their discharge a few days after the final deadline noted has expired.\n\nHope this perspective helps.",
        "There's nowhere near enough information to answer your question. First of all, Rule 2004 is a procedure to take an examination (deposition). The means test is a form that gets filled out. I'm not sure what a \"rule 2004 mean test\" is. In a chapter 7 case where no assets are being disbursed by the Trustee, the discharge is usually granted after 60 have passed since the first date set for your meeting with the Trustee in your case, unless that time period is extended by the court. This also assumes the Trustee has concluded his meeting and filed a \"no asset\" report.\n\nIn order to answer your question I need to know if any of the above has happened, and if so, what the relevant dates are.\n\nMark J.

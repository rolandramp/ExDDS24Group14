    "title": "If we lose our home through foreclosure can the mortgage company move to garnish our wages for any shortfall",
    "question": "We moved to California in February and have a home in Illinois that has been on the market since January. We can no longer afford to continue paying the mortgage and our rent. We have submitted short sale papers to Citimortgage requesting a short sale with promissary note as my husband has a large salary and can pay off our obligation in monthly payments. We have NO disposable income. If we stop paying, can the mortgage company come after my husbands wages? The loan is in his name so if I open a savings account in my name can they come after that?",
    "answers": [
        "If you stop paying, your husband is liable for the note and costs to collect/foreclose. Illinois is a judicial foreclosure state which means that the lender must follow a drawn out legal process, obtain a judgment in Illinois, apply for a 'sister-state' judgment, writ of execution and come after your assets. California is a community property state so we share. Part of what you make is his and what he makes is yours but the judgment is against him.\nThe entire process in Illinois takes, on average, from the filing of the complaint to the eviction by the sheriff, nine months. Foreclosure defense in court is seldom successful in defeating the foreclosure action but may prolong the foreclosure by as much as 24 months. If the property is not residential or is abandoned, the process can be substantially shortened. The following is an outline of a typical foreclosure case:\n\nDefault\nFiling of Foreclosure\nPersonal Service of Summons\nForeclosure Judgment and Order of Sale\nReinstatement Period Expires (90 days after personal service)\nRedemption Period Expires (7 months after personal service or 3 months after judgment, whichever is later)\nForeclosure Sale\nForeclosure Sale Confirmed\nRight to Possession Expires (30 days after foreclosure sale confirmed)\nEviction by Sheriff of Named Parties\nRecording of Foreclosure Deed\n(this process can be shortened if the property is abandoned)\n\nNow the sister state judgment in Calif, to come after your husband for the deficiency, garnishment or collection against other personal assets or lien on real property.\n\nThe foreclosure process is the same whether you still live in Illinois or you move to Calif. except the house being empty and shortening the process.\n\nYou state you have NO 'disposable' income yet he has LARGE salary...(you'll need it here in CA). A writ of execution for the bank account can only have the defendant's name on it. But be careful. They can definitely come after your husband's wages, subject to limitations.\n\nHOW to PROCEED!!! Call the Bank immediately or contact a foreclosure attorney here in CA to work out a plan with the lender.",
        "Unfortunately, while it used to be the case that mortgage lenders rarely pursued deficiency judgments, that was because there was not normally any need to do so. In most places real estate values were relatively stable, and lenders did not lend more than 80 percent of a conservative apprasial of the value. Anything over 80 percent was insured, so as long as the lender was able to realize approximately 80 of the value of the property value through foreclosure, it worked out about right.\n\nHowever, things have changed drastically. Many loans are significantly upside down, due to the poor underwriting and risk evaluation processes the lenders utilized, and due to downright fraud by mortgage brokers and originators. The result is a never seen before scenario where large numbers of loans are seriously undersecured, default rates are skyrocketing, and when the lenders do take the properties back in foreclosure, they can't sell them easily, and have to take even lower prices, increasing even more the difference between the price ultimately realized for the property and the total amount due from the borrower. To the total loan amount gets added all the costs of taking, maintaining and selling the property. I know of many people who are tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of dollars upside down.\n\nTo complicate matters even more, as a direct result of this situation, banks are in serious financial trouble themselves.

    "title": "I will renew my Green Card soon, and I have a very large amount in credit cards debt. Is it going to affect my Green Card?",
    "question": "These debts are all past due and going to collection, and I have no way of making payments at the moment. Can I loose my Green Card because of this? I'm also my husband's sponsor on his green card. Would these debts affect him also?",
    "answers": [
        "Credit Card Debts including past due debts will not affect your green card status or your husband as his sponsor.",
        "Your credit worthiness is not a basis to lose one's green card or adversely affect your husband's green card.",
        "Having past-due credit card debt is not a reason to lose a green card or be deported.",
        "Has your husband already been granted his permanent residency, or is his application still pending?"

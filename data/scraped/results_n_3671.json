        "Ok! Lots of good stuff here. First start off with the idea that assets and debts are valued as of the date of Trial unless you file a Notice of Alternative Evaluation Date so you may make the argument at trial for the $100,000 mortgage. Then we need to take a look at who has been residing in the house since separation. Just you? Then the idea is that you could be hit with a Watts charge for the use of the community interest in the residence. Imagine that this community asset could have been rented to a stranger and that stranger would have paid rent that would have paid down the mortgage. well, now you are the tenant essentially renting the community residence from the community. Wife would also have benefited from the use of the asset and the $90,000 would be the number. Scenario # 2 and # 3- just she is in the house or she is in the house with you. Oftentimes, payments made on the residence during separation are deemed payments in lieu of support. I would be interested in seeing if there is a support order in place and the terms. Best defense is an offense. Is she exclusively in the house? Then I would find out what the house would rent for and charge her for the fair market rental value (Watts charge). Another question: who is giving the tax write off? Get your documents together, this is going long. I am reminded why we have conferences. Jenn",
        "The property is valued at a time that is as close to trial as possible according to California Family Law unless there is a good cause to have a different valuation time. You still have the right to get reimbursed for you separate property contribution towards community debt per Family Code 2640",
        "You might have a right to a reimbursement for payments you made on a CP house. Calculate the payments made and then request for a reimbursement."

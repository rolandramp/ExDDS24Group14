    "title": "How can I recover wages garnished before bankruptcy. Chapter 7 in California?",
    "question": "I was having my gages garnished and had a court hearing for a claim of exeptiona that I missed and the judge ordered for funds to be released to creditor plus $90 each pay check. Filed bk a week later. Garnishment stopped but claimed the wages garnished on my exemption form. How do I recover that money?",
    "answers": [
        "I have been successful in recovering wages garnished within the 90 days before the bankruptcy was filed in bankruptcy cases where my client was able to exempt the funds and the trustee was not interested in collecting them. What I do in cases involving wages garnished within the 90 days before bankruptcy is we list the garnished wages as an asset on Schedule B and exempt them on Schedule C (assuming we have available exemptions). I then will send a letter to the trustee asking if they will be administering the estate and if they have any objection to the Debtor's counsel (me) recovering those wages on behalf of the Debtor. I have not had a Trustee say no, but it depends on your situation and the Trustee. Certainly the smaller the amount of garnished wages, the less likely the Trustee will be interested. Once I have the trustee's go-ahead, I send the creditor a demand letter - telling them that per Title 11, USC Sections 522(h) and 547, they must return the wages to the Debtor. So far I have not failed to get the wages back. As I said, this is a case by case situation; the facts of my clients' cases may be vastly different that yours. Also, not all creditors are so cooperative, and in some cases it may be necessary to recover the wages by filing a motion with the court and getting an order from the judge.",
        "I understand that you want to claim them as an exempt asset, put the toothpaste back in the tube so to speak. That is an interesting approach. I have a strong feeling that they are gone, but may be claimed by the trustee as a preferential transfer to the judgment creditor who got them. The trustee may make that creditor pay them back to the trustee to be distributed pro rata to all creditors. I think that this will be treated as a pre-petition payment to one creditor and I believe that the state court judge's ruling that the garnished wages were non-exempt and subject to collection is going to control.",
        "You won't be able to. The right to seek the wages that have been garnished by the wage garnishment now belongs to the Chapter 7 bankruptcy trustee. However, since you apparently failed to appear for the hearing on the claim of exemptions, there is nothing that the Chapter 7 trustee can or will do.",
        "Well, while not diving into specifics because I am unaware of the nature of the underlying claim/debt that gave rise to the judgment against you, I will only provide some general ideas.\n\nTo begin with, the filing of a bankruptcy petition creates what is known as a \"cleavage date.\" This is an dividing line between your pre-petition assets and debts and your post-petition assets and debts. The filing of the petition also creates a \"bankruptcy estate\" composed of all your legal and equitable assets and liabilities. In a Chapter 7, the Trustee appointed in the case, by operation of law, takes title to your bankruptcy estate. This would include your pre-petition wages as well. What this means is that everything you own falls under the Trustee's control in a Chapter 7. In exchange, you are allowed to claim \"exempt\" certain items of personal and real property in order to benefit from a fresh start, or at least, that was Congress' intent when they drafted these code. Wages, in this sense are personal property.\n\nIn a Chapter 7, the trustee is bound by the bankruptcy code to administer your estate for the benefit of all creditors. The judgment creditor who garnished your wages was apparently the first in line to take. I have to assume that you had other creditors as well since filing merely to discharge one lone creditor would not make sense, given the dreadful impact on your credit score soon after entry of discharge.\n\nDepending on \"when\" the creditor took your money, the trustee would be able to \"avoid\" the transaction (i.e., the wage garnishment) as a \"preference\" if this creditor took, while others did not, within 90 days of your petition filing date. However, the trustee would then take possession of the recovered funds for a possible distribution to unsecured creditors. Because the property taken from you, albeit, against your will, was property of the estate, the trustee would keep it, unless you found a way to classify it under some kind of exemption found in California state law. Also, a lien attaching to wages during the preference period is avoidable even where the garnishment was levied prior to the preference period.\n\nIn practical terms, this would mean that you would not be able to recover these funds in the most likely scenario. However, if the amount is negligible, the trustee may not even bother going through the hassle of suing that judgment creditor for a return of your funds.\n\nAfter the filing date, your judgment creditor would have to seek permission from the court in order to pursue further collection action against you. I have yet to see this for mere wage garnishments, though I have seen it for landlords desiring to recover apartments, lenders and other secured creditors, like auto lenders. So going forward, I would expect for the $90 per each paycheck garnishment to end.\n\nIn conclusion, I would say, don't get your hopes of high thinking you can get the money back. I have only seen money returned once from a wage garnishment, but that was in the context of a Chapter 13 case. I couldn't say why that happened, but sometimes there are unexpected results even when the law is believed to be clear. Good Luck.\n\n**This is just general legal information, not advice to your specific case. There is no attorney-client relationship between the myself or the questioner**"

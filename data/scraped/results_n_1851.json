        "Yes, a debt that you owe can certainly be sent to a collections agency with just your name and address, without your social security number. It is not clear in what context you are asking this question. However, as Attorney Lysle warns, you need to be careful about providing information to anyone who purports to be a debt collector.",
        "Who is \"they\"? If a debt collector says anything, he/she is saying whatever he/she thinks will get you to send money. I would suggest that you do not tell them anything about you. Do not confirm your address, your age, etc.\n\nA creditor can send any account to a collection agency. What they can do after that depends upon how much information they have. Without your social, it may be difficult for the credit reporting agency to verify that you are the correct person.\n\nJust tell the collector that you do not want to receive any collection communications. Then, send a letter saying that you do not want to receive phone calls or letters. If they ignore your request (and you sent it certified mail), you can sue them for violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act.",
        "Yes. Creditor may send limited information to collection agency. No requirement that SSN be provided. Sending only name, address and date of birth is permissible.",
        "A collection agency that has privileges with the credit reporting bureaus can report anything they want. They do not need an SSN.\n\nAlso, they have to be truthful about the debt they report. And if it is in doubt as to whether it is your debt or someone else's that happens to have your name too, then that's a possibility for a Fair Credit Reporting Act dispute and potential lawsuit.\n\nBut in general, they only need a name and current address, and a date of birth."

        "As Robert points out, if you get the job after the bankruptcy is filed, non-issue.\n\nThe only caveat is whether the job offer was intentionally delayed so as to occur after the bankruptcy is filed so the debtor could qualify for chapter 7 bankruptcy. That doesn't sound like your scenario.",
        "Probably nothing you should worry about. The means test, etc all look to income before you file. There may be a good faith argument if you intentionally made less until after your bankruptcy, but that doesn't appear to be an issue here.\n\nGood luck!",
        "Generally speaking, if you get a higher paying job after the bankruptcy petition has been FILED, it will not change anything, especially if you are still below the median. The income used, for means test purposes, is the six months leading up to FILING, not DISCHARGE. If your income changes before filing, then the schedules will have to be amended, but it still should not change anything, assuming you are still below median income. If you have any questions, let a bankruptcy attorney assist you and review the specifics of your case."

        "It depends on what type of secured claim you are referring to.\nIRS secured claims typically receive 4%, judgment lien creditors typically receive 10%, and the LA County Tax Collector receives 18% (the non-bankruptcy or State law default interest rates required pursuant to Bankruptcy Code Section 1325(e)).\nFor claims secured by personal property collateral (vehicles, etc.) 9th circuit case law requires that the creditor receive the prime rate plus a risk factor of 1 to 3%.\nHome loan arrears get 0%.\nYou should consult an experienced attorney regarding motions to avoid certain secured claims and to bifurcate claims that are partially secured which require separate motions.",
        "You can put down the contract rate, or something less if you so choose. This may or may not bring an objection from the creditor.",
        "Sounds like you are representing yourself w/o an attorney's help. This could be a big mistake because according to statistics from the US Trustee's Office, almost all non-lawyer filed cases get dismissed. Some attorneys will represent you with little or no money upfront because the system allows you to make payments toward the attorney fees as part of the Chapter 13 Plan. This removes any reason that the debtor \"cannot afford\" to pay the attorney fees. Some of us offer a free consultation by phone or in person. Take us up on it before going any further. That said, the general rule on interest rates for secured debts is the contract rate for each particular secured lender."

        "If you have lived in CA more than 2 years and move to AR you must file in CA until 91 days have passed after you have moved.\n\nSecondly, you must in such event use CA exemptions until you have lived in AR for 2 years !! Only after 2 years can you use AZ exemptions.\n\nThird, an attorney can advise you if all your assets are exempt in CA and an attorney can advise you in AZ . But both will be using the CA exemptions if in fact you file bankruptcy less than 2 years after you move to AZ and have lived in CA the last 2 years or more.\n\nLastly, because you are asking that question means you have NOT sat down with an experienced bankruptcy attorney and need to do so. Many issues and facts can affect your case which I will point out next so you know you really need counselling!\n\nYou need and want to enjoy your fresh start also. But the most important thing is to meet with an attorney as you asking this question means you have not. You care about 2 goals: keeping everything you have equity in and discharging all your debts. If you don't have any of the exceptions to discharge you will obtain that goal; most exceptions are set forth in 11 USC. 523 (Google it) like child support, some income taxes, traffic (in a ch 7) and criminal fines , and presumption of student loans. But some debts are dischargeable in a ch 13 but NOT in a ch 7 so you want to make sure and your attorney will discuss any such types with you also!\n\nYour exemptions depend on what state you have lived in in the last 2 years and thus if in your state, then your states exemptions will apply. Most persons filing keep everything they own but your attorney will confirm that with you when they learn everything you own and the equity thereof!\n\nSome secured debts like homes, vehicles, other secured debts an attorney will discuss your options on also as you must list any debts; but that does not mean you will lose them unless you have too much equity or are in default on paying for them! Discuss those options if they apply with your attorney too.\n\nBut other issues can arise that can greatly harm your case. Just one example: If you paid back a relative $3,000 11 months ago and now file bankruptcy next week, the trustee can SUE that relative to retrieve that $3,000 (under what is called a preference) for the benefit of the bankruptcy estate. As a result, most attorneys don't charge to meet with them the first meeting so meet with one no matter what.\n\nMany great attorneys can be found right here on AVVO in your state so look, call, and meet one as soon as you can.\n\nYou should also want to know when to file: is there an advantage of waiting versus filing now and who should you pay between now and then! Good luck and enjoy your later fresh start.",
        "You may want to file in the jurisdiction where you are living at the time since you will be required to attend a hearing in-person within 30-40 days after filing your bankruptcy petition. Regardless the jurisdiction where you file, however, you will be using exemptions based on your residence in the state of California (unless waiting for more than 180 days after moving).",
        "It will probably be more convenient for you to file in Arizona, but you can file in California up until you have lived in Arizona for 90 days. You will have to attend the Trustee's Meeting wherever your case is filed.",
        "Preferred place to file is up to you. Not much difference in applicable exemption rules.\nReview with BK counsel in Petaluma before moving to determine most advantageous time and place to file BK.",
        "Until you've been in Arizona for 91 days, you would need to file in California (and attend the 341 creditors meeting in California). After that you would need to file in Arizona. In either case, the exemptions you could claim would probably be California exemptions (assuming that you lived in California for 3 1/2 years or more if you first moved to Arizona) which may be more beneficial to you than Arizona exemptions.\n\nIf you need to file bankruptcy sooner than waiting 91 days after you move to Arizona, think about filing here in California before you move."

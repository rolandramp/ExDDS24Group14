        "My colleagues are correct, but please get an experienced BK lawyer to help you with this. Remember, BK is more than checking boxes on forms you find online. Find/consult/hire a lawyer using the Avvo feature \"Find a Lawyer\". Make a list of 4-5 having many 5 star reviews from satisfied clients. If you don't get a prompt call back from one, go on to the next on your list. Some of us offer a free consultation by phone or in person. Take us up on it.\n\nBecause the bankruptcy process can be handled entirely by phone, email and fax, there is no need to personally visit the lawyer’s office unless you want to. Don’t be limited by the location of the BK lawyers you select.",
        "I agree with my peers. You do not need to file a responsive pleading in the collections case. Ensure you have included the creditor and its law firm in your schedules, statement of financial fffairs, and the creditor mailing matrix.",
        "You do not need to file an Answer to the Complaint once the bk is filed. Provide bankruptcy case filing info to the attorney for the creditor. Put them on notice that a case has been commenced.",
        "You do not have to file a response with the Court, however, I would file a notice of stay, form CM-180, and attach a copy of your petition face page that you filed with the bankruptcy court to the CM-180. This is in addition to listing the creditor in your schedules so they receive notice of your bankruptcy filing. This will alert the Court as well that you have filed a bankruptcy."

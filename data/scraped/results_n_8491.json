    "title": "If I don't reaffirm a secured loan during my bankruptcy and I receive my discharge, am I still liable for the debt?",
    "question": "I filed for Chapter 7, have a boat loan and considered keeping the boat. I discussed the reaffirmation with my attorney at the time, but we never completed the reaffirmation paperwork during the bankruptcy. I subsequently received my discharge paperwork. It's been about a month and a half since my discharge date. I don't want to keep the boat and frankly can't afford it. So am I still responsible for the debt or am I still protected under my BK? I have been keeping up with the payments but can't continue that for much longer. What are my options/consequences?",

        "The bankruptcy discharged your personal obligation to pay. If you do not pay the boat loan, the creditor can take the boat and sell it. You will have no further responsibility.\n\n[This communication is intended as general information and not specific legal advice, and this communication does not create an attorney-client relationship.]",
        "As long as you did not reaffirm the loan on the boat, you will not be personally liable on the note. The bank can repossess the boat at any time without lifting the automatic stay since its no longer in effect. Any debt you incurred before your filing date is discharged (with some exceptions of course).",
        "Once a Bankruptcy discharge has been granted, your creditors no longer have the right to object to your bankruptcy. So although the lender can repossess the boat (because they have kept the title to it), they can't force you to pay for it.\n\nGood luck!",
        "As long as the lender was properly notified of the of bankruptcy, they did not get an order declaring the debt non-dischargeable for some reason, and you did not sign the reaffirmation agreement, you are not liable for the loan. Depending on the details of California law, you should be able to keep boat as long as you keep making payments. If you stop making payments, they will repossess the boat very quickly. But, you will not be responsible for the balance due on the loan."

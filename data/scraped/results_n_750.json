    "question": "My house is paid off and worth $250K. I have a declared homestead that gives us $175K. I have $100K in 3 year old credit card debt. Recently, two debt buyers have got judgements against me. Is there anything I can do? If not, how long will we be homeless before we receive the 175K from the homestead to purchase another house?",

        "Your debt collectors with judgments against may slap liens on house but they shouldn't foreclose (very rare). So being homeless doesn't sound like a serious threat with these facts. Generally it's mortgage liens that foreclose in Cali, not judicial liens. When you go and sell house in future, if creditors slapped liens on house, they will get paid. To avoid this, file BK, but with unprotected equity, trustee may want to liquidate, cut you a check for $175K (if you properly exempted) good towards purchase of another house. Or go Ch 13, pay back creditors the unprotected equity portion (over 5 years max, 0% interest) and be done with them. But you have to show the ability to pay them. Example with this facts: $250K value. 8% sales cost = $20K (if anyone were to sell house). $230K net equity - $175K exempted (if disabled, over certain age, retirement age, etc etc, CCCP 704) = $55K unprotected asset worth. Means in Ch 13 you're paying min $55K over 5 years = $916/month (and don't forget to add trustee fee of 11% and any attorney fees). So maybe $1K/month in Ch 13, you keep your house with NO liens and pay back half your debt. Otherwise, settle with judgment creditors at 30 cents on dollar and hope the others you owe money to don't take their place in line. $100K in unsecured debt is nothing to sneeze at. Good news you have value in your stuff. Bad news you have debt you need to contend with. But there are ways out of everything without going homeless. That's sounds like an extreme scenario that I simply don't see happening (but life it full of surprises I suppose).",
        "Sounds like you did not contest the creditor's claim. If you had, the attorney could provide you with an answer. The creditor has to initiate an action to sell your homesteaded property.

        "I strongly suggest you sit down with an experienced bankruptcy attorney in CA to discuss all the facts which is beyond this type of forum.

But the most important thing is to meet with an attorney as you asking this question means you have not. You care about 2 goals: keeping everything you have equity in and discharging all your debts. If you don't have any of the exceptions to discharge you will obtain that goal; most exceptions are set forth in 11 USC. 523 (Google it) like child support, some income taxes, traffic (in a ch 7) and criminal fines , and presumption of student loans.

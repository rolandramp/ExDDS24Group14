    "title": "Can a creditor refuse payment in full?",
    "question": "My corporation was sued for an outstanding debt on which we were making payments. The creditor filed a small claims case even though we were current with the agreed upon payments. The creditor was paid the entire suit amount 2 weeks prior to the court date. The creditor refused the payment because we did not pay for the filing and service costs and he received a default judgment. I have filed a motion to vacate. Can the creditor legally demand payment in excess of the suit amount? Can the creditor refuse payment and continue to charge interest? Does my motion to vacate have a chance?",
    "answers": [
        "A court may award the costs of bringing suit, including fees for filing suit & service + the underlying debt.\n\nYou offered payment in full to the \"Creditor\"' but you did not tender payment in full to the\nLitigant.",
        "If the creditor had reason to sue and prevailed on the merits absent the default judgment, the creditor is entitled to recover statutory interest and costs, if awarded by the court, and could refuse anything less.",
        "Yes. The creditor can legally demand payment in full including costs and fees. Until the full amount due is paid any interests or fees are still applicable.",
        "It will be up to the judge to decide if the creditor's reason for refusing your payment was legitimate. If you had an agreement with the creditor that you never breached, then it is unlikely that the creditor will be able to obtain the additional money sought for court fees.\n\nBut I have learned you can never predict what the evidence might be or what a judge might do.\n\nHope this perspective helps!"

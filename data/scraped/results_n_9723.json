    "title": "What happens to my home in Chapter 7 Bankruptcy?",
    "question": "I have a home with a first and second mortgage on it. Both mortgages are undersecured, meaning that they both exceed the current value of the home. I owe a lot of money on credit cards and other unsecured debt. I lost my job about a year ago and my savings have been exhausted. What I want to know now is if the credit cards and unsecured debt can be discharged in CH 7 and whether the first and second mortgages can be discharged? I feel I am responsible for this financial mismanagement and so I would want the bank to take back the house and foreclose on it so they can get something back, but I would like a FRESH start so that I don't owe anything to anybody after filing for CH7. THANKS!!!!!!",

        "In a Chapter 7 those debts would all appear dischargeable (unless an exception such as recent purachases of luxury goods, cash advances applies). The security interests remain but if the property is being foreclosed that is of no consequence.\n\nIn a Chapter 13 you might be able to recharacterize the 2nd as unsecured and pay it off at a big discount through the Ch 13 plan."

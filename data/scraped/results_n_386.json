        "First, when did you file? An emergency petition means the \"bare-bones\" petition was filed without the required additional documents. When that occurs, the clerk of the court automatically sets a 14 day deadline to file the remaining documents, or alternatively a request for additional time in the form of an ex parte application to extend deadline. Without knowing when that deadline falls, even experienced attorneys cannot tell you what step needs to be taken immediately.",
        "You are wise to get a BK lawyer to help you. You can get a good one through Avvo. Remember, BK is more than checking boxes on forms you find online. Find/consult/hire a lawyer using the Avvo feature \"Find a Lawyer\". Make a list of 4-5 having many 5 star reviews from satisfied clients. If you don't get a prompt call back from one, go on to the next on your list. Some of us offer a free consultation by phone or in person. Take us up on it.\n\nBecause the bankruptcy process can be handled entirely by phone, email and fax, there is no need to personally visit the lawyer’s office unless you want to. Don’t be limited by the location of the BK lawyers you select.",
        "Use the Find a Lawyer tab for an experienced bankruptcy attorney in your area.",
        "I recommend calling some experienced bankruptcy attorney with good reviews from Avvo. You can speak to a couple of them and listen to their guidance and advice. I would go with the one you are most comfortable with and is the most competent and experienced with bankruptcy. Bankruptcy is a specialized practice area so it is important to go with an attorney who specializes in bankruptcy."

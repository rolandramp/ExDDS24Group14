    "title": "Vehicle repossessed, can I file chapter 7?",
    "question": "My mom is the applicant and I am the co-applicant on our vehicle which has recently been repossessed. My mom has been needing to file Chapter 7 for about three months now but we have tried to avoid it. I lost my job last year as well and would also be applicable for chapter 7. My mom has a steady income but not enough for Chapter 13. I've read that filing Chapter 13 could get the vehicle back, but in our case we can't file Chapter 13. I'm due to start a new job in two weeks, but in that time, the bank will probably sell the vehicle at auction. Can my mom continue with filing Chapter 7 and will that help in getting the vehicle back?",

        "Your financial situation is all too familiar these days and quite unfortunate. Chapter 13 Bankruptcy is the only way to recover the vehicle and should be done immediately to prevent the sale of the vehicle. Whether you mother qualifies depends on many factors and not just her income. You would probably qualify for Chapter 7 and should file before your income increases with your new job.\n\nYou should call an attorney in your area immediately to schedule and appointment to discuss your options.\n\nThe Danville Law Group provides financial advice to individuals and small businesses in Northern California.",

        "Only a chapter 13 will get the vehicle back. I recommend that YOU file the chapter 13 prior to the sale of the vehicle by the lender. While I can't promise anything, you really SHOULD be able to get a case confirmed based on your prospective income. The confirmation hearing will not be for 4-6 weeks, and if you have provable income then, that should do the trick!\n\nStuart Price\nPrice Law Group\nOffices throughout California\n800 884 6000 x1232",
        "I'm sorry to hear about the recent financial troubles that you and your Mom have been facing lately. Chapter 7 is something that I think the both of you should consider as it appears that you are not able to meet your monthly payments. To get your vehicle back, you may need to take action quickly. By doing so, you could convince the lender to stop the foreclosure sale on the vehicle and try to qualify it as exempt or reaffirm that you will continue making payments on it after the bankruptcy proceeding has completed. If you do not have a chapter 7 filed soon, or if you are unable to get the vehicle back, the foreclosure will occur on your vehicle and you will most likely be liable for the whole debt that the vehicle secured. Meaning, you still will have to owe money to the bank even though they already took your car. Thus, the repo will not end your problems with them and they will become even more of a nuisance. Look into filing for a chapter 7, and also be aware of the difficulties of having both your names on the lending agreement as they could try and get around the bankruptcy and come after each one of you individually. Good luck with everything, and remember, bankruptcy is sometimes a good choice."

        "This is one of those instances where legal theory and reality conflict.\n\nI can envision making an argument that this is an acceptable use of the B-1/B-2 visitor visa based more or less on the argument you make - that this is similar to a foreign businessperson coming here and answering e-mails from their laptop while here. Further, an employee of an overseas company can enter on a visitor visa to perform \"after-sales service\" on a product sold to a U.S. company pursuant to a contract between the U.S. and foreign entity - your work with U.S. clients might allow for this if working on their sites her pursuant to contract.\n\nIn practice, though, I think that this will be a hard sell to an immigration officer at a border or to an adjudicating officer looking at a future petition. For one thing, the length of the trip doesn't look like a brief business trip, but more like an extended stay requiring a work visa. For another, the after-sales service situation requires that the contract not specific a particular worker to provide the service; tough to argue if you are a one-person shop and it is implied that you would do the work.\n\nSo, I would have to advise against going this route - at least for this long.\n\nSpeak with an attorney about alternatives.",

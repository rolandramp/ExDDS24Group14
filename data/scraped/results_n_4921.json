        "I agree with Mr. Steingraber that if this is a trust fund penalty the officers and or responsible persons can be held liable for a portion of the taxes. However, I believe this is a income tax issue and not a trust fund penalty issue.\n\nShareholders of the S corporation can't be held liable for the debts of the S corporation.\nOne exception is where distributions were made to the shareholders in exchange for less than adequate consideration, the IRS can hold the shareholders liable as transferees of the S corporation under Sec. 6901. But usually, the liability must be fairly large before the IRS will pursue collection under this section.",
        "Since you elected S-Corp status, the adjusted gross income flows through to the shareholder(s) ... who is/are more responsible than the \"officers\" to pay the taxes.",
        "The short answer is \"yes\". One authority says the taxing authorities can assess company’s taxes due personally against the company’s “responsible persons”—those who controlled the company’s available cash, and used it to pay debts other than taxes. In the Federal scheme, such an assessment is called a “trust fund recovery penalty.” It consists of Federal income tax and Social Security tax withheld by the company from employees’ wages but not remitted to the Internal Revenue Service. It excludes employer matching Social Security tax, as well as penalties and interest accrued on the unpaid tax. From the time a trust fund recovery penalty is assessed, the IRS has ten years to collect it. A Federal tax lien encumbers all property owned by the responsible person at the time the trust fund recovery penalty is assessed, or acquired by the responsible person during the ensuing ten years. The IRS records notice of the Federal tax lien in the register of deeds’ office of the county of the responsible person’s residence. In addition to disabling the responsible person from selling or mortgaging interests in real property, and impairing the responsible person’s credit, a notice of tax lien recorded against a responsible person may affect his or her ability to secure new employment. A trust fund recovery penalty is not dischargeable in bankruptcy."

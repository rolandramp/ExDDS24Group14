        "As Ms. Estes says, there are two competing claims for reimbursement. One is the reimbursement of community debts, such as the mortgage, taxes, etc., which is what you've asked about.\n\nThe other is reimbursement for the fair rental value for exclusive use of the community property house. This is determined by subtracting expenses for the house (such as those same mortgage, taxes, etc.) from the market rental value. If this number is negative then forget about it, but if this number is positive, then there is a net fair rental value to living there.\n\nThink of it this way: If you moved out, too, and you rented the place to a tenant. You would both be landlords, and the net rents would be community income that would need to be split. But in this case, it is YOU are is the \"tenant\" and by living their you are saving money on the apartment that you would otherwise have been renting for yourself. So, instead, you owe \"rent\" to the marital community.\n\nBe careful what you ask for in court, as it could come back to bite you!",
        "There are something called Epstein/Watts credits/reimbursements that come into play here. You should seek legal assistance on this matter. You can't be compensated when you file but you can ask for it when you file and any decision will be made at a trial if the two of you can't come to an agreement on this issue.",
        "It depends upon the specific situation. The facts and circumstance vary for each individual case and are made by a court on a case by case basis. I would recommend that you meet with counsel to determine what you might need.",
        "Yes, it is possible. However, you need to place the other party on notice that you will be seeking reimbursement for them, in writing.\n\nKeep in mind that they may not be as high as you think. To determine how much should or would be reimbursed (this is discretionary on the part of the court) you need to know exactly how much the expense is for the house, and how much a similar house would rent for. For example, the house expense is $1000 per month, and a similar house would rent for $1500 per month. The community is losing money by you living in the home in that example. You would owe him half the difference, or $250 per month. If it were the opposite, and the house would rent for LESS than what is being paid; i.e. house expense is $1500 but it would rent for $1000, then the other spouse owes you the $250 per month.\n\nI hope that helps!"

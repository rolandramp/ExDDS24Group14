        "If I understand your posting, you believe that a creditor sold your defaulted account twice. If true, that would be fraud, both against you and against the second company that purchased the account. Your payment of the first company is a defense to the second (and third and fourth) collectors. I hope you have something in writing from the first company showing you settled this account with them.\n\nGEMB is a large company with may accounts. Hopefully, you are certain you had only one account with them. You may want to check your credit reports to verify the status of your credit and who has been looking at it. Below is a link to free credit reports once per year, as permitted by Federal law.\n\nIf you are correct, then you should dispute the second company, using one of the free letters on my web site, which is in the second link, below. Send letter 1.1 by Certified Mail, return receipt requested, which will help you protect your rights under the Fair Debt Collection Practice Act."

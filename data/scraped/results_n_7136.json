    "title": "Should I include proceeds from a personal injury settlement in my means test?",
    "question": "I filed for bankruptcy in January, 2012 and received a settlement for personal injuries from an automobile accident in November 2011. Jointly my husband and I only made $19,720.00 last year and we filed pro se. We are now wondering if we should amend our means test to include the settlement as income. It won't change anything, but just so the funds are included.",

        "I would list as income but footnote as follows:\n\n1. x amount is income as compensation for lost wages/earnings.\n\n2. x amount is compensation for medical injury.\n\nI would tend to think that if the compensation is for medical injury only it may not be counted against you as income for purposes of the means test, but further research on that issue would be needed.\n\nIt would definitely go on schedule B as an asset.\n\nBW",
        "Yes, include this as income.",
        "I think you do have to count this as income for means test purposes, though because it is a one time occurence, an argument can be made that you should not have to count it because it is not going to recur in the future. Nonetheless, it should be reported on Schedule B, or at least whatever funds you have remaining from the settlement and should also be claimed as exempt on schedule C if possible under your state law. Here in NC settlements from personal injury are exempt but I strongly recommend you keep those funds separate from your regular income to safeguard them. I would strongly recommend you consult with a bankruptcy attorney in your area to verify whether you can exempt those funds from the claims of your creditors and your trustee.",
        "Yes, it belongs on the means test as a component of current monthly income. Whatever you have left is an asset that needed to be (and probably was, if I correctly read between the lines) disclosed on Sch B. The settlement amount would also have been disclosed in the answer to question 2 on the Statement of Financial Affairs.",
        "Technically, this is considered income for Chapter 7 purposes and you have to include it. Furthermore, the cash settlement is also an asset and must be exempted. Finally, you may also have to include the settlement under the Statement of Financial Affairs.\n\nEven if a one time disbursement of income will make you fail the means test for Chapter 7, some judges will allow you to file for Chapter 7 because a one-time settlement is considered an \"extenuating circumstance\" which shows to the court that you are not abusing the bankruptcy process.\n\nHowever, you shouldn't have anything to worry about if the settlement is not large enough to affect your means test. Just include it because full disclosure is very important in the bankruptcy process."

    "title": "Ex-husband forged my signature on 2 huge bank loans. How do I get my name off the judgements entered in CO and CA?",
    "question": "In 2007 my now ex-husband took out a number of large bank loans in Colorado to fund investment activities I was not aware of. Several years ago I learned he had forged my name to 2 of these loans as a co-signer, and now I have judgments totaling over 1.3 Million entered in my name in both CO and CA (we moved to CA in 2009). The ex claimed he was going to negotiate the payoff of these loans when the investment deals paid out and get my name off the loans first. You can guess the rest of this story. Seven years later the loans haven't been paid and the investment deals have gone bad so he has no money for repayment and I can't buy a house or a car or invest anything because of the judgments.",

        "Your remedies are limited if you knew about the forgery and did not promptly take action. Now that judgments have been entered, it will be necessary to set aside the judgments. You might be able to do this if you did not receive notice of these lawsuits and if you act promptly (i.e., immediately).\n\nIf the judgments allege fraud, BK may not be available to you. You should have a BK lawyer review the documents and get the facts.\n\nYou can always sue your ex. If you win, you will have a civil judgment which may probably be uncollectable.\n\nIt is time for you to meet with a lawyer, pay for an hour of attorney time, and have the lawyer review all of the relevant documents and legal papers.",

        "If the goal is to absolve your liability for the debt; frankly, the path of least resistance may be a bankruptcy. The main questions right now are when did you find out about the forged signatures; why didn't you take action at that point; why didn't you take action when the lawsuits were \"filed\" etc. The main hurdle you may face is your apparent acquiescence. My concern based on the way you describe the situation is that many years have passed since you found out about the forgery; as such, any claim or defense you may have had against the debt may be considered waived by affirmation since you took no action to correct the situation when you discovered it.\n\nIn any event, you need to sit down with a lawyer, (maybe a bankruptcy lawyer, or general civil lawyer) and sort out your options. However, it sounds like you have known about the forgery for some time and are now only trying to deal with it, which is a problem. That is why it would probably be easier and less costly to file bankruptcy. But, you need an attorney that can review the entire case and help you make a decision.",

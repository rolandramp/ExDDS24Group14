    "title": "In a CA bankruptcy chapter 7, can I person protect an annuity that was set up from a workers comp case years ago? Pays monthly",
    "question": "So my friend (who is planning on hiring an attorney) is contemplating the idea of filing a chapter 7 to deal with her debts which are getting out of control. She has no other assets and her only other income is social security. What, if any, statute would she be able to use to protect this annuity. It was set up as part of her settlement after a bad work injury many years ago. It pays her a $9,000 lump sum once a year and also about $1700 each month.",

        "By now you have seen the answers. I will point out NO ATTORNEY can know all your exemptions until they know if the friend has lived in CA for more than 2 years or else some other states laws may in fact govern the exemptions too. Other issues and facts can affect your friends case so I will point out some of those for her now.\n\nYou need and want to enjoy your fresh start also. But the most important thing is to meet with an attorney as you asking this question means you have not. You care about 2 goals: keeping everything you have equity in and discharging all your debts. If you don't have any of the exceptions to discharge you will obtain that goal; most exceptions are set forth in 11 USC. 523 (Google it) like child support, some income taxes, traffic (in a ch 7) and criminal fines , and presumption of student loans. But some debts are dischargeable in a ch 13 but NOT in a ch 7 so you want to make sure and your attorney will discuss any such types with you also!\n\nYour exemptions depend on what state you have lived in in the last 2 years and thus if in your state, then your states exemptions will apply. Most persons filing keep everything they own but your attorney will confirm that with you when they learn everything you own and the equity thereof!\n\nSome secured debts like homes, vehicles, other secured debts an attorney will discuss your options on also as you must list any debts; but that does not mean you will lose them unless you have too much equity or are in default on paying for them! Discuss those options if they apply with your attorney too.\n\nBut other issues can arise that can greatly harm your case. Just one example: If you paid back a relative $3,000 11 months ago and now file bankruptcy next week, the trustee can SUE that relative to retrieve that $3,000 (under what is called a preference) for the benefit of the bankruptcy estate. As a result, most attorneys don't charge to meet with them the first meeting so meet with one no matter what.\n\nMany great attorneys can be found right here on AVVO in your state so look, call, and meet one as soon as you can.\n\nYou should also want to know when to file: is there an advantage of waiting versus filing now and who should you pay between now and then! Good luck and enjoy your later fresh start.",
        "Exempting annuities can be a very involved matter, depending upon why the annuity was purchased, what it was to be used for, and how it is set up. Your friend needs to sit down with an experienced bankruptcy attorney to ensure that she qualifies to file and that she won't lose her annuity if she does so.\nDiscovering issues AFTER filing can result in the loss of her annuity and her income.",

        "She needs to seek a QUALIFIED AND REPUTABLE bankruptcy attorney with experience in evaluating annuities. I've had clients tell me they had an annuity from a w/comp case or personal injury, but after reviewing the annuity documents, and settlement documents, it was clear the annuity was from another source - sold their litigation rights to get money, etc. Also, there are some limitations in exemptions. Some exemptions apply to the extent it is \"reasonable and necessary.\" If your attorney does not have the experience to properly document that, she could lose the exempt status. Be careful."

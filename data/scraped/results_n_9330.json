        "The important question here is whether you are still married to your wife or divorced? If you are divorced your case is basicaly over since any petition filed on your behalf by your former spouse is automatically revoked if you never obtained your residence. if you are still married then you may still be eligible for residence, though there are many outstanding issues which need to be addressed.\n\nYou should consult with a qualified immigration attorney who can review the facts of your case and advise you as to any options that may be available to you.",

        "Get a good lawyer first. If you marriage was entered in good faith (bona fide) and you can fight the case, you should get your greencard.

        "This is why attorneys discourage joint titling of properties.\n\nI agree with Mr. Eschen: You can file a third party claim pursuant to CCP sections 720.110, et seq. Since the California Judicial Council does not provide any fill-in-the-blank forms for this type of claim, you'll need either to hire an attorney to prepare it for you, or to visit your local public law library and ask the reference librarian to help you find a form. (The Matthew Bender publications are good resources.) Mail the claim to the levying officer (usually the county sheriff) who levied the bank account. He will then send a copy to the judgment creditor, who will decide either to (1) ignore the claim and let the sheriff return the funds to the account or (2) oppose the claim and set the matter for court hearing.",
        "You should be able to prove that your funds are not your friend's funds. If you can prove this, you should be able to get your money back. You will have to be able to trace the funds to yourself and not your friend.",
        "Technically, you would file a third-party claim, for which there is no official form. Unfortunately, you would not get your money back for some time. The judgment creditor has 30 days to object to your claim. In that time, he might file a bond, which would prevent the sheriff from releasing the funds.\n\nWhen you do get your money back, you are going to put it in your new bank account in your name alone, along with all your other money."

    "title": "How do I go about suing someone for a large amount of money on someone behalf? They have stopped repayment and communication.",
    "question": "$150 000 was loaned to a friend to save his business. He sold his store and was supposed to pay back the loan. He then said he was having financial problems and could no longer pay the monthly payment or any money at all. He equated it to the sale of his store. He sold the store for $800 000, received a balloon payment of $300,000 and was awaiting the second balloon payment to pay off his loan. He says that the buyers are withholding the second payment because business has not been very lucrative. Apparently the sale between the two was partially done under the table in order to hide moneys from being taxed; therefore, my debtor says his back is against the wall and has no money left. The remainder of monies owed is $72,000. How should I proceed? Thank you",

        "Whether or not your friend is having money problems with someone else, and their shady dealdings, shouldn't be your problem, and it's not a defense to not paying you back.\n\nIf you hire a lawyer to sue your debtor, he may then feel forced to cross-complain against his buyers who owe him money, but again, this isn't your problem, and you can't, as my colleague pointed out, represent anyone else's interest in court if you're not a lawyer.\n\nYou need to assert your rights, and in CA you only have 2 years form the date of breach (the date of the last payment) to sue for breach of an oral contract, and 4 years from the date of breach for a written contract. If you do have a written contract, like a promissory note, it may also provide for a waiver of the statute of limitations, attorney's fees, interest, etc., and you can add those to your claim.\n\nDisclaimer: Please note that this answer does not constitute legal advice, and should not be relied on, since each state has different laws, each situation is fact specific, and it is impossible to evaluate a legal problem without a comprehensive consultation and review of all the facts and documents at issue. This answer does not create an attorney-client relationship.",
        "You're probably a very good friend, but I bet you would call a doctor if he needed surgery instead of trying to do the operation yourself.\n\nYou cannot sue anyone on your friend's behalf unless you are an attorney licensed to practice law in California. He needs a lawyer, but can probably use your friendship and support through the process.\n\nPlease understand that this is a general discussion of legal principles by a California lawyer and does not create an attorney/client relationship. It's impossible to give detailed, accurate advice based on a few sentences on a website (and you shouldn't provide too much specific information about your legal matter on a public forum like Avvo, anyway). You should always seek advice from an attorney licensed in your jurisdiction who can give you an informed opinion after reviewing all of the relevant information."

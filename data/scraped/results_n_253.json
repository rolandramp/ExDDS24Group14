    "question": "found a bill that i forgot to pay from back in 2014. It wasn't a large bill, around $1500. I tried to contact the company, but found that they had gone bankrupt. I was able to find the company that bought them out. I contacted them and they referred me to one of their lawyers. He told me tosend them a check for the total amount, which i am ok with doing. What I'm concerned about is will this be the end of it? Is it possible for them to try and sue me, or continue to charge me after i pay? I took on the debt while i was living in Kansas, I currently live in California. The company is located in Illinois.",

        "Unless the debt appears on your credit reports OR you were contacted by the current creditor or a debt collector, it is probably not a good idea to pay this debt. As others have mentioned, there is a statute of limitations that applies to the collection of a debt. The debt incurred in 2014 may be \"time-barred\" which means that it is too old to be collected through a lawsuit. If the statute of limitations is 5 years, it is probably time-barred. And, if the debt is more than 7 years old, and there has been no payment at all during that time, is is also too old to be reported on your credit reports.\n\nThe main reason to avoid making a time-barred debt is that you could be reviving the statute of limitations that applies to the entire debt, which may include interest, late fees, etc. Worst-case-scenario: you pay the $1,500, the statute of limitations is re-started, the creditor decides that it will attempt to extract more money from you, and may begin to report the debt to credit reporting agencies as delinquent. Best-case-scenario: you pay the $1,500 and never hear from anyone again (which is fine, but you'd have $1,500 less to spend on other things you need).",

        "It appears the debt is beyond the Statute of Limitations and therefore, uncollectible. Whatever you do, don't send them any money because that revives the debt and allows the creditor a new 4 year period to sue you.

If you did not file BK, but the creditor did, the money you owed was an asset in that case. You probably need the $1500 more than a collection agency who paid noting or pennies on the dollar to buy the debt. You are to be commended for your personal integrity for recognizing your moral obligation to pay a legally uncollectible debt.",

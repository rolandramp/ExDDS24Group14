        "If it was not filed with the original petition, you should make sure that it is attached with your Marital Settlement Agreement (MSA). Best of luck.",
        "Accord with Mr. Williams' response. A FL-160 has to be filed in connection with a default judgment so that the Court can evaluate the property and debt issues in coming to a decision. In your situation, it won't be needed.",
        "It is NOT part of the mandatory declarations of disclosure. Some local rules of Court require it. If you have a mandatory settlement conference, then you ARE required to do a Mandatory Settlement Conference brief. While personally I think that the schedule of assets and debts and the property declaration are very similar, I have NEVER not had a client do a property declaration from the beginning and it would be a good idea to attach it to your settlement conference brief as there are obvious disagreements and it can only help the process."

    "title": "Is a spouse's income considered towards satisfying a judgment entered against the other spouse in a civil lawsuit?",
    "question": "My spouse as an individual, and her company (an LLC) are currently being sued by another party. If she were to lose the suit and a monetary judgment is entered against her, could my income be used to satisfy her judgment? She has no income currently as her business is not yet profitable. We have a prenuptial for assets brought in to the marriage (we have been married for 7 years) and a Family Trust for distribution of assets upon our deaths. Is there anything I can do to protect myself since I am not a party to or named in the lawsuit?",

        "Because of community property laws, half of your income is considered to be her income. So it is possible that a creditor could come after your income & any assets you acquired during the marriage. However, this is not very likely. The creditor will only attempt to seize assets that are in joint names or are held in her name alone.\n\nIf your pre-nuptual deals with the issues of income & property ownership, record it with the county to provide public notice of the ownership of income & assets.\n\nI would urge you to consult with an attorney experienced in asset protection right away.\n\nHope this perspective helps!",
        "A spouse's wages could be garnished, but the judgment creditor must apply to the court in order to do so.\n\nSpecifically, California Code of Civil Procedure section 706.109 provides as follows: \"An earnings withholding order may not be issued against the earnings of the spouse of the judgment debtor except by court order upon noticed motion.\""

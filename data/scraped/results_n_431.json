    "title": "I received a lien on my bank account for fees I owed from criminal court from 2011 in San Diego, can I have them removed?",
    "question": "I just received a lien on my bank account for fees I owed from criminal court back in 2011 that I never have been able to pay off. I am a single mother of 3 living in California without the help of government assistance. I have terrible credit & owe even banks money because I cannot get ahead. They have tried garnishing my wages but have not been successful since I fall below the threshold. They HAVE taken from my taxes- & the money they have taken is NEVER reflected in subsequent bills nor have I received a receipt. I have not worked since graduating college & moving in 2017. The money they are asking for is $4,000 + but I have paid off one of the attorney's fees so it should be less. I want to challenge these fees & know why they have never reflected the payments I did make & ask for a reduction. I am upset is because $1000 of it is for restitution to my daughter... whom I still have joint custody of who also happens to live in Boston, MA since 2012. I'd be paying myself. My husband says he has not received a dime of the money I had been paying. I have been off of probation since 2014 I have paid for and completed all my classes and have outside of this never been in trouble.",

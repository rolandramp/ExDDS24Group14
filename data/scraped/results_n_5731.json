        "Unfortunately for your aunt and uncle, there exists a law on the books known as the \"statute of frauds\" that requires that a promise to pay the debt of another person must be reduced to a writing in order to be enforceable. An oral promise to pay the debt of another is not enforceable. Making things worse, if this loan is a qualified student loan, it is not dischargeable in bankruptcy, except upon a showing that repayment would impose an on reasonable hardship on your aunt and uncle. As far as the threats being made by the collection agency, it has no power to simply impose a lien upon property owned by your aunt and uncle, but it may pursue a lawsuit. If a judgment is obtain in that lawsuit, an abstract of the judgment can be issued and recorded in the office of the County recorder, thereby creating a judgment lien upon any real property owned in the County by your aunt and uncle. Any resolution that may assist your aunt and uncle will probably require the assistance of legal counsel.",

        "I agree with atty Kaufman. No one can just put a lien on someone's house, or any other property for that matter, without first filing and serving a lawsuit and then being sucessfull in getting a judgment. If your relatives are sued by the creditor, they can cross-complain against the friend. Or, they can choose to go ahead and file a suit against the friend now for breach of contract. I know it was a verbal agreement, but still could be enforceable as a contract breach, even a written contract breach if, for example there was any written correspondence with the friend concerning the agreement and through other means. I would suggest consulting with a local civil litigation attorney to review all the facts, pertinent paperwork, etc., to deyermine your options.",
        "The lien threat seems a bit sketchy as I'm not sure they signed their home up as collateral and I'm not sure there is any kind of judgment. That threat may in fact be unlawful. Try Bob Brennan's office in La Crescenta and tell him I said hello."

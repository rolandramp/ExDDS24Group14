    "question": "I got 2 money judgments against an individual in Santa Clara county. The person is currently self employed and making good income but is not willing to pay me anything at all. I did the debtor exam but the debtor closed all the bank accounts before the court date. The person does not have any property. It's a critical time now to collect debt on this individual since the person is consistently making good income. What strategies do you recommend? What are my best options in this case? Thank you.",

        "Good information has been provided to you. Seeking guidance and assistance from a collection attorney in your are might be something worth looking into. Also, if you did conduct a judgment debtor examination, that creates a lien on any personal assets he has which you can recover.",
        "I practice bankruptcy law for debtors, not debt collection, but as a bankruptcy attorney am very familiar with the process. There is a lot you can do, but you really need the expertise of a good collections attorney. There are many you ca find here on Avvo in your area. Another option is a non-attorney debt collection company. Generally the fee for either one will be part of what they collect for you.\n\nThere are two factors to consider in whether you might want to hire some help. First is the debtor's income. How sure are you that he has good income? If you know that he does, next you need to consider how much is owed. You seem to have done a lot of work so far, so it must be worth the effort. If it is, look into someone to collect this for you. They will find the income, the accounts, and perhaps other assets and get at least a part of your money for you.\n\nIf the debtor files bankruptcy though, you can't collect. At that point you would want to talk to and hire a bankruptcy creditor's attorney. If the debtor isn't truthful in the filing about income and assets, you can prevent the discharge from occurring. However, he better owe you a lot of money because at that point things could get expensive for you.",

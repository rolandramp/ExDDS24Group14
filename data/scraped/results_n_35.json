    "title": "If I deposit cash into my bank account after a levy has been served will the funds be accessible to me?",
    "question": "I got sued and there was a judgement on me. I’m from Orange County ca. Let’s say my judgement creditor wants to levy my bank account. From what I read, they would have to serve the writ to my bank. Let’s say they served the writ on august 8. On august 8 I only have $20 in my account. That means the sheriff can only take $20, correct? Let’s say I deposit $10000 cash on August 9. From what I understand the sheriff can’t take that $10000 unless a new writ is served to the bank on August 9. They can only take the funds that are in my account on the day the writ is served to the bank. Does that mean I can use the $10000 that I deposited in my account and would I be able to purchase items online, in store or withdraw it? Or would the bank not let me access it but keep it in there until the judgement creditor serves a new writ? Also can a judgement creditor serve multiple writs as in they serve a writ on august 8, August 9, August 10 ?",

        "The money in your acct on the day of the levy is what the creditor will get (less any fees). I am concerned that the bank defines \"day\" differently. There may be a delay between when you deposit the money and the day the bank gives you credit. In any event, get the money out of that acct ASAP. the creditor can request another levy any time they want by paying the sheriff's $40 fee. If they get the $10K you may have to file BK to get the money back.",
        "The levy only takes the money that is in the account on the day it was served, but the judgment creditor can seek levies on multiple days.",
        "OK So lets be sensible about it. Put your money into a bank that you owe no money to and that the judgment creditor knows nothing about. That way you do not have to play cat and mouse. Better still, keep it in cash and only spend cash, that way you do not have to worry about it."

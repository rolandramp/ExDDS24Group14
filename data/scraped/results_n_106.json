    "title": "Do I have to pay taxes on my S-Corp debt for which I received a 1099-c if the debt was discharged in a PERSONAL bankruptcy?",
    "question": "I filed personal bankruptcy where debts were discharged in April 2020. Included in the discharge were three S-Corp debts. I just received a 1099-c for one of them that has the corporate EIN and my social security number on it. The corporation stopped doing business in April 2020 and was dissolved in Oct 2020. I will be filing final 1120s next month. I did not file Business Bankruptcy but never heard from the lenders again after the Personal BK discharge. Will I have to pay taxes on the debt since I did not file a Business bankruptcy too?",

        "You're mixing apples and oranges here. I think you intended to ask two questions: 1. Are you personally liable for tax debts of your S-Corp. and 2. If the answer to #1 is \"yes\", then were those tax debts discharged (or dischargeable) in your personal bankruptcy case?\n\nThe answer to question 1 depends on the type of tax you are talking about. You would need to consult with a tax specialist (e.g. a certified public accountant or tax attorney) regarding your liability. Certain tax debts, such as employee payroll taxes are \"trust fund\" taxes for which the owners of the corporation are liable. Other taxes, such as income taxes for the corporation may not yield any personal liability for the owners. Sales taxes are typically assessed against the responsible parties of the corporation so that will end up as a personal liability in most cases.\n\nThe answer to question 2 again depends on whether the answer to question 1 is \"yes\" or \"no\". And, if yes, it will depend on the type of tax and a bunch of other factors including when the returns were last due to be filed, when the returns were actually filed, when the taxes were assessed, and some other factors.

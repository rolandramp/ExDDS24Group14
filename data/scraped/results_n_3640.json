    "question": "Now here I am with this summons.I don't think it's fair I am suddenly getting sued when I didnt even know this was getting to this extent. They served papers at my parents home, where I don't live and under my maiden name. My parents moved into that home 2 years ago and I've never lived there. My mother told the server that I didnt live there and that i have changed my name, she told my mother well i dont want to go back can I leave it here.",

If they do nothing other than hold this judgment, then it will sit there.\n\nIf you're concerned about this debt, when you file your motion to set aside the default and quash service, that may be sufficient enough for them to rethink things and accept a much more favorable settlement on your part.\n\nIf the debt was barred by the statute of limitations at the time the lawsuit was filed, a motion to quash will erase the judgment and the lawsuit as that will be the basis for a demurrer if the face of the complaint alleges a date or any attachment does.",
        "Although you could challenge the service of process by filing a motion to quash, it probably would not be worth your while to challenge the service (because the plaintiff can just re-serve you). Rather, you should focus on either settling the debt or responding to the summons and complaint. In the event you absolutely cannot afford an attorney to defend you, you can represent yourself \"in pro per\". You would file either an Answer or a General Denial, and pay the first appearance filing fee.\n\nThe form for the Answer is (Judicial Council Form PLD-C-010):\n\nhttp://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/pldc010.pdf\n\nThe form for the General Denial is (Judicial Council Form PLD-050):\n\nhttp://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/pld050.pdf\n\nThe filing fee depends upon the amount of the claim. If you cannot afford the first appearance filing fee, you may apply for a fee waiver. See:\n\nhttp://www.courts.ca.gov/selfhelp-lowcosthelp.htm#fees\n\nAn Answer to Complaint typically includes a general denial plus a number of affirmative defenses. The various affirmative defenses must be separately stated and must refer to the causes of action to which they relate in a manner by which they may be intelligently distinguished.” (Code Civ. Proc., § 431.30(g).) Typical affirmative defenses for a collection lawsuit include:\n\n1. The complaint fails to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.\n\n2. Plaintiff lacks standing to sue.\n\n3. Plaintiff failed to mitigate any purported damages he/she/it may have suffered.\n\n4. Plaintiff's claims, in whole or in part, are barred by the doctrine of laches.\n\n5. Plaintiff's claims are barred by the equitable principle of unclean hands by virtue of Plaintiff's conduct and actions.\n\n6. Plaintiff's claims are barred by the equitable principle of estoppel.\n\n7. Plaintiff’s claims are barred by the statute of limitations set forth under Code of Civil Procedure sections 337(1) and 339(1).\n\n8. If you are in bankruptcy or your debt has been discharged, they cannot pursue a claim against you.\n\n9. If the collection agency or credit card company has done anything to violate the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, you can raise that as an affirmative defense."

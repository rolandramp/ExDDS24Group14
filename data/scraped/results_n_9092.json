    "title": "Buying our first home but wife has unpaid debt, should I keep her name off the title or can a lein be placed by creditors anyway",
    "question": "She owes 5 credid cards totaling $60,000 from before we were married. They have been unpaid for about 6 years. 2 of them mailed us papers that they went to court, but she didn't have to pay anything since she had no money. Now a couple years later, I am trying to buy a cheap house, but I don't want a lein placed on the house. The debt should go away in about a year since it has been 6 years of no payment. Can a lein get placed by creditors if only my name is on the deed? We live in California, can the creditors place a lein on my name since we are married? Should I record the title as a title holding trust?",

        "If she has a judgment or two against her, that will most likely turn up during the escrow process and they will require you to pay off those judgments before putting her on the title. Sometimes, they also check the credit report and may require you to pay off those unpaid bad debts or prove they are otherwise unenforceable or settled. Because of the four year statute of limitations and your remark that it has been more than four years, the other debts are unenforceable, so I would not pay anything to settle them. My legal guide on negotiating debts after a lawsuit is in the link, below.\n\nBased on what you have in your posting, I would not put her on title, but I would see if you can resolve the two outstanding judgments before you buy the house, because these judgments can haunt her for up to 20 years from date of the judgment. If they learn she is married to a homeowner, they may do their best to get the judgment extended to include you. I have had success in setting aside invalid default judgments, so please view my Avvo profile if you'd like to contact me privately.",

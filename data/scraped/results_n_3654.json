    "title": "My wife's name is not on my default judgment, or in any of my court paperwork. Can the creditor levy her bank account too?",
    "question": "A default judgment was taken against me without me knowing I had been sued, and a collection agency is now trying to levy my bank account and garnish my wages. My wife was not sued with me and she isn't on any of the Court paperwork. Can they take her wages and her bank account too even if she wasn't on my credit card account, and wasn't on the Court papers?",
    "answers": [
        "In some circumstances they can levy a bank account against a spouse of a debtor in California.",
        "If you live in California, which is a community property state, there is a way for the creditor to amend the judgment and/or levy upon community assets (such as bank accounts) or garnish community earnings which are in your wife's name. The bigger issue is whether the judgment is valid. You need to find the Proof of Service which was filed with the court and then consult an attorney to find out whether it might be possible to set aside the default judgment and whether the collector agency might be required to pay your attorney's fees.",
        "If the judgment was only against you, the creditor can not collect from your wife. However, if you and your wife have joint accounts they can attempt to access monies in that joint account. They can not garnish her wages."

    "title": "Are all actions taken before entry of the Bankruptcy Court's order on relief from automatic stay, void?",
    "question": "A motion for relief was filed. The Bankruptcy Court granted the motion in its tentative ruling. However, the Bankruptcy Court did not sign and enter the order on the relief until a month later, which materially limited the scope of the relief. Before the order was entered by Bankruptcy Court, Creditor filed a motion in state court against debtor. Is Creditor's action void, by jumping the gun and not waiting for the Bankruptcy Judge to sign the order granting relief?",
    "answers": [
        "Technically, the relief does not beome effective (and the filing of the state court motion is not proper) until after the order is entered; but the bankruptcy court could provide in its order that the stay is \"annulled\" as it pertains to the action or otherwise validate the creditor's filing of the state court motion. Query also whether the court will look favorably on an argument that the motion filed post-ruling is void, particularly in the absence of legitimate prejudice to the Debtor.",
        "A couple of things that are missing. 1) What does the minute order say? 2) was the motion for relief opposed? Was a hearing conducted and did the debtor attend? 3) What type of motion was filed in state court? Was the RS Order issue disclosed to the judge in state court?\n\nAs the other attorneys have pointed out, you cannot get a meaningful answer to a question unless all the facts are know.",
        "Knowing a complete procedural history is of a particular importance here. On the one hand, all actions taken in violation of the automatic stay are void. On the other hand, however, you state that the \"Bankruptcy Court granted the motion in its tentative ruling.\" In the event the Court adopted its tentative ruling and granted the motion for relief from the automatic stay to enable the creditor to proceed with a state court action against the debtor, a signing of a stay relief order itself may be considered clerical in nature/ministerial act and thus creditor's actions may be considered not violative of the automatic stay. Moreover, in certain circumstances, the bankruptcy court has an authority to retroactively validate actions that otherwise would be voidable. Please consider consulting a local bankruptcy counsel if who should be able to assist you with this matter.",
        "You have provided insufficient information, i.e., what the limitation on the relief sought? Is your bankruptcy a chapter 7 or 13 or 11? Do you have an attorney representing you? If so - talk with your attorney. If not, seek a consultation with a bankruptcy attorney in your area to further discuss the details.",
        "What does your attorney say? This question is in the chapter 11 bankruptcy area. If you are in a chapter 11 with an experienced attorney, you will have significant problems. Get an attorney and discuss the ruling, order and motion to determine whether the motion is void or not. Much of that depends upon what the order said."

    "question": "My parents' development/construction business has had good times i.e.family vacations to europe, ridiculously expensive cars... They paid cash for half of my private undergraduate education and living expenses. When the market crashed, I got school loans. I figured that their 400 acre development project would be built. Instead, their partner allowed the project to go into foreclosure. In the midst of all this, I started law school and will begin my third year in the fall. Being the utter moron that I am, I managed to accrue $12K in credit card debt. I looked into enter a program. Either they tell you to default so they can negotiate your debt down or lower the rates. After transferring balances, my rate is equal to the negotiated rates. What do I have to do to get admitted to the bar?",
    "answers": [
        "Everyone is right that debt isn't an automatic bar to getting admitted to the bar. I'm not admitted to California, but I know of a few people who applied to the Illinois bar who had issues because of their debt load, but I think what happens is if they are concerned about your debt load, while you are applying to get admitted, they will inform you of this having any impact on your ability to get admitted. Your student loans shouldn't be an issue, as most new lawyers have substantial student loans (or lots do if not most), and $12k in credit card debt isn't even that high. I would think if you are acting responsibly with your debt you should be fine. If you are experiencing issues with the application process, I think it would be a good idea to find a local attorney that specializes in helping attorneys deal with character & fitness issues with the bar (among other related things). I can't imagine your situation is unique.",

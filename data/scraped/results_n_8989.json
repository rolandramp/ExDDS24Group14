        "Under California community property laws, you are entitled to 50% ownership of everything your husband earned during the marriage- unless otherwise agreed to in writing. If he already had ownership interest of the corporation (which it sounds like he did) when you got married, then the corporate shares would be considered his separate property. A corporation is designed to protect its owners from personal liability, so assuming the corporate formalities have been followed, and he transfers 40% ownership interest to you, you should not be personally liable for debts of the corporation, but liable only to the extent of your ownership interest. In other words, you may have to give up your interest if the company gets too heavily in debt, but your personal property should be safe.\n\nThe foregoing is not legal advise and should not be relied upon as such.

        "You should not assume that the business is community property. How long have you been married? How long has he owned the business? Whose funds were used to start the business? Did you work for the business? Was there a pre-nuptial agreement?

That means he owns it as his separate property, so you would have no ownership in the business. If the facts were reversed—20 years of marriage and two years of ownership and community funds were used to buy or start the business, then is pretty clear that the business, and its shares owned by him, are community property (CP), so you would own half of the business.

More likely a court would refuse to honor the transfer of shares except as follows: Generally a couple is not able to change the nature of ownership of marital property during the marriage unless a written Agreement is made and each party is represented by a different, independent lawyer at the time. So you need to consult your own counsel to determine whether the business is CP or SP, and to have her draft an Agreement between you and your husband stating exactly what property is to be transferred and whether the shares will be CP or SP after the gift.

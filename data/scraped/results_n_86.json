    "title": "How to remove illegitimate bankruptcy?",
    "question": "Recently applied for a mortgage and was shocked when they mentioned my BK from almost 10 years ago!! I received all the BK documents and my name and last four of social match! I do not recognize the address listed and apparently no one over showed up so it was dismissed/discharged. I called the attorney on the documents but have not heard back from him. How is this possible?? And most importantly how can I fix this?",

        "I have seen this scenario many times over the years. Debtors are perplexed to find they have a bankruptcy on their record. Upon investigation and asking the right questions it was determined that the cases were filed to stop a foreclosure of the debtor's residence. During the housing crisis there were a lot of unscrupulous people doing whatever it took to prevent foreclosures. Many homeowners signed documents while they were in desperation mode and didn't realize what they were signing. The big question: Is you signature on those documents? Consult with a bankruptcy attorney who can pull those documents from the court's website. All this being said, this is not to say that your case fits into this mold.",
        "It is a little odd that you don't state directly that you \"never filed bankruptcy.\" Did you file bankruptcy but not that one? Did you start the process but decide not to go through with it? Also, did they deny you the mortgage because of the bankruptcy (I doubt it if the bankruptcy was nearly ten years old)?\n\nDoes the bankruptcy case number on the credit report match the case number of the case you referenced and found?\n\nI don't think I would start the process with a dispute with the credit reporting agencies. The dispute will come back verified because the case is on file. I think the way to get the quickest result (but it will also be the most costly) is to hire a bankruptcy attorney in that district to file a motion to have the name and social amended or some other relevant relief. Once that happens, the issue might correct itself, but you will probably need to follow-up by sending disputes to all three credit reporting agencies.\n\nPlease do NOT contact me directly. If you wish to add information, please do so using the comments link below the answers.",
        "In over 35 years of handling bankruptcy cases I have only heard of this happening one time where the debtor claims someone else must have filed a false petition in his name. If it was not your petition, then you need to contact all 3 major credit bureaus and ask them to commence an investigation into this matter and correct the error. It is a bit ironic that after 10 years: a) this is the first time you learned the bankruptcy [you never applied for any credit in the past]; and b) if has been more than 10 years since the petition was filed, the case should not even be on your credit record after 10 years under the Fair Credit Reporting Act.",
        "Start with US trustee office. https://www.justice.gov/ust-regions-r15/region-15-southern-district-california\n\nand Bankruptcy court https://www.casb.uscourts.gov/",
        "If you do not get a phone call back from the lawyer who filed this bankruptcy, I suggest that you report this matter to the Office of the United States Trustee for the district in which the case was filed. There was some fake filing going on ten to twelve years ago by unscrupulous people who were trying to forestall real estate foreclosures.",
        "Never seen that question asked ever! I am assuming you meant YOU never filed bankruptcy. Thus, I am assuming correctly, then you might object to all 3 creditor reports which show you filed and follow the directions. HOWEVER, I am more inclined to pay an attorney in the location of the bankruptcy court of the FALSE filing to file a motion for a judge to order that the name and social security number be deemed amended to remove both for that reason that you did not file. It could be done in 30 days. I would do that forthwith. That is my advice. Local rules of that Court your attorney will be familiar with also to comply. Thanks for asking too. And enjoy the new house or refinance."

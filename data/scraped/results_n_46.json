    "question": "Suppose you have a $1,000 secured credit card with current balance in the amount of $350. How would you list that on family law (divorce) Form FL-160? Do you list it on item 23. under column \"D\" in the amount of $350, $1,000, or $1,350?",
    "answers": [
        "Your form requires you to list your debts and assets. The $350 you owe on the secured CC is a debt. The $1000 deposit to the CC is an asset. You might think you are saving money doing this pro se, but depending on your personal expertise in this area might be misplaced. At least set up a free consultation with a family law attorney in your area. Use the Avvo \"Find a Lawyer\" feature.",
        "You owe $1000 -$350. (You paid is $1000 in, used $350 of it.) you don’t owe $1000 + $350. The $1000 is an asset, the$350 is a debt. I’d say list the net, but explain. I’m nit aware of any convention on this issue.",
        "List the current balance on FL-160."

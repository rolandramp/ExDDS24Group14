    "title": "Can a creditor garnish my wages twice for the same account",
    "question": "My wages were garnished in 2005 and paid to a levy officer, now the creditor is trying to garnish my wages again for the same account can they do that?",

        "I agree with attorney Koslyn's answer and would add that you might want to look at the original court file and make sure the amount is right. Normally it's 10% interest plus fees and costs.\n\nMatthew Williamson",
        "I concur with Ms. Koslyn. The judgment creditor may continue enforcement action until the principal debt, accrued interest and collection costs are fully satisfied. Enforcement action may include repeated bank levies or wage garnishments. Many reasons exist for a wage garnishment not resulting in full satisfaction of the judgment debt, including the judgment debtor changing jobs to thwart the collection effort. California law permits a money judgment to be enforced for up to ten years and provides a procedure for renewing the judgment if necessary. You should consult with an attorney to discuss the particulars of your matter and for any specific legal advice.",
        "Yes, if the judgment wasn't satisfied by the 2005 garnishment, or if this is a new judgment.\n\nDisclaimer: Please note that this answer does not constitute legal advice, and should not be relied on, since each state has different laws, each situation is fact specific, and it is impossible to evaluate a legal problem without a comprehensive consultation and review of all the facts and documents at issue. This answer does not create an attorney-client relationship."

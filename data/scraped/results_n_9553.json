        "Once you file, your case is randomly assigned to one of a handful of Chapter 7 trustees in the city.\n\nWhen your trustee is assigned, you will be give a date for your 341 meeting of the creditors roughly 25-35 days after the date you file. This is the one time you need to show up and do something. You will be sworn in under oath and asked about your case by the trustee. Creditors can ask you questions under oath as well, but they rarely show. You will need to provide the trustee certain documents before the meeting, including the last tax return you filed, and the last 60 days of paystubs or profit and loss statement, if applicable. Some trustees require a brief questionnaire sent before the meeting as well - it would not hurt to call and ask in advance if your trustee requires this.\n\nAfter the meeting of creditors, hopefully you receive a report of no distribution of assets, meaning the trustee is not looking to take anything from you and liquidate it on behalf of creditors. After your meeting of creditors there is a 60 day waiting window where the trustee or creditors can object for various reasons. After that window closes, and there are no objections, your case is sent to the judge for an order discharging your case. In San Francisco, the judges usually sign off pretty quickly.\n\nIf everything goes smoothly, you should get an order discharging your debts in less than four months.\n\nThis information is not, nor is it intended to be, legal advice. This does not constitute the formation of an attorney-client relationship. You should consult an attorney for individual advice regarding the specifics of your situation.",

    "title": "I had a bankruptcy discharged in 2012. Liens on my home were placed by credit card debt collectors at that time. ?",
    "question": "The credit card debt was discharged by the bankruptcy. Why do the liens still exist to this day? Will there have to be a pay off to these debt collectors to remove the lien even if the debt was discharged in 2012. Some of these debt collectors do not exist any more. Will the bankruptcy have to be reopened even if it was discharged and closed? Can the liens be removed without reopening the bankruptcy?",

        "Sounds like some of your creditors sued you, got a judgment and recorded a lien against your real estate. Your BK lawyer should have taken care of this during the time your case was opened. If you didn't use a lawyer in your BK, this is what happens to debtors who don't have the benefit of good representation. If you thought you could do this yourself and save money, it will now be time to pay an attorney to take care of this. If you still intend on doing this yourself, it is a very unwise decision. Here are the steps necessary to fix this:\n\n1. File a proper motion to reopen your case;\n2. If your motion to reopen is granted, prepare a proper order for the judge to sign;\n3. File a motion to avoid the judgment lien(s), assuming you don't have any surplus equity beyond what you exempted;\n4. Serve the motion on all necessary parties; (special rules for service must be following including using certified mail to an officer of the creditor company;\n5. If no opposition is received, file a declaration of no opposition with the court;\n6. If your motion is granted, prepare a proper order for the judge's signature;\n7. Get a certified copy of the order from the clerk in the BK court;\n8. Record the certified copy of the order in the county where the original judgment lien was recorded.\n\nWithout any mistakes, this process usually takes about 60 days. If you make mistakes, the process will take a lot longer. Don't expect the judge to \"cut you any slack\" for mistakes. The judge will not act as your attorney and will hold you to the same standards as a bk lawyer. The BK judges actually don't like the extra time they must spend reading poorly drawn motions, detecting insufficient evidence, rejecting your paperwork for deficiencies, etc. This leads to the very likely outcome of dismissing your proceedings because the judge has too many other matters to resolve and won't take a lot of time fiddling around with pro se parties.",

        "Judgment liens on real estate survive bankruptcy even if the underlying debt is discharged. Note however that judgment liens fall off ten years from date of judgment unless renewed. You need to either re-open your case and file motions to avoid the liens or wait untll the ten years expires and hope the creditor doesn't renew the lien.",

    "title": "I am being sued by the national collegiate trust. I do not know what to do as I am unemployed. They are seeking 48k from me.",
    "question": "I was going to school and it shut down before I could graduate. I was making payments to aes. I stopped paying because the payments keep rising to where it became unaffordable for me to make payments. I stopped paying in 2013. They slapped me with a lawsuit a couple of months before the statute of limitations in CA. I was laid off my job in June and have not found employment yet. I am at my wit's end because I cannot afford an attorney and I have no money. I cannot find any free legal aid where I am located. I am frustrated and I do not know where to turn to. The loan dates back to 2006. How do I know that the paperwork is real? Where do I go from here? Am I able to file a bankruptcy?",
    "answers": [
        "Whether you can file bankruptcy and should are two different matters. And if you file, you can always try to be your own PRO SE attorney in a student loan adversary case. Never fun but you cannot obtain relief w/o trying! I just had 2 PRO SE clients both obtain settlements great for them. And one had defendant agree on morning of trial on 10-31-17 to discharge $68,000 in student loans! And the court is ruling on the other loans shortly from trial on the other defendants. Thus, it is hard to do and time consuming . But don't give up. Many great 9th Cir cases discharge student loans but no attorney on here can advise if you should or not as the facts required to know how to advise would take an hour of discussion with you..and that is talking very fast! Google them also.as they have been in some litigation too. Good luck.",
        "We defend these cases all the time, and on many (not all) we start our representation for as little as $500 up front (and on this we even allow payments) and thereafter $50/mo. This plus the court costs will get you thru a trial on the matter. There are many defenses to these cases and on occasion they get reduced to zero. On others, there is significant reductions of the amount along with long term (as much as 12 years) payment plans INTEREST FREE. The bankruptcy question is more difficult, but again, is possible depending on your circumstances. To get a bankruptcy discharge of a student loan, the cost can be significant. You do have options! Do not give up. Talk to someone who does these cases regularly. we have easily done over 100 of them by now, and have saved clients significant amounts.",
        "NCT has just a handful of attorneys nationwide that they hire to prosecute these types of lawsuits. You have some very good defenses that you can raise. The dance is that you have to engage them before they get too far into litigation. I suggest you contact a California attorney who specializes in both student loans and bankruptcy to weight all appropriate options.",
        "No being able to afford to pay is not a legal defense to a lawsuit. The way you know legal paperwork is real is by either going to the court virtual site or going to the courthouse in person. If your student loan was not guaranteed by the government, you will face some problems in the future dealing with this, but I don't know much of what you can do today. If this student loan was a public loan, there are attorneys who specialize in resolving these debts, some by having them eliminated in total because the school was closed, others that can refinance the debt by getting you into an income based repayment where your payments could be as low as $0/month. By waiting to seek legal help once you have been sued, the cost to resolve the problem will be higher than if you had acted back in 2013. If you sustained a serious disability, bankruptcy might help, but it is a complex and expensive process. Hope this perspective helps!",

        "Yes, you can file for relief under the bankruptcy code, but even private student loans are presumed to be nondischargeable. However, your attorney can file a complaint to determine the dischargeability of the student loan in an adversary proceeding (AP).

First the AP must be filed. Once the suit is filed, some courts use a test called the “totality of circumstances” in making the ruling on dischargeability. However, most of the bankruptcy courts around the country follow something called the “Brunner Test” to determine if a student loan can be discharged. The “Brunner Test” must be used in all of the Fifth Circuit states, which is where I practice. If your court follows the Brunner Test, then in layman’s terms you will be require to prove:\n\n1) That you cannot afford to pay the loan payments when your normal monthly income and living expenses are considered.\n\n2) That for the foreseeable future, your financial picture will continue to cause you to be unable to afford the payment for a significant portion of the student loan repayment period.\n\n3) That you have made a good faith effort to repay the loan or loans.\n\nFactors two and three are the issues we have proving so that my clients are entitled to discharge all or part of the student loans. First, the loan needs to be in payment status for a significant period of time and you need to be able to prove that you made payments when you could afford to pay them. I have seen cases in which the judge ruled that the debtor did not show a good faith effort to pay because the Debtor went by Starbucks every morning. The lenders and/or collection agencies will tell you that if you can’t pay the full payment, then do not send anything at all and the lenders’ attorneys will use the fact that you paid nothing against you.\n\nYou need to contact an experienced bankruptcy lawyer in your area that handles a significant amount of litigation in his/her bankruptcy case and ask him to review your situation with what must be proved to discharge a student loan.

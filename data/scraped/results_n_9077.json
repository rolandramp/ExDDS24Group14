        "W-2's, 1099's, and various tax documents often contain errors. In fact, it is common for some brokerage houses to amend their statements numerous times each year. It is the responsibility of the entity that issues these statements and forms to provide you with the correct form, and to amend them if there is an error. It is your responsibility to report the correct amount on your tax return. The form you receive is for information purposes. There is no financial responsibility that I know of to pay for you to correct your tax return due to an amended return. Unfortunately, that is your responsibility. In the future, I would check the W-2 you receive to make sure it is correct before you file your return. You can compare it to the checks you have received and also your final check stub for the year.

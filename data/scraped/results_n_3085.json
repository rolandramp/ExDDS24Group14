    "title": "Can I sue my bankruptcy attorney for misrepresentation/fraud?",
    "question": "I filed chapter 7 on Apr 2011 for $100k debt and was dismissed on Aug 2011 because my lawyer did not provide the document requested by the creditor. Refilled on Dec 2011 and was discharged on Mar 2012. 2 years later, I tried to refinance and found that the creditor I filed the chapter 7 for recorded a lien on Nov 2011 (in between the dismissal date and refilling date). My lawyer did not inform me about the motion to avoid lien until 2 years later when I found out that I have a lien on my house. I filed the motion to avoid lien on Apr 2014 and was denied because I've been paying for my mortgage without fail and the value of my house went up since 2011. Now I have $155k lien on my house. Is there anything I can do? Please help",

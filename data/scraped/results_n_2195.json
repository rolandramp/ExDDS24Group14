    "question": "I had my car repossessed in Riverside. The car is going to be sold sometime after April 9th. The car is currently being held at Anaheim. If I file for bankruptcy, will I have to pay the $300 to get the car out of repossession or can I put that cost in my bankruptcy?",

        "Our California colleagues would have a better handle on local practice. In my area, you file and make demand for return of the vehicle. As a courtesy, I provide proof of insurance showing the creditor as loss payee. For small operator creditors - to minimize fuss- I will provide for an administrative expense for the cost of repossession.",
        "If you file a Chapter 13 case, you would be required to file a turnover motion as an adversary proceeding to get the car returned to you. You should consult with a bankruptcy attorney, and see if you have the income available to successfully complete a Chapter 13 plan. If the court orders a turnover of the vehicle, the lender will probably not be able to collect those fees for impoundment of the vehicle.",
        "In my district you'd have to pay the repo and storage fees and show proof of insurance before they would be obliged to return the car. You might even have to file a motion for turnover, though that is somewhat unusual.",
        "You car was repossessed. I think your issues go deeper than $300 for the repo fee. You need to find a consumer bankruptcy attorney in your area right now. Chapter 13 allows you to get a car back even when it was repo'd, but the bigger question is what is going on that you cannot make your car payment and why you think can start to afford it if given the chance to reorganize your debt under Chapter 13. The $300 is the proverbial drop in the bucket.",
        "It depends on the value of the vehicle, the amount of equity, the amount you can exempt. Chances are you will have to pay the towing/repo/storage fees, but a more accurate response requires a face to face or telephone meeting with a BK lawyer. Click the Avvo tab \"Find a Lawyer\" . Many offer free consultations.",
        "This is typically up to the creditor. Sometimes the creditor will require the payment of the cost of repossession, however, that may be a technical violation of the automatic stay. The sooner you file the case, the more likely they return it without any further costs."

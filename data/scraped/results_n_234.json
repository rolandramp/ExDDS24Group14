        "The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure are mirrored in the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure. The US District Court can rely on all Federal Statutes contained in the Bankruptcy Code as well as the District Court Rules. What I think you are involved in is an Appeal to the District Court from a Bankruptcy Court Decision. You may want to consider hiring an attorney.",

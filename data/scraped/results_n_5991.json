    "title": "What is the best way to settle the past-due HOA fee after foreclosure?",
    "question": "The property was already foreclosed in 2010. The HOA had placed a lien against the property. I was told by the RE that the HOA lien would be wiped out after the bank foreclosed the property and I would not have to pay the past dues. Well, almost 2years later I got a letter from the collection company hired by HOA to pay $9000 (outrageously bloated amount!). I do not have $9000. I am devastated. My Q's are: 1) can HOA still do this to me after I lost my house? 2) will the collection company settle for a lesser amount? and what would be a good ballpark % that I should ask for? is 10% worth a try? 3) should I hire a negotiator/ lawyer? Any tips and advise are greatly appreciated.",

I too would recommend consultation with a bankruptcy or consumer rights attorney. It is likely such an attorney could negotiate a substantially better settlement than you would be able to on your own.",
        "Before I became a bankruptcy attorney, I represented HOAs as a collection attorney. An HOA can be quite stubborn about delinquent HOA dues. The law in California is that you are liable for all dues the accrue until the property transfers to some else.\n\nFor a $9000 debt, the HOA would probably want at least 50% if you to make a lump sum offer. They might also consider a payment plan.\n\nDebt settlement companies are nearly worthless, so I would consult a bankruptcy attorney about your BK and settlement options."

    "title": "Is there a time limit on collecting on a promissory note that has been extended year by year beyond the due date?",
    "question": "I am co-trustee of a trust estate. The other co-trustee owes the trust money in the form of an unsecured promissory note, interest only until called. The note was due in 2003. Terms of the note state that it can be extended year by year. He has never made a payment. My mother always let him continue and she always paid, and now her estate is paying tax on the imputed interest payments. Can it go on indefinitely? Can I call the note as one of my responsibilities as a trustee to collect debts? I may have misunderstood but someone mentioned a 4 -year time period to collect a note.",

        "My colleagues have provided you with sound information. At this point, your most prudent course of action would be to have the promissory note reviewed by counsel to determine if there is a statute of limitations issue. That matter aside, as trustees of the trust, you have a fiduciary duty to the trust beneficiaries, be sure that your action is not placing you in jeopardy for breach of that fiduciary duty.",
        "You should have the promissory note reviewed by an attorney to determine whether there are statute of limitation issues. Each of you as a trustee owes fiduciary duties to the trust beneficiaries. This situation should not be permitted to continue if your co-trustee/borrower has the ability to pay this obligation.",
        "Generally speaking, there is a 4 year limit on collecting for breach of contract (like failure to pay on a note), starting from the time of the breach. If the note has been properly extended, and the payee has waived payments, there is no breach. That being said, you are not required to continue extending the note, which will make it due and payable. If the other co-trustee then fails to pay the note, that will be the breach of contract and the 4 years will start to run."

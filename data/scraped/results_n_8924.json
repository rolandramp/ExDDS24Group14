        "It sounds like your uncle is going to quit claim deed the property over to you in exchange for $50K. Technically, there could be gift and estate tax implications to your uncle for the difference between his sale price and the fair market value of the house, but this would depend on MANY variables and may likely not even apply to him. He should consult with an estate planning attorney just to be sure. As far as you are concerned, you will be responsible for the property taxes once you own the house. The taxable base of the house will go up when the title exchanges hands, so you should be aware of that. Banks don't lend much these days, but you may be able to get an equity line of credit on the house.\n\nTHESE COMMENTS ARE NOT LEGAL ADVICE. They are provided for informational purposes only.

        "The amount of the fair market value over the amount you pay for the home would be considered a gift. Your uncle has an annual exclusion of $13,000 for gifts and under the split gifting rules $26,000 if he is married. For the amount of the gift over the annual exclusion your uncle can use his lifetime exclusion, if any. Your new basis in the house will be your uncle's basis (carryover basis) plus the $50,000 you paid. You would only be responsible for taxes when you sell the house for an amount over your basis. Your uncle would pay any gift taxes that may be due, but hopefully he has enough or all of his $1 million life time exclusion to exclude any gift taxes. If he owes gift taxes and does not pay them, you are secondarily liable to pay them.\n\nAny individual seeking legal advice for their own situation should retain their own legal counsel as this response provides information that is general in nature and not specific to any person's unique situation.

        "Agreed. Such a transaction would constitute a part sale/part gift. Your uncle should file a gift tax return (Form 709) to report the gift element. As indicated above, you would likely be liable for all real estate taxes and expenses associated with the house from the date of sale moving forward. As far as transfer taxes on the sale, since I don't practice in California I can't give you state specific advice. You should, as part of this transaction, consider hiring an estate planning attorney that also can service your real estate closing.\nWith regard to the loan: that would depend on factors such as your credit score, your other debts and assets, your income as well as the other factors.

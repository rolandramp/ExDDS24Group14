    "title": "What is the statute of limitations in California for a 2nd lender (HELOC) to go after a homeowner after foreclosure?",
    "question": "My home was foreclosed on over 4 yrs ago and I'd like to buy a new home. New lender says the HELOC lender I had on my home that was foreclosed on still shows a balance due on my credit report, even though it shows \"charged-off\". Last \"reported\" dated on credit report shows July 2014. Does that lender still have the right to collect? Can I ask them to update the record on my credit report to show zero balance, without the risk of having them start the collection process all over again? If they keep updating the \"reported\" date every month, when does the statute of limitations begin and end?",

        "The statute of limitations in regard to a collection lawsuit and the credit reporting issue are independent of one another. As mentioned, the SOL on a breach of contract claim is 4 years in California from the last payment (typically). However, it is lawful for a lender or collection agency to continue attempting collection of it even past the SOL. In some cases we have even seen lawsuits filed past the SOL (in those cases the SOL is raised as a defense).\nIn regard to credit reporting, a lender or collection agency can lawfully report an unpaid account for up to 10 years, notwithstanding the SOL discussed above. As was mentioned the term \"charged off\" is terminology the lender uses for their internal accounting and has no legal impact.\nAlthough I know it's not what you wanted to hear, I hope the excellent answers provided clear up any confusion. Your best bet at this point is to do a credit repair program or to attempt to settle the debt for a small amount in exchange for the lender agreeing to remove the tradeline from your credit. Each of these options can be very tricky and you must get a written contract from the lender agreeing the debt is settled completely and will be removed, but be careful not to restart the SOL. The downside of setting is the lender will likely 10-99 you for the amount left unpaid and written off.\nIf you'd like to discuss the matter in more detail, I'd be happy to do so at no charge.",
        "Was the HELOC in any way used to finance the property? If so, it may be considered a purchase money debt that may be ineligible for deficiency relief (meaning they might not be able to come after you).\n\nKeep in mind that even if the statute of limitations runs out, this does not stop a lawsuit from actually being filed. If you are served with a lawsuit, you will likely want to raise the statute of limitations as a defense in your response.",
        "The lender whose security interest got wiped out by the foreclosure still has the right to collect. A charge-off is the declaration by a creditor that an amount of debt is unlikely to be collected. This is an internal accounting designation designed to give the creditor a tax exemption on the debt. Often, these charged off \"bad debts\" are then sold to collection agencies. A charge-off does not free you, the debtor, of having to pay the debt. The debt remains legally valid, and the creditor still has the right to collect the full amount so long as it is within the statute of limitations period.\n\nThe statute of limitations for breach of written contract in California pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure section 337 is 4 years from breach or last payment, whichever is later. Promissory notes secured by real property can have a statute of limitations as long as 6 years, under certain circumstances, pursuant to California Commercial Code 3118 & 3304. Also, there are ways in which the statute of limitations might be extended (tolled)."

    "title": "My mortgage loan was not reaffirmed in a chapter 7. The mortgage co states discharged in bk. Can they foreclose if I don't pay?",
    "question": "I did not reaffirm my mortgage in a chapter 7 bk, discharged in 1/2014. The mortgage company lists it on my credit as discharged in bankruptcy. And when they discuss this loan with me they state they are not trying to collect on a debt that has been discharged. But I keep paying for it every month. If I stop paying for it, can they foreclose? Seems like they can't state it's been discharged and foreclose at the same time. If I stop paying can they foreclose?",
    "answers": [
        "First, you cannot transfer any interest in your home until the bankruptcy case is CLOSED or an Order of Abandonment entered on the home by you (not Discharged but CLOSED) so call and verify that. If closed, then it is now your property if you wish to dispose of it. It is great you did NOT reaffirm but they have an \"IN REM\" interest which is a secured debt in property vs an \"In PErsonam\" interest which was discharged. Thus, their only option W/O you is to foreclose. That then leads to your options:\n\nOption #1: Live there free as long as you can until you have to vacate. Even after a sale the question is how long are you able to remain there before having to leave. Each state has its own foreclosure laws so you would have to check with a bankruptcy attorney or real estate attorney in your state on that issue of how long can you stay there. Save your money and use to move into your next place.\n\nOption #2 See if the creditor will accept a Deed in Lieu of Foreclosure by Paying YOU money ($3000? Ask them ) in return for that Deed. Why would they? Because they would want the property in their name now so they can resell it quicker. Why would they not? Because there might be judgment liens or 2nd mortgages or warrants or other encumbrances on the property that a foreclosure will insure clean title in the creditor and not subject to any other liens.\n\nOption #3: you could try and see if the Creditor/Mortgage holder agrees to a short sale. Why not? There may be encumbrances like in #2 above. Why so? So they can receive the same money they would receive but faster than if they foreclose and sell it for the same price. What do you get? Nothing. Zilch! So why not live there for free or rent it out is my comment in such a case.\n\nOption #4: Just move out and let it sit until foreclosed. Someone might break in, etc..and yet your personal liability is still discharged.\n\nYou might want to keep some type of insurance on the property in case someone gets hurt and or your personal belongings if worth the insurance on them.\n\nIf you have any Homeowner Association Dues (HOA) then any due AFTER (not before the petition date but AFTER) until the property is not in your name you are liable for! If ever there was any discussion of a special assessment also post petition you would then want to NOT have title in your name when such assessments are passed by the HOA!\n\nEventually they will foreclose but until then it is your property.\n\nAfter your case is 45 days past discharge make sure you order your 3 credit reports and make sure all discharged type debts state \"zero owed, discharged in bankruptcy\". Not written off debt, etc..but zero owed and object to anything else that is untrue. Those reports should simply state facts. On your mortgage no payments were due after you filed so make sure it shows no late payments post petition either.\n\nI hope my answer and the other answers by other attorneys assist you. Good luck with your fresh start. Sincerely, Richard D. Granvold, Attorney at Law.",
        "A mortgage (or deed of trust in CA) is a secured debt. That means that you personally owe the debt and your property owes the debt. Your Chapter 7 discharged your personal liability on the debt, however the lien still exists on the property (unless it was avoided). In general liens ride through bankruptcy and continue to be enforceable after the bankruptcy is discharged. The creditor cannot collect the debt from you personally nor can they ask you to pay the debt, however if you want to keep the property (and save it from being foreclosed upon) you have to pay for it. If you stop paying on the loan the mortgage company can issue a notice of default and then a notice of trustee sale date and foreclose on the lien against the property, however they cannot collect anything from you directly due to the discharge. The short answer is YES if you stop paying they can foreclose on you.",
        "Yes they can. The only affect your bankruptcy had on your mortgage is that if, for some reason, the bank forecloses and receives less than what you owe, you are not responsible for the difference.",
        "Oh wouldn't that be a slick trick - file bankruptcy and get a free house! A mortgage is a debt that is tied to property. Sort of like you sign the note and the house itself is your co-signer. That's how liens work. No different than the car loan. Your bankruptcy only eliminated YOU as the person owing the debt, but the house still owes the money. You pay, you keep, you don't pay, and the co-signer gets taken away, crying at the thought of losing you as its owner. Hope this perspective helps!",
        "Yes, they can foreclose if the debt is not paid as the property is security for the loan. If the loan goes into default then they have every right to foreclose on their security interest. You also may notice that even though you are paying the mortgage they are most likely not reporting it on your credit.",
        "Yes, the mortgage holder/servicer can foreclose if you default on the loan. You only discharged your liability under the note, the lien created by the mortgage was not affected by the bankruptcy discharge. In reality, in California the creditor could not collect the deficiency after the foreclosure any way in most instances.",
        "This is a common question I get in my office. Most often its several years after a bankruptcy when a client is upset and tells me they \"didnt include the house in bankruptcy.\" I have all of my clients sign a memorandum which states...\"your house is include din the bankruptcy. Provided you maintain the payments and the equity is not more than the allowable amount you will be able to keep your house.\" Short version, yes you declared bankruptcy on your house, but this does not change the terms of the loan. This means the same payment is due on the same date and will pay down the same balance under the same terms. If you do not make the payments they have the right to foreclose on your property, HOWEVER they can not collect on any deficiency that is left after said foreclosure.",
        "Of course they can! If we could keep our house for free just by filing a chapter 7 bankruptcy, every homeowner would file a chapter 7 bankruptcy. There is a distinction between personal liability and the lien. If you stop paying, the mortgage company can't come after you personally-- garnish wages or levy accounts, but they can AND WILL foreclose if you stop making payments.",
        "This is something that your bankruptcy attorney should have discussed thoroughly with you as part of their representation of you in the bankruptcy case.\n\nThe mortgage creditor holds, ordinarily, a Deed of Trust against your property. That Deed is ownership that you granted to secure the debt. The bankruptcy court cannot eliminate the ownership rights to your property held by the mortgage creditor. Those rights exist after the bankruptcy is over.\n\nThe discharge that you received eliminates your personal obligation to pay the creditor, but it doesn't end their ownership of your property. That ownership is ahead of your ownership in the property. Even though you don't personally owe the money, if it is not paid, the mortgage company can take the property through foreclosure.\n\nIt's a little more complex than that, but if you need additional information about how Deeds of Trust are handled in bankruptcy, talk to the attorney that handled your case."

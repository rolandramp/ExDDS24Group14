    "question": "Bought an online Business Networking business 18 months ago. And Although I went into this in good faith. I was deceived by the bank who got the loan from the SBA as well as the sellers. For the past 18 months I have worked my tail off without collecting a dime in Salary and the business was barely making it. Now that we're in the coronavirus crisis...My business just stopped. I desperately need someone who has experience negotiating with banks and the SBA to negotiate my loan down. I don't want to have to close my business...however what the business makes does not cover the payment and the bills.",

        "As a general matter, it is hard to negotiate down a loan with a fixed amount when there is legitimate paperwork with a bank outlining the terms of the loan. The bank more often than not did not commit fraud and is entitled to have the money repaid without a discount. Sometimes a bank takes a discount when it will get a lump sum payment. That being said, you might have a misrepresentation claim against the sellers that you should retain an attorney to evaluate. An attorney cannot contact you in response to this post. You must go on the Avvo \"Find a Lawyer\" tab and reach out to an attorney in your area for a free consultation Goodluck to you."

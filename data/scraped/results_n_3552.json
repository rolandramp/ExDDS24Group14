        "Your question cannot be answered without reference to facts. There is no \"one size fits all\" answer with respect to the statute of limitations on any particular debt obligation and particularly so with respect to a note secured by a deed of trust.\n\nYou need to consult counsel who can explore the facts with you to determine if you remain personally liable for the obligation and, if so, to what extent.\n\nIf you still own the property, and the holder of the HELOC has not foreclosed, the statute of limitations may be as long as 60 years. Good luck.",
        "The bank has a property interest in your home as a Heloc includes a deed of trust. The debt will continue to grow the longer you do not pay. You must deal with this issue ASAP.\n\nIf you have cash-a large discount settlement is typically an option. Some attorneys will handle such matters on contingency. I've seen debts settled for 10%. Income tax implications must be explored. Chapter 13 lien stripping should also be explored.\n\nDon't delay-figure out your legal game plan. Hire an experienced attorney/broker.",
        "The statute of limitations for filing a lawsuit against you is four years from the date of the breach. When you received the HELOC, a lien was placed on your property. There is no statute of limitations as to the lender's ability to foreclosure on the property."

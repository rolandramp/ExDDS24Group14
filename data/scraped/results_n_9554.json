        "It is unclear if you are asking if the tenant filed bankruptcy before or after he or she is already a tenant, or if he or she is a potential tenant that you are considering.\n\nAssuming the tenant has not filed bankruptcy yet and is an existing tenant: If the tenant is in an existing lease, the tenant can elect to assume and continue the terms of the lease, or he or she may reject the lease and stop paying (but must vacate). If the rent always was, or is now month-to-month, the tenant cannot stop paying rent and stay in the residence for free. But the tenant may continue to pay on a month-to-month basis. Thus if the tenant rejected the lease or stopped paying, the tenant must vacate under landlord-tenant laws. If the tenant continues to pay the rent as required, he or she may do so.\n\nIf the tenant has already filed bankruptcy, and you are asking whether it is safe bet to rent to him or her, it depends on a variety of factors, including past behavior as a tenant with other landlords, current income and the usual assessments for vetting a tenant.\n\nMy experience with consumers filing bankruptcy in the city is that most want to discharge their medical bills, credit card debt or whatever else is burdening them, and get on the right path, which for them, includes paying the rent.\n\nIf you could provide more facts, it may permit a better response.\n\nThis information is not, nor is it intended to be, legal advice.

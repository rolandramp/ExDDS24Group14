    "title": "How do I remove my soon to be Ex wife from the deed to the house if we are in bankruptcy and can't refinance?",
    "question": "I will be keeping the house in my legal separation and want to remove my wifes name from the deed. We filed CH 13 bankruptcy 3 years ago and have to make payments on that for the next 2 years. So, I can't refinance the house to have her removed from the loan. Can I still have her removed from the deed?",
    "answers": [
        "If your soon to be ex-wife is in agreement and she is willing to relinquish her rights to the property, she can execute a Quit Claim Deed. Doing so will her interest in the property. It is possible to refinance real property while in a pending Chapter 13 case. First, you must find a lender willing to fund the loan. Second, you must obtain an \"Order for Permission to Refinance Real Property\" from the bankruptcy court. If you are represented by an attorney, they will file a Motion with the Bankruptcy court requesting permission. If you are unable to obtain financing and only record the Quit Claim, your ex-wife will remain on the mortgage loan. Be aware, that if your Chapter 13 case is dismissed in the future, and your ex-wife subsequently files a \"Chapter 7\" straight bankruptcy, she will be required to disclose the transfer. The chapter 7 Trustee will scrutinize the circumstances surrounding the transfer. Consult with an attorney.",
        "You cannot unilaterally remove your spouse's name from the title. She can sign what is called a Quit Claim (not Quick Claim, as some mispronounce it!) giving up her interest to you, but her name will remain on the mortgage until such time, if any, as you refinance. If your ex won't voluntarily sign, a properly prepared order from the divorce court can be recorded to accomplish the same thing, but is a pain to put together. Hope this perspective helps!",
        "You need to have her as part of the marriage settlement agreement to execute an interspousal transfer deed to remove her from title and give you 100% ownership. As counsel below indicates you may have bankruptcy issues. You should definitely seek approval from your bankruptcy attorney on this before proceeding. Your attorney should also call your trustee to find out his or her position on this. The transfer is the easy part, it's the ramifications in the bankruptcy that you need to be careful about.",
        "You need to get the bankruptcy court to approve the transfer of her interest via a quit claim deed. The debt will not be transferred. Since you cannot refinance, you may be able to convince the creditor to release her while you assume the debt. Keeping up the payments in good faith could help your case. This will have to be reflected in your payment plan.",
        "The deed that placed the property in your and your wife's name will always be in the land records. You cannot take her name off of that deed, but she can sign a quitclaim deed transferring her interest to you. However, if she is a debtor, under ยง 363 of the bankruptcy code, a motion to authorize her to transfer her interest to you must be filed with the bankruptcy court before she can do that.\n\nYou need to contact your bankruptcy attorney, so he/she can proceed with whatever needs to be done. If you and your wife are going to deconsolidate your chapter 13 so she can convert to a 7 and you stay in a chapter 13 or any other action that each of you will go in different directions, your attorney may be required to withdraw or at a minimum, obtain a waiver of any conflicts from each of you. Lots to discuss with your attorney and both you should be there at the time that is done so that all three of you are on the same page.\n\nif you do not have an attorney, you need one now.

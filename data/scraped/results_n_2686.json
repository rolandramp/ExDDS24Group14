    "title": "I keep getting notices for not paying a toll when I'm not responsible. How do I get the letters to stop?",
    "question": "I get notices in the mail weekly for crossing the Golden Gate Bridge without paying. I drive a Ford F-350 as stated on the notice. The picture clearly shows a Fiat. I have also never been to the Bay area. The lunchbox on wheels has a big license plate border cutting off the bottom of an E to look like an F, meaning it looks like my number. I have called them about this and they say they will investigate for a year now. I sent them a letter explaining Fordâ‰ Fiat with a copy of Vehicle Code section 5201.1. The notices are still coming! I think they will only understand and respond to force rather than reason, civility, and common sense. How can I get an injunction against Fastrak?",

        "Hire counsel to send cease and desist letter.",
        "A cease and desist letter should stop the collection of the debt. If you send the letter yourself, versus having an attorney send it for you, send it certified mail. Once you receive the returned slip stating the letter was received the collection of the debt must stop. If you receive any letters or phone calls after this you should seek out a consumer rights attorney who would be able to file a lawsuit for violation of the cease and desist letter.",
        "I agree with my colleague that a strongly worded letter from an attorney would probably do the trick. Leaving a proper paper trail detailing your efforts to get the matter corrected would come in handy in the event the bureaucrats ever attempt court assistance in collecting. All correspondence with them should be in writing and sent by certified mail. Good luck to you. That said, this is not a BK question and I'm moving it to debt collection.",
        "I would suggest that you consult an attorney in your area to get your specific questions answered. Good luck!"

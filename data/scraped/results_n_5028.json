    "title": "My father is being charged by Mastercard Sears Solution, however he has never owned that card nor any credit card in his life",
    "question": "My father never owned a credit card, a collection agency was calling my roommate from Korea who I never met before in my life prior to this year and was trying to get into contact with me, recently my father received a bill from the company claiming he had a cash advance on that said non-existing credit card during December 2012 and that the payment is over due.I do not know what to do because we worry that his identity was compromised and if we say anything about his personal information it may worsen our situation.",
    "answers": [
        "I agree with my colleagues here. If the collector keeps contacting your father after they have been told that he does not owe the debt, he should contact a consumer attorney for possible violations of the FDCPA.",
        "In addition to what the two other attorneys have said, your dad needs to write the agency asking them to verify the debt. Tell the agency this is not his debt and ask for a copy of the card application and/or charges showing his signature. That will stop them for a while. Be sure to send the letter certified mail with a return receipt. Then they can't claim they never got it. It will also be good evidence in case you have to sue them for wrongful collection. Good luck!",
        "Sounds like he could be the victim of identity theft. A police report needs to be made. Contact the law enforcement agency that serves your jurisdiction. If that is the case then you must notify the credit reporting agencies as well. He should review his credit report to see if there are any other accounts that have been opened in his name.",
        "Request verification of the debt ... in writing."

    "question": "I caught my fiancé cheating two months into our engagement. I have called it off and now he wants the ring back which I feel I shouldn't since he's the reason we are no longer getting married plus he gave it to me on Valentine's. He threatened to sue me for it.",

        "Keep the ring.\nIf he sues, argue it was a gift.",
        "Yes you have to give back the ring. There is a specific statue that deals with wedding rings when a marriage is called off. A small claims court judge will be familiar with the statute. No reason to have a permanent public record of you being a defendant along with you getting a court order to have to pay for his costs as well when you lose.",
        "See California Civil Code Section 1590. If he sues, he’ll likely win. That said, the ring is worth less than he owes, so, it’s not necessarily worth it to file."

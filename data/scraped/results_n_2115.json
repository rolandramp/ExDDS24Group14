    "title": "Can current unemployment benefits that are offset by overpayments in past claim be discharged in a chapter 7 bankruptcy?",
    "question": "I received unemployment 2 years ago until I found my last job. I was laid off two months ago and am \"receiving\" unemployment benefits. The problem is that I was told I was overpaid when I received my benefits 2 yrs ago so now they are taking the entire amount of my \"payment\" to pay back that overpayment. I have not found a job and am behind on my bills and need to do something about my bills. I talked with 2 lawyers but both gave me different answers. One said overpayment will be discharged (or dismissed?) because its from a different claim and as soon as I file the bankruptcy I will start getting my payment. The other lawyer said that they can continue to offset that overpayment so even if I file they will still take from my \"payment\" so I receive nothing. Which one is it?",

        "As to your question about the discharge of the claim based upon an overpayment of benefits, if the state does not object to discharge then the overpayment will be discharged in your bankruptcy case. Some debts such as most taxes, most student loans, child support and alimony will not be discharged and the creditor is not required to object to the discharged.\n\nThere are some debts that are discharged if there is no objection. However, if the creditor objects and proves that certain conditions are met, then the debt is not discharged. An overpayment of benefits is one of those types of debts.\n\nIf the overpayment was caused because you found another job and you did not report the new income, in our jurisdiction if the state objects and proves that fact is true, then the debt will not be discharged.",
        "There is a law regarding setoff 11 USC 553 which I have attatched. The idea is that a creditor can deduct amounts owed from monies due you after a bankruptcy if allowed under non bankruptcy state law. I have seen various outcomes on this issue. One would have to be familiar with how unemploymentt is treated by your local authority to see what position they will take. Opinions may very regardiing this issue.",
        "If the claim is not for taxes, penalties, or a fine owed to a governmental unit, it should be dischargeable in a Chapter 7 case. I have represented many debtors who have discharged governmental claims for overpayment in the past in Chapter 7 cases. These were overpayment claims from state and federal agencies. Go see a bankruptcy attorney, and get your case filed. You can make many of their garnishment arguments moot by finding a job, and earning an income, so you will not be dependent on unemployment benefits. The debt owed to the agency can be discharged in a Chapter 7 case. Go see an attorney ASAP.",

        "Yes C& BK will eliminate the obligation for unemployment overpayments.\nNo. Creditor will not have right to offset after C7 BK filed.\nI have represented several clients who have successfully discharged unemployment overpayments in California.\nYour matter is precisely addressed in BK code 11 USC 523. link follows: :https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/11/523",
        "I also have been able to successfully discharge an overpayment claim for a client in Chapter 7. But as others have indicated, it could all depend on if the state wants to put up a fight and how overpayment claims are handled in your locality. It appears the overpayment claim is not automatically non-dischargeable under 11 USC 523. This means the state might have to file an objection or other motions to block the discharge of the claim. Such filings might be too much of a hassle, and the state may just let it go."

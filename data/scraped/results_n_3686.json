        "Are there other assets or debts to be divided? Suggest that the two of you agree to sell the house and then place the funds, after sale and close of escrow into a blocked account until after division of all assets and debts/liabilities. Also suggest you seek legal assistance so that all credits/reimbursements can probably be accounted for.",

    "title": "What exactly does § 707(b)(7)(B) Bankruptcy code point to?",
    "question": "Does it loosen up the separate household declaration for those that are married filing separately with a judgment of legal separation. Married, not filing jointly, with declaration of separate households. By checking this box, debtor declares under penalty of perjury: “My spouse and I are legally separated under applicable non-bankruptcy law or my spouse and I are living apart other than for the purpose of evading the requirements of § 707(b)(2)(A) of the Bankruptcy Code.” I asked something like this earlier but did not have a reference. Does the reference not apply?",
    "answers": [
        "Yes. If a judgment of legal separation has been entered, you can check that box whether or not you and your spouse are living apart from one another. On entry of a judgment of legal separation, your spouse's income is her separate property and her income is not required to be considered in determining whether or not you can file for a chapter 7 bankruptcy under the means test.",
        "Does it make a difference in the means test depending upon how you characterize your status? If not, then just complete the means test. If it does, then consider filing separate cases, assuming you would separately qualify for individiual chapter 7 cases. In any event, if none of the statements apply, you cannot check the box.",
        "You wrote, \"Does it loosen up the separate household declaration for those that are married filing separately with a judgment of legal separation?\"\nA: Yes.\nA judgment of separation is, IMHO, conclusive that 707.b.7.B does apply"

    "title": "Can the BK Trustee prevent me from voluntarily dismissing my chapter 7 case shortly after the 341 meeting but before a discharge",
    "question": "I went for 341 meeting, at the hearing the trustee treated me roughly and reschedule for another time while he wants to check which of my assets he can get his hands on, Can I voluntarily dismiss my chapter 7 case at this point? OR can I wait for the next meeting and see what happens? Can he prevent me from dismissing after the next hearing? At what point is a debtor no longer able to dismiss his/her case.",
    "answers": [
        "Colleague answers are very helpful. Trustee has broad discretion to re-schedule or continue the creditor's meeting for good cause. Generally, unlike a C13 case, you do not have a right to dismiss a C7 bankruptcy case. There are exceptions. Ultimately it is a decision the judge may decide. The C7 trustee does have standing to object to a voluntary dismissal. You may have a right to convert to C13. you should immediately consult you BK attorney on this.",
        "It's usually very difficult to dismiss a Chapter 7 case, especially when the Trustee thinks there may be assets they could find - whereas a Chapter 13 Debtor can request a voluntary dismissal of their case at virtually any time. Your best bet is to hire an attorney and keep an open line of communication with the Trustee or his/her attorney; you will need them on your side whether you decide to convert to a Chapter 13 (as they can always oppose it), file a motion to dismiss, or wish to settle any adversary proceeding with the Trustee. Courts usually give the Trustee great deference and therefore you want to make sure they are on the same page as you are with any planned motions or strategic moves. I like to send drafts of motions I plan to file to the Trustee or his/her attorney to gain their approval before filing. Good luck.",
        "At this point, you could try to file a motion to dismiss or convert your case to a chapter 13 to try and save any assets you may have. Unfortunately it's not an easy task especially if there are assets and yes the trustee could oppose any motions you may file. You should consult with a bankruptcy attorney asap to go over the details of your case.",
        "The bankruptcy trustee does not make the decision whether you can dismiss your Chapter 7 case, but the bankruptcy judge does have the right to make that decision. It is very unusual for a judge to agree to allow you to dismiss your Chapter 7 case because the standard you must meet is to show that YOUR CREDITORS would be better off with your case dismissed. If the Trustee finds assets, it is usually the case that CREDITORS are better off getting a piece of the pie. Hope this perspective helps!",
        "If there's an asset to be sold, the trustee can keep the case open. You may want to convert to Chapter 13 in that event. If there's no asset, the trustee has no interest in opposing your motion to dismiss, but it has to be a motion and usually an extra notice of a hearing. You can always try calling the trustee or going to the next meeting to find out what the asset is, and see if you can exempt it or what your defense is to them selling it. But you don't have an absolute right to dismiss the case.",
        "Absolutely. If you failed to report assets or he thinks they are worth more than you reported, he can come after those assets force sale those items to pay your debts. If you do not have an attorney already I highly suggest you get one. My office is available to help you. Typically, with attorney intervention, you can negotiate a settlement with the Trustee that will allow you to keep your assets and pay some money over time, or convert to a Chapter 13 bankruptcy if you qualify. Alternatively I can help you file a motion allowing you to dismiss if you misguided by someone to file the wrong type of bankruptcy or filed for the wrong reasons. Give my office a call ASAP.\n\nR.

        "It is important that you consult with a bankruptcy attorney in your area. You may be able to convert your case to a chapter 13 and save your assets.",
        "In a chapter 7, you would need to file a motion to dismiss your case. The chapter 7 Trustee can oppose it. The issue would be if it is in the best interest of the creditors to dismiss the case. Generally, if there are or are likely to be assets, the best interest of the creditors is to leave the case open and let the Trustee collect the assets.\nAlthough it may be too late, you should discuss this with a competent bankruptcy attorney in your area who may be able to help you convince the trustee to dismiss the case.

        "You are free to file a motion to dismiss the case. However, since there are assets at issue, it is likely that the trustee will oppose your motion. Unlike a Chapter 13 filing, you do not have the right to dismiss in a Chapter 7. If there are unexempt assets, the trustee may decide to sell those assets to repay your creditors, subject to court approval. You need to speak with a bankruptcy attorney as soon as possible.",
        "Yes, the trustee can prevent you from dismissing your case. The point at which you are no longer able to dismiss a Chapter 7 is when you file it, if the trustee wants to oppose the dismissal. Sounds like you really need to talk to an attorney as soon as possible."

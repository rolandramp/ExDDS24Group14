    "question": "I've received a summons thru an agency that bought out my old credit acct. They are suing me. I've reached out to that agency to make agreed pymnts to pay it off. They've received several pymnts from me, but I've missed the last pymnt to finish the agreement. At that tym, I've lost my job. Now, several years passed. They are suing me for the full amount that I owe.",

        "Its not clear from this question what happened in your case. If you contacted the debt buyer's attorneys immediately after getting \"served\" with a summons, the law firm may have asked you to sign a \"stipulation for entry of judgment.\" That is a type of settlement that specifies how much the defendant will pay, on what timetable, and what happens if the defendant defaults (fails to make all the payments on time).\n\nIf that happened, read the stipulation carefully. It may state one figure for total payments made voluntarily, but a different figure that would be due in the case of a default. The latter figure may be larger, as it may reflect the entire debt amount plus interest, costs and attorneys fees. If you signed it, and defaulted, the creditor can seek a court judgment for the \"default\" amount, less any payments that you have made.\n\nLook for an attorney in your area that handles consumer debt defense. Many provide free consultations by phone.",
        "I agree with colleagues and add:\nYes. You need an attorney.\nIf you cannot afford atorney and cannot do necessary research that is too bad.",
        "I agree you need to talk to a lawyer in your area. Find/consult/hire a lawyer using the Avvo feature \"Find a Lawyer\". Make a list of 4-5 having many 5 star reviews from satisfied clients. If you don't get a prompt call back from one, go on to the next on your list. Some offer a free consultation by phone or in person. Take us up on it. That said, you may have a good defense of Statute of Limitations. If more than 4 years have passed since you made a payment on the debt, the lawsuit may fail. If you have been served, look at the dates alleged in the complaint.",
        "I loved your question from Social Security to the Bankruptcy and Debt section.\n\nI do recommend you talk to a bankruptcy lawyer, most of whom offer free consultations. You may also consider talking to a civil defense attorney if you have recently been served with a civil complaint because you have limited time to respond."

    "title": "Determining if SOL has ran out.",
    "question": "I was sued for approximately 30,000.00 due to a student loan. I made my last payment 4/2011, and default happened 5/2011, with no payment arrangements agreed to after that date. So the SOL started from that point. I was sued 11/2014, and the attorney subsequently dismissed the lawsuit without prejudice 05/2016.",
    "answers": [
        "I agree with my colleagues. In addition, if it is a private student loan and you are in a state (pursuant to choice of law clause in your loan agreement - you want to read this carefully or take it to an attorney) that time bars the creditor from bringing the claim, but the creditor still fills the claim you will likely want to answer the complaint and bring the SOL as an affirmative defense. Keep in mind, responsive papers and SOL statutes can be complex...I highly recommend you speak with a \"debt collection\" or \"student loan\" or \"bankruptcy\" attorney.",
        "In this situation, the statute of limitations begins to run when the default occurs, When a payment is due but is not made, that is a default. You indicate that the default occurred in May, 2011. Assuming that Code of Civil Procedure 337 applies, the lender has 4 years to file the lawsuit. However it is possible that your loan contract contained a \"choice of law\" provision that would make another state's statute of limitations apply. Read your loan documents thoroughly, or have an attorney review them.\n\nThe statute of limitations is no longer an issue when a lender files a lawsuit, because filing the lawsuit before the statutory period runs satisfies the statute. However the filing of the lawsuit doesn't \"toll\" the statute in the event that the lender dismisses the case and wants to re-file it. A subsequent lawsuit has to be filed within the statutory period, whatever that may be.\n\nIf the creditor does not re-file the case within the statutory period, the debt is \"time-barred\" -- in that case the creditor is not likely to file another lawsuit. But, without a motion or court trial to establish that the debt is time-barred, the borrower still owes that debt, and it may appear on credit reports for 7 years.",
        "Sure would have helped to address your questions if you had mentioned whether your student loans are public or private, because public student loans are not affected by the SOL. Think of the SOL as a timer - time stopped on the timer when the lawsuit was filed, and resumes now that the suit is dismissed. You do not get to count the time the suit was active in measuring the time under the SOL. Hope this perspective helps!"

        "The other response gave you excellent advice about your personal liability for this lease. Current economic conditions make a commitment like this especially risky, so you should make sure you understand every aspect of this business and every term in this lease before you sign anything.\n\nDisclaimer: Please note that this answer does not constitute legal advice, and should not be relied on, since each state has different laws, each situation is fact specific, and it is impossible to evaluate a legal problem without a comprehensive consultation and review of all the facts and documents at issue. This answer does not create an attorney-client relationship.",
        "If you sign as an individual, that is a personal guarantee. It does not need to specify that you're personally responsible. Also, if your business is just a DBA and you operate as a sole proprietorship, you are still personally liable for the debts of your business.\n\nMost commercial landlords will not rent to a small business without a personal guarantee since the businesses themselves do not have much in the way of assets. Your lease is likely to be your greatest liability; with a ten-year lease, you should consider having an attorney or real estate professional familiar with retail leases review it so you understand the provisions that will bind you for the next 10 years."

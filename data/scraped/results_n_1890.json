    "title": "I actually gave my debt collector my social security number. What do I do? What can they do?",
    "question": "I called to settle an ongoing debt with Portfolio Recovery Associates. I was absentminded enough to give them my social security number when asked. I obviously wasn't thinking clearly. The debt is around 7-8 years old for $2095. What action will they take against me and is there anything I can do to prevent them from coming after me?",

        "Even though this is a debt collection agency, they are subject to several state and federal privacy laws that protect the consumer from illegal use of your private information, such as SSN or DOB. Best thing to do is not get stressed over it. Does this company have a judgment against you? If not, then I would simply ignore this and if they threaten to sue you and you have not paid it in over four years, then I would not pay it. If you were sued or about to be sued, then consult with a debt collection DEFENSE attorney, do you don't waive your rights and end up with a big money judgment against you.",
        "Do they have a judgment against you? If there's no judgment yet, have they sued you? They usually want the social security number to aid in their enforcement of a current or future judgment, if any. Specifically, an ssn is helpful if they attempt to levy bank accounts or garnish your wages. If you have settled the debt, however, it is likely you do not need to worry about these possibilities.",
        "You need debt settlement. You may decide to file bankruptcy."

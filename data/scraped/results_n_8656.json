    "question": "I am going through divorce in LA county in California. My wife is living in family residence since separation (more than a year) and I am renting. She is paying for mortgage for more than a year. The house is upside down and neither one of us can refinance the other one out. Can court award her the house because she is currently living in it and also has primary custody of our child knowing that bank will not remove me from the loan until there is at least 20% equity? In other words, can court force me to stay on mortgage loan until house builds equity for refinance, but award the ownership to her? If not, what will be court's decision in this case??",

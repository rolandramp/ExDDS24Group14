    "question": "My Chapter 13 Plan was filed on 8/27/2013. My Plan was Confirmed on November 22, 2013. My unsecured creditors are to receive 2% I filed my 2013 Income Taxes and now owe $4,000 to federal and $889 to State. Can I modify the plan to pay these new debts?",

    "answers": [
        "Modifying to pay post-petition taxes will not afford you the advantage of no-penalty/no-future interest that you get for putting pre-petition taxes in the (confirmed) plan. IRS will still charge interest and penalties on the new liability, but you will be paying the Trustee rather than IRS directly. And the trustee is undoubtedly the better bookkeeper. Can you afford to pay an additional $4889 in the time you have remaining for your plan? You don't want to jeopardize what you already have.",
        "You won't be able to modify the plan to pay the post-petition tax debts \"through\" the plan. However, you may be able to modify the plan and add the necessary monthly tax payment to pay the tax debts as an expense (schedule J) and reduce payments to the chapter 13 trustee. Whether you can do so depends on what is in your plan now.",
        "You certainly can do this, but what was the reason you now owe taxes? If under withholding, what is going to happen next year, and the years after that? Hope this perspective helps!",
        "This is a bit tricky. You can certainly modify the plan to provide for payment of the post-filing tax liability per Section 1305 of the Bankruptcy code. However, the IRS and Franchise Tax Board do not have to file a proof of claim, and if they don't file a proof of claim, the taxes won't get paid and the money will end up going to your other creditors. You can certainly call their respective insolvency departments ahead of time and ask if they would be willing to file a proof of claim for payment. If they say no, then the other option would be to modify your Chapter 13 Plan payment amount to make room in your budget for the purpose of paying the taxes outside the plan. Best to get an attorney to help you with this.",
        "I don't know how much a month you are paying or other elements of the plan that are required like some taxes, child support,etc. But an unexpected change is grounds for filing an amended plan. Your new tax debt is an expense you can add to your budget if NOT already part of the prior budget. The law requires a new amended Schedule I and J to be filed and the trustee will want to see proof of recent income and a copy of that tax return. The sooner you act the better. Why? The second an amended plan is filed that change in plan payment IS THE NEW PAYMENT even though the hearing has not been held! Thus, discuss with an attorney and get that done asap. Good luck."

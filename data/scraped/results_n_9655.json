        "California Domestic Partnership is restricted to same-sex couples, and heterosexual couples where at least one person is over age 62. If one of you is over 62 and you are interested in investigating a domestic partnership, you should know that domestic partners are exposed to liability for each other's debts in certain circumstances. This is a complicated area of law; you should consult an attorney about the particular facts of your case before proceeding."

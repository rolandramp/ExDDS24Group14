        "I'd recommend you start with the bankruptcy lawyer who helped you with your Chapter 7 filing. If you elected to reaffirm the mortgage debt, keep the house and catch up on or continue making the payments and have defaulted on that election, you're still liable for the debt and any expenses allowed by your agreement with the lender. If you elected to surrender the house, it's unlikely you will be required to pay the lender's expenses incurred in reclaiming the property.",
        "Hard to tell from your description. In all likelihood all they are entitled to is to enforce their security interest but you should meet with your bankruptcy attorney right away.",
        "You should take those papers to a lawyer immediately for review and advice. From this distance, we have no idea what kind of personal jeopardy this legal action might put you into."

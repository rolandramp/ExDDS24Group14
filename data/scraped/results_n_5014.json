    "title": "Can a creditor force me into bankruptcy",
    "question": "I let an unsecured credit card debt go to judgement against me. The original debt was like 35K but at judgement they set it at 72K , they filed a lien against my property, but now they are attempting to subpoena me for financial info. I work out of state alot and have not been handed a subpoena personally .",
    "answers": [
        "Involuntary bankruptcy is not common and that is not what they are attempting here. What they want is your financial information: where you bank, where you work, etc so they can go after other assets through things like wage garnishments, bank levy. Most bankruptcy filings are voluntary, meaning the debtor files to protect assets and get a fresh start.",
        "You don't have to leave America for reasons of an unpaid judgment. Your subpoena is for a debtor's examination whereby a creditor can obtain a court order for you to appear and answer financially related questions and produce financially related documents. In order for this to be done, you must be personally served with the paperwork by a sheriff or specially appointed person pre-approved by the court. If you are personally served and do not comply with the court order, you can be found in contempt of court and a bench warrant issued for your arrest. You can trump all of this by filing a BK using an experienced BK atty. Good luck.",
        "In short, yes, the creditor can, in certain circumstances, force you into an involuntary bankruptcy. The process is not simple, however, so unless you have additional large judgments against you, I would not worry too much about that happening. You should consult with an attorney to discuss this matter because it can be complex.\n\nIn America, people rarely, if ever, go to jail for non-payments of their debts. There is no debtor's prison (not anymore, anyway.) I'm not going to address your question about leaving America as that is beyond my purview."

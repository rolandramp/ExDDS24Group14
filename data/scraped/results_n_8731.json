    "title": "In california, if my husband dies with credit card debt in his name only am I responsible to pay the debt?",
    "question": "My husband died with credit card debts on credit cards in his name only, which I never signed on, never used, and never co-signed for either. All of our assets are in a trust, so there will be no probate. Am I responsible for that debt? We did have a credit card that was in both our names that I used and that I have no doubt about paying over time. However, I do not have funds to pay my husband's personal card debt. What should I do and how do I handle the credit card company (BofA) when they come to collect the debt.",

        "You are not personally responsible for your husband's debts. If a bank asked me to pay my deceased spouse's debt from my personal assets, I would likely just say \"no.\" However, I expect you are the trustee of a trust that holds assets of both you and your husband, and that the trust has terms which instruct the trustee to pay the deceased spouse's debts.

With a Judgment, they could then lien the house, and they might get paid latter.\n\nIf the trust has such assets, and if the bank calls, you could ask to settle the debt for a decreased amount. The bank may go for this settlement because they do not want to pay the cost to sue on the hopes that they will get their money back.

    "question": "I have a abstract of judgement lien on my home. It was filed prior to my Chap. 7 filing and subsequent discharge of the debt related to the lien. My bankruptcy (BK) attorney did not file a motion to remove the lien during my BK. Trying to refinance, this lien is an issue. Talked to creditor's attorney, they would like to 'settle' the debt to file a Satisfaction of Judgement. Does having a Homestead Exemption protect me from having to pay this debt. Don't want to reopen Chapt. 7 case....do I have any other options besides paying the debt?",

        "My fellow attorneys have accurately described what must be done. You have to analyze the cost of reopening your case, filing the motion to avoid the lien, paying for an appraisal and attorney vs. a settlement offer for less that the total of these costs. Also, because your original BK atty was not thorough, he/she may be willing to perform the legal fees for little or nothing. Contact your BK attorney, they \"love\" hearing from an aggrieved client.",
        "No. The homestead only allows you to try to avoid the lien....you still have to file a motion and prove up the case. You need to measure the cost of paying a filing and attorney fee to file two motions, one to re-open the BK and one to avoid the lien...versus your cost in directly settling the debt. Either way, there will be a cost to get this refi done. JOE",
        "The Homestead Exemption, or any other exemption for that matter, protects a certain amount of the fair market value of an asset from being used by creditors to satisfy a judgment and by the Trustee from taking the property for the benefit of creditors. The exemption, by itself, does not \"protect\" you from having to pay the judgment debt, but your bankruptcy did protect you. Your personal liability for the judgment debt would have been discharged in your Chapter 7, but, as you have learned, your property is still liable for the debt, meaning the lien survives the bankruptcy and the property can be used to satisfy the judgment SUBJECT TO the application of your homestead exemption. In other words, if you take the fair market value of your property, then subtract 8% to represent closing costs in a hypothetical sale, then subtract your allowable homestead exemption amount, then subtract whatever is still owed to secured creditors (i.e. your 1st mortgage and any 2nd trust deed or home equity line that may still be on the property, you are then left with the maximum dollar amount the judgment creditor might be able to realize if the property were to be sold. I would be willing to bet that number is zero or less than zero. So, as stated, you do not have any personal liability for the debt, and any attempt by the creditor to try to force you to pay could be viewed as a violation of the permanent automatic stay injunction.\n\nHowever, as also stated above, the lien will remain on your property unless removed either voluntarily by the creditor, or a satisfaction of judgment is filed, or you have the lien removed through the bankruptcy court. In spite of your not having any personal liability on the judgment lien, you might feel that paying something to the creditor to remove the lien might seem like a quick and easy solution, especially if the dollar amount involved is relatively low. Personally, I don't like creditors that, in effect, hold your property hostage to try to get you to pay something and, like I said, their attempts to do that could violate the stay. The other option is to re-open your bankruptcy case. You stated you did not want to do that, but I don't know what your reasons are for not wanting to do that.\n\nRe-opening your bankruptcy is a fairly simple process, where you file a motion to re-open, stating the reasons the re-opening of the case is necessary (in this case it would be to be able to file a motion to remove the judgment lien that is clouding title on your property). A filing fee would be required, which is usually less than the original Chapter 7 filing fee. I'm not sure what it would be in your jurisdiction, but in the California Central District it is $260.00. Your court might be a little different, but generally no hearing is even required for the motion to re-open. Once the motion is granted and the case is re-opened, you can then file your motion to remove the judgment lien. Again, that is a fairly straight-forward motion, on a standardized form, that can be granted by the Court without a hearing (unless the creditor feels they have valid grounds to oppose the motion and they request a hearing). Assuming no objection is filed, you would then file a declaration stating that no opposition was filed, and the Court would then grant the motion and order the lien to be removed. Once that order is filed, the Court clerk would then re-close your bankruptcy case. The process of re-opening the case does not re-start any clocks or have any other negative impact on you or your efforts to re-build your post-discharge credit.\n\nI also would suggest you discuss this matter with your former bankruptcy attorney and discuss the issue of due diligence and why the motion was not filed in your case in the first place. Chances are that attorney would probably handle the case re-opening and the related motions at little or not charge.",

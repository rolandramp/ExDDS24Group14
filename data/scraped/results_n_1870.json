    "title": "I owe approximately $40,000 to IRS and approximately $25,000 in personal debt. Is Chap 13 my best option? Thank you",
    "question": "As stated I owe the IRS debt and trying to make payments monthly, but very hard financially. $700 per month alone in IRS payments and they will not work with me on that payment. I now have other person debt due to my situation and quality of life is horrible now. I won't go into detail, but series of events that got me to this place, layoff, etc. I have the IRS debt, student loan $7000 balance and other personal debt as stated $25000. I am working and make $50000 annually. If I file chap 13, how much income will I have left each month after paying the court once chap 13 filed? I am not sure if there is a standard schedule the court goes off of to determine what my payment amount will be once I file 13. Any advice will be very helpful. Thank you very much for your time.",

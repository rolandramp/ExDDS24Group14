    "title": "What forms do I need to file? Can I file without an attorney?",
    "question": "Recently my aunt passed away unexpectedly and my sister and I are the next of kin. My aunt did have my sister and I as beneficiary on her employment benefit and we have received the payout. However, the insurance has issued another check to The Estate Of my aunt. She did leave her home and was on title as a Single Woman. I need to hand the business of her home and deposit the check that was issued to The Estate. Do I petition the court to be named administrator as well as beneficiary for my sister and I? Can I set up an account to deposit the check? What's the procedure and can I file without an attorney?",

    "title": "Can having a warrant for your arrest interfere with the ability to file for Bankruptcy?",
    "question": "I plan to file for Bankruptcy next month so I can have a wage garnishment stopped. But I recently found out that there is a warrant for my arrest that was issued in the beginning of 2013. Will that stop me from being able to file for Bankruptcy? I know Bankruptcy is through the Federal courts but can they arrest me? I appreciate any information that you can give.",

        "The Feds won't arrest you on a warrant for a state charge unless asked by the local police authorities and they probably won't even know you have filed bankruptcy. I strongly urge you to retain counsel and ckear up the outstanding warrant.",
        "List the debt/fine associated with the warrant along with all other debts. It may not be discharged but it needs to be listed anyway. BK is not a DIY project. Consult with a BK lawyer, many of us offer free consultations.",
        "You can still file bankruptcy. However, you will need to attend a meeting of creditors and take two classes required by the bankruptcy court. If you are arrested and can't complete any of these requirements, your bankruptcy case will be dismissed.",
        "You can still file bankruptcy notwithstanding the warrant. The bankruptcy is not going to affect the warrant in any way; the bankruptcy will not provide relief from the warrant. However, having the warrant is not a preclusion to filing bankruptcy.\n\nNow, if the warrant is for something like Securities Fraud or your bilked elderly people out of millions of dollars, etc., the reason for the warrant may have an impact on whether the court believes your bankruptcy is filed in good faith...but in the run of the mill type of situation, one thing (the warrant) has nothing to do with the other (the bankruptcy)."

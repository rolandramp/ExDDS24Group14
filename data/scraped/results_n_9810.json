    "question": "I got separated and I live in CA. I am not legally separated yet and now I need to file for Bankruptcy. I heard that my husband is drowning himself to debt with his credit cards. Can I include his debt even though the card is not under my name? I know that in CA Law, if you are not legally separated, technically you owe half of what he owes. Can I file his debts and can I be protected on his future debts when I'm ready to file for legal separation?",

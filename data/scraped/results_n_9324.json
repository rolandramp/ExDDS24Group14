        "The date of separation is the date one of you communicates to the other that you want out of the marriage. This date is extremely important in that it is a cut-off date for marital assets and debts AND, in short term marriages (less than 10 years), a cut-off for spousal support (generally, half the duration of the marriage). For that reason, people often spend a lot of time and money in attorney's fees battling over the date of separation. It does often happen that one spouse says s/he wants out but then goes into counseling with the other spouse to try and save the marriage. Maybe they stay together for economic reasons, or for the kids. Things muddies the water for what exactly is the date of the separation - hence, mini-trials over this one issue.

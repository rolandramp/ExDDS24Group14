    "question": "My Dad is terminally ill and has credit card debt and personal loan debt. He got the home loan with his VA, but we have always paid the monthly mortgage bill and any other costs associated with the house. What will happen to our house? Can the creditors put a lien on it? Will the lender demand a pay off of the loan since it is a VA loan and only in my Dad's name? What can we do NOW to help the situation. Please help!",

        "I have a little different take. It all comes down to how title is held and what part of the home would become part of your father's estate. I agree that anything in your father's estate is subject to creditors, such as the personal loan and credit cards. If you own the property in joint tenancy, the property will not become part of the estate and will not be subject to those debts.\n\nWith regard to the loan, generally speaking the due on sale clause cannot be enforced on the basis of a death. That means if you continue to pay the loan, you should be able to keep/stay in the property. This of course presumes creditors are not entitled to force a sale through probate.\n\nIt is strongly recommended that you have title of the house reviewed and have the attorney advise you what is best for you from there.",
        "Sorry to hear about your father's health. As to the credit card debt, debts die with people. This means that the any assets your father has can be used to repay any outstanding loans but nobody will be liable for any amounts owed after the assets have been paid out.\n\nAssuming you want to keep the house your family will have to arrange financing to pay the outstanding balance on the loan. Now would be the time to make these arrangements while you can. You should consult with a probate attorney to discuss exactly what needs to be done."

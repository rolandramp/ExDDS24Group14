    "question": "I have a letter from CalPers stating that there were over payments received by me but it was by their mistake and not mine. The letter specifically states that I did not commit any wrongdoing. Is this obligation dischargeable in chapter 7? I filed an now they are still trying to collect these payments.",

        "Without trying to locate and cite all of the research I have done on this previously, I think that although the debt itself is discharged, there is still a right of setoff against money owed to you. I have researched this in regard to Social Security overpayments, state benefit payments of various sorts and for private disability overpayments and found the result the same.\n\nCalPERS money that has been contributed is generally not an asset owned by the individual that made the contribution, thus it is excluded from the bankruptcy estate when filing a bankruptcy case. The property belongs to the State of California (this has been stated strongly by the state when a trustee tried to take that fund in a case I had many years ago). The benefit that the contributor receives or will receive is a debt created under CA law owed by the state to that person.\n\nIf there was an overpayment, inadvertent or not, the state will be allowed to setoff the overpayment against the money owed in the future. After discharge, the state can't come after the person and take money or other assets from them, but they can deduct from future benefit payments. If CalPERS owes you no future benefit, they have no way to collect from you. If they owe you a benefit though, they can deduct the overpayment from the benefit (there are rules as to the percentage or amount they can take from each payment).\n\nAgain, this has been my experience in the cases I have dealt with and researched and can only be my advice in those cases, not yours. However, I was not able to find any way around this setoff. Your case may be different due to circumstances that were different than the cases I reviewed.",
        "The debt is likely dischargeable, but not certain. It will likely turn on how they present their claim in the case, and how far they are willing to fight it. One key piece of information about this is how much we are talking about. If the amount is minimal (e.g. >$1000) you are probably not going to have any problems. But if it is substantially more than that, you will see a fight about this.\n\nYou should get an attorney to represent you for this one for sure.\n\nFeedback is important to all of the attorneys on Avvo as it is the only way we know whether our answers were effective in resolving your question. Please let us know if this answer was helpful in answering your question by hitting the “helpful” button.

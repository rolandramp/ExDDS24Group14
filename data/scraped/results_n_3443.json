        "In California, there is no waiting period to obtain a writ of execution on a money judgment. Meaning, you can obtain such a writ of execution immediately following an entry of a money judgment just by making application to the court clerk. However, a writ of execution to enforce a judgment made, entered, or enforceable pursuant to the California Family Code may require additional steps. I recommend you seek an attorney to assist you with the process, e.g., application, issuance, notice, return, etc.",

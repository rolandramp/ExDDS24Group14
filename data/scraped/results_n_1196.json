        "A reverse mortgage will affect the liquidation analysis or determination as to whether the real property has \"too much equity.\" As a bankruptcy attorney, I review reverse mortgage notes and discuss with the client the loan documents' bankruptcy-specific provisions (e.g., limitations on extensions of further credit) and potential pitfalls.",
        "A reverse mortgage is treated like any other mortgage debt. It has to be listed on the schedules. It is, however, very unusual for there to be both a reverse mortgage and a first mortgage on a property. Their bankruptcy attorney should double check the paperwork and title report.",
        "Sure would have helped if you indicated whether your parents are currently taking withdrawals from their reverse mortgage line of credit. 'Cause if they are, this source of income will cease unless the bankruptcy attorney representing them knows how to deal with this issue. Hope this perspective helps!",
        "For the most part it's treated just the same as a second mortgage. The amount of equity in the property is the most important thing. Your folks definitely have to have an attorney. If they're receiving a monthly payment from the reverse mortgage, they can expect that to probably stop once they file bankruptcy.",
        "A reverse mortgage is treated like any other mortgage when going through a bankruptcy proceeding . The main focus when dealing with real property is equity and whether the equity in the home is protected under the Homestead Exemption. Consult with a bankruptcy attorney in your area.",
        "You will schedule the mortgage debt the same way as with a regular debt, but add that the particular debt is a reverse mortgage and that the balance will be increasing. Your parents need a BK lawyer ASAP. BK is not a DIY project. Some of us offer a free consultation by phone or in person to help you through what can be a legal minefield."

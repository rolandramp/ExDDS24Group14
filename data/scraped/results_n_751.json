        "As already answered by other attorneys, you don't list whether you are incorporated or a sole proprietorship, and even if incorporated, if you are already liable for debts you cannot afford as a result of contracts, personal guarantees, or what is called \"piercing the corporate veil\" to establish personal liability. Pay an attorney in CA to find out those options is my advise. We charge corporations for such advice, but not individuals for reasons beyond this forum. But if you file bankruptcy, other issues and facts can affect your case so I will point some of those out next for you too.\n\nYou need and want to enjoy your fresh start also. But the most important thing is to meet with an\nattorney as you asking this question means you have not. You care about 2 goals: keeping\neverything you have equity in and discharging all your debts. If you don't have any of the\nexceptions to discharge you will obtain that goal; most exceptions are set forth in 11 USC. 523\n(Google it) like child support, some income taxes, traffic (in a ch 7) and criminal fines , and\npresumption of student loans. But some debts are dischargeable in a ch 13 but NOT in a ch 7 so\nyou want to make sure and your attorney will discuss any such types with you also!\nYour exemptions depend on what state you have lived in in the last 2 years and thus if in your\nstate, then your states exemptions will apply. Most persons filing keep everything they own but\nyour attorney will confirm that with you when they learn everything you own and the equity\nthereof!\nSome secured debts like homes, vehicles, other secured debts an attorney will discuss your\noptions on also as you must list any debts; but that does not mean you will lose them unless you\nhave too much equity or are in default on paying for them! Discuss those options if they apply\nwith your attorney too.\nBut other issues can arise that can greatly harm your case. Just one example: If you paid back a\nrelative $3,000 11 months ago and now file bankruptcy next week, the trustee can SUE that\nrelative to retrieve that $3,000 (under what is called a preference) for the benefit of the\nbankruptcy estate. As a result, most attorneys don't charge to meet with them the first meeting so\nmeet with one no matter what.\nMany great attorneys can be found right here on AVVO in your state so look, call, and meet one\nas soon as you can.\nYou should also want to know when to file: is there an advantage of waiting versus filing now\nand who should you pay between now and then! Good luck and enjoy your later fresh start.",

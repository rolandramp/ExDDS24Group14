    "title": "Thanks in advance. I have a debt collection suit for $5,750. Its a debt-buyer, not original creditor. Need to plot next move.",
    "question": "Your community is awesome. Here's my issue. I have a debt collector suing me in Los Angeles County (Chatsworth Courthouse). Its a debt-buyer - not the original creditor. The amount is $5,750. The debt is 3 years and 9 months old. I have no assets that can be levied upon, and I am self-employed. I have called them (I was subserved through the mail) and they were very forth about a settlement. I have one week to file a response in court if I choose to... I know I can get a better settlement if I file a response. How much will it cost me (or should I look to spend on an attorney given this case) to file a response in court to get better leverage to negotiate? I need to know if its worth it, or if I should just negotiate up front.",

        "You have received advice from attorneys from you state. Follow it. I not think that challenging this on your own is a good idea. I have answered a number of similar questions on this site. YOu are the only one who seems to have a clue about what is happening. NOw take the opportunity to discuss your case with an attorney who handles these specific cases. They can be beaten. I handle personal injury cases in Pennsylvania but I have been representing folks on these types of cases. I charge a flat fee of $375 and I say that I will return the fee if the case is not dismissed or withdrawn. THis is somewhat misleading since I do not expect and have never had to return a fee.\nThe junk debt buyer or debt scavenger that claims to own your debt, bought it for pennies on the dollar, maybe even less than $100 and now is suing you for the whole amount. The law permits it and that's fine, but what is not right is that they are trying to seek a judgment against you without the necessary documents to win. They are counting on you doing nothing, or calling and agreeing to pay it and even that you will try to handle it yourself--since they know the rules better than you. The rules that apply are traps for the unwary. Not just any lawyer can handle these cases, not a general business lawyer or a bankruptcy lawyer. You need someone who handles these specific cases. I believe some who have responded fit the bill. You can also try the website for the National association for consumer advocates and find a lawyer near you.\nHere are some of the problems with the lawsuit filed against you. First this debt buyer says it owns your debt. It's their obligation to prove it. How? Produce the bill of sale. Even if they have produced it does it mention your debt?--or does it say it bought some particular 1000s of account set forth on some exhibit or schedule or something like that. It's not attached is it? While we might be able to assume they bought some debts, how do we know they bought yours. Next, this is a breach of contract case. In any breach of contract case and this one should be no different they need to attach a copy of the contract. THey have not produced it or if there is an agreement, it is at best an \"exemplar' of some agreement and not the one you agreed to or signed. Next they are suing you for $5,750.00. How can you agree that is correct. Have they produced all the account statements beginning with a $0 balance so you can see the purchases, the interest, the penalties? IF they attached anything it is the \"last\" statement or a few statements. THe amount they claim is not a provable sum. Sometimes they attempt to make up for all this by adding an affidavit or statement of account that essentially says take our word for it, we own it, she agreed to all this and we checked and the amount is correct. These documents are not business records, they were not made contemporaneously with the events at issue. They were made in anticipation of litigation and are hearsay.\nI am not sure of what the case law in your state says. Sometimes in Pennsylvania they claim something called \"account stated\" to avoid having to produce the all the account statements. Pennsylvania case law rejects that claim but defendants here need someone to make sure the court understands. Again, my suggestion to challenge and likely defeat this claim is to hire counsel who handles these cases regularly. My fee is probably very low and I think I hear chuckling from lawyers in your state. If the lack of documentation and the case law in your state is even close to what it is in Pennsylvania, the money you spend on representation will be worth the cost. Good luck! HIre someone.",
        "Whenever dealing with third party debt collectors and not the original credit grantor I strongly encourage clients to respond to the lawsuit and litigate the case to at the very least discover what evidence the debt collector is relying on to file their claim. Not only is the amount of the debt in question, you also need to know if the debt collector has a legal right to file the claim. Do they have legal ownership of the account and can they prove it in a court of law? I recommend contacting an attorney to discuss the suit and the viable defenses that you can raise before negotiating any settlement with this collector.",

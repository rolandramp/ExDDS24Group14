    "title": "Voyager Financial bought 10 years of my V.A payments. Cna they be included in Chapter 13 since V.A payments can not be bought?",
    "question": "I needed money and Veteran Benefits Leverage placed me with Voyager Financial to sell 10 years of payments for a lump-sum of cash. I then found out Veterans Payments can not be sold under 38 USC ยง 5301. A year later after making payments I filed Chapter 13 and they filed a complant saying they bought 10 years of my payments. Being that V.A paments can not be sold or assigned to a 3rd party, it's now consider a loan depending how you look at it. I read that some Bankruptcy Courts ruled that they are a loan and allowed them to be discharded like in Norfolk Virginia, but I'm unable to look it up. Voyager financial has been issued a Cease and Desist Letter to stop business in Little Rock, Ark. They changed their name to BAIC and still filed the complaint letter on their investors part.",

        "If Voyager files an objection to your Plan, your attorney will know how to respond. If you don't have one, get one fast. I believe the characterization of the assignment of non-assignable assets to be a loan, subject to discharge in BK favorable to you. Good luck.",
        "The debt is certainly dischargeable. The issue is whether they have a security interest in your VA payments; and 38 USC 5301 seems to confirm that they do not. Be careful, though, that there is no basis for claiming that the debt is non-dischargeable based on fraud wherein you knew that the VA payments were not assignable when you took the loan.",
        "You may have another issue as well. You are now admitting in a public forum to a knowing (albeit after the fact) violation of 5301. VA could then make a determination that an overpayment was created and demand repayment (for the compensation payments that improperly flowed to the lender). I deal with a lot of VA overpayment issues and VA is merciless when they make an overpayment determination. Find a local attorney that understands VA."

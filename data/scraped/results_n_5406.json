    "question": "I am going to dissolve a c-corp, shall I close business bank account before dissolution, or after dissolution? I want to file final tax return for 2012, because there are no business activity for this c-corp (just several thousand dollars bill paid in 2013). My CPA says it is better to close bank account before dissolution, then file final tax return for 2013 ( report to IRS on March 2014) .",

        "When a Florida corporation (C corp or S corp) is dissolved, it must stop conducting any new business and continues in existence only for the purpose of winding up its former business and liquidating its business and affairs. Part of the winding up process is selling the corporation's equipment and other assets and paying the corporation's bills. I recommend that you leave the corporation's bank account open after the dissolution and until such time as the last of the corporation's assets are sold and the proceeds of sale are deposited into the corporation's bank account, and until all corporate debts and shareholder liquidating distributions are satisfied from the corporation's funds. At such time, you may close the corporation's bank account if you believe that there is no need for any further payments to be made by the dissolved corporation to another person. Note that any asset liquidations, payments of creditors and shareholder distributions that occurred in 2013 should be reported by the dissolved corporation on its 2013 tax return assuming that the corporation is a cash-basis taxpayer. The 2013 tax return will be the corporation's final tax return assuming the corporation's affairs are wound up by December 31, 2013.",
        "You CPA is partially correct. You should close the bank account before you dissolve the corp. File you final return in 2013, not 2014 because you would also have to file a corporte tax return for 2014 if you file in 2014."

    "question": "There are 3 shareholders for a MA corp: A, B, and C. A is a CA corp, and B, C are individuals. A owns 55%, B and C own 45% of the MA corp. D is an individual who owns 100% of A. However, the capital for the MA corp from A, B, and C is not enough for a project. Without changing the shares, they want to do the following:",

        "Generally, shareholders can lend money to their corporations and corporations acn borrow from their shareholders. Whether CA corp can loan to MA corp depends on its financial situation. If it is a one person corporation and the loan wouldn't redner it insolvent or unable to service its own debt, it should be fine.\n\nWhat your business and tax attorney would need to know is whether MA corporation is an S corporation. Then it can make a difference, because a shareholder loan creates additional outside basis and can trigger undesirable tax consequences down the road.\n\nIf MA corp is not an S corporation, it can also issue a second class of preferred stock that functions much like debt.\n\nYou are right that a guarantee by a corporate debtor is worthless.\n\nSince D is the third shareholder through A, I have to wonder whether it is really appropriate for B and C to personally guarantee a loan 100% rather than 45%. Is it really the deal that B and C take on liability personally if the MA corp can't pay back A or D's loan to it?\n\nYou really should talk this through with a skilled local business and tax attorney.",
        "CA corporations can loan money to other individuals and corporations, if their Bylaws say so, and the Bylaws may also have restrictions on how these loans can be made.\n\nIf the MA corporation is making these loans, rather than the individuals who happen to be the MA corporation's shareholders, then you need to re-post under MA, because MA corporate law, and the MA corporation's Bylaws, governs what the MA corporation can do (even if one of the shareholders is a CA corporation).\n\nThere should be a provision in the MA corporationj's By laws that says that personally guaranteed debts are NOT excluded from officer's and director's personal liability.

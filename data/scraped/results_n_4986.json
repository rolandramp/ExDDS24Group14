        "I offer complimentary consultations to those struggling with student loans (nationwide). The only way to know your options is to get more information than should be provided on a public forum like this.",
        "Call Sallie Mae and explain your situation. You may be eligible for a forbearance, smaller payments, interest only payments, or some other option. Very unlikely that these loans are dischargeable in bankruptcy. Good luck.",
        "Student loans are very difficult, as you probably know. There was a recent decision by the 9th Circuit (California is in the 9th Circuit so it apples) whereby a former law student was able to get a partial discharge of his student loan debt. As long as you have been making a good faith effort (so you may have some time to go before you reach this element) and if you can show you have tried to maximize your income and minimize your expenses, you could qualify for at least a partial discharge. You should seek the advice of a bankruptcy attorney familiar with this case: Hedlund v. Educational Resources. I've attached a link to the decision. Getting a forbearance is temporary relief leading to more pain later. The other action you should take at this time is contacting your congresspersons and support recent legislation brought by Senator Warren and others. Good luck."

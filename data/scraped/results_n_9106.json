        "Property taxes are secured by the tax lien on the property, so the lender will need to pay it off to do anything with the property, which will get you off the hook in short order. It is highly unlikely (I never say never) that the credit reporting agencies will get any information about unpaid property taxes from the county tax assessor. However, it is possible that the lender would pay off the taxes and add it to the amount of your loan, which will appear on your credit reports.\n\nWhether the lender is entitled to the unpaid balance after foreclosure was not clear from your posting, as this mainly concerns whether the loan was used to purchase the property or if it was a refinancing or equity line of credit. If used to purchase your home, the California anti-deficiency statute should protect you from owing the unpaid balance.",

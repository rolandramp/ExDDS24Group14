    "question": "My brother is currently serving time in jail and has asked for me to look into power of attorney for him. What is the easiest way to do this and is it something I can do without a lawyer? I also want to make sure I keep my family protected and need to ensure that if someone went after him for something, that I would not be affected. Any advice is greatly appreciated.",
    "answers": [
        "I agree with the other responses. A Power of Attorney is an inexpensive form to obtain from a lawyer. The lawyer can also tend to getting it executed, which could save you a lot of hassle. You would not be personally responsible for any of your brother's debts or liabilities. You would simply be acting as agent, so that you could handle any of his affairs that he cannot take care of because of his incarceration.\n\nJames Frederick",
        "A power of an attorney allows you to sign the name of and act on behalf of another person (not as a lawyer but as an agent.) There are numerous power of attorney forms online for free.",
        "Your best bet would be to have an attorney draft the document and take it to the jail for proper explanation and execution.\nThis is not something you should try yourself."

    "answers": [
        "Before anything can be seized or money levied by a creditor or debt collector, they first must file a lawsuit and obtain a judgment, which requires that they show you received notice of the lawsuit. If you were served, you should contact an experienced collection defense attorney to assist you in this case and explore your options, at that time. I handle such cases throughout California.\n\nIf the situation is that they now have a judgment against you, then it is possible they can get a court to order the sale of your possessions, if they can prove to the judge that the value of the items exceeds the applicable exemption amounts. I doubt that they will be able to show this or that they will bother, unless you have vehicles or some valuable artwork or jewelry in storage."

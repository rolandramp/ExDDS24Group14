    "title": "Do I need to have a copy of Form SC-134, the blank Form SC-133, and Form SC-107 PERSONALLY SERVED on the debtor?",
    "question": "I was involved in an auto accident. I sued the driver and registered owner in small claims and received a judgment. The defendant's insurance company provided them with a lawyer who appealed the small claims judgment. At the appeal the defendants agreed to submit to a judgment from the court of $5,000. The insurance company already paid me a little more than $1,900 but no more. The defendants themselves have not paid anything. I want to request a debtors exam and I need to have the defendants served with Forms SC-134, SC-133, and SC 107. However I was informed that these documents need to be PERSONALLY SERVED on the defendants which would be difficult at best. Is this true? Can't I just have these documents served on their attorney? If not, would substituted service be sufficient?",

Also, if the judgment debtor fails to appear, the court can issue a bench warrant.",

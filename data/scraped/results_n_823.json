    "title": "Can a person file Chapter 13 to avoid a sanctions award for violating the injunction against the collection of discharged debt?",
    "question": "Federal BK court has awarded me all my attorney fees after a habitual litigator took me to court illegally after being notified of my BK. Now that judgement debtor is threatening to file Chapter 13 to avoid paying me. He cannot file Chapter 7, having done so in 2012.",

    "answers": [
        "Unless the \"threatened\" Chapter 13 Plan provides 100% payment to you, consider the language of 11 USC ยง523 which lists the so-called \"bankruptcy crimes\" which identifies the kinds of transaction which are non-dischargeable. Subparagraph 6 says: \"(6) for willful and malicious injury by the debtor to another entity or to the property of another entity;\" If the sanction was issued against the debtor for willful and malicious injury, you can make out a credible claim it is non-dischargeable. That said, the burden is on you to timely file a complaint to determine dischargeability. If you don't, your debt will be discharged. This is not a DIY project. Depending on the amount of your sanction award, you should find, consult, and hire a BK atty to represent your interests.",
        "I believe that it would be a dischargeable debt in a Chapter 13 case. I don't see any exception to discharge that would apply to it.",
        "Statements that a person will file a bankruptcy case are not the same as actually filing such a case. The intent may be to get you to take less than the full amount owed.\n\nIf the habitual litigator does file a chapter 13 he/she must list you as a creditor, and you will get notice of the bankruptcy soon after it is filed. If that does happen you may be able to object to a chapter 13 plan that seeks to discharge the debt owed to you. If that does happen you should hire an attorney to help protect your interests."

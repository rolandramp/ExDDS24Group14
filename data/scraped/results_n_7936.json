    "title": "How can you discharge intentional torts in Chapter 13 bankrutpcy?",
    "question": "I have a question related to the discharge of intentional torts in Chapter 13 bankruptcy. I am in the middle of litigation where a person is suing me for intentional torts and fraud and a tentative decision has been entered against me. I read that intentional torts are not dischargeable in Chapter 7 bankruptcies but are dischargeable in Chapter 13 bankrupties. How does this work, and will it work for my situation? Also, I sought some free advice from a bankruptcy attorney who said the person trying to sue me might start an adversarial proceeding, is this correct? Does anyone do this kind of work who can give some guidance? Thanks.",

        "I agree generally with the other comments made. If a creditor wants to have a debt allegedly for fraud to survive any bankruptcy it must file a lawsuit within the bankruptcy which is called an adversary proceeding. The things I want to add are (1) creditors rarely challenge bankruptcy cases even when they have grounds presumeably because they do not want to pay a lawyer for the adversary if the obligor/debtor is unable pay even if they win and (2) in chapter 13 a person can be protected for up to 5 years even if the debt is not discharged which deters adversary proceedings",
        "Depending on the court and the type of intentional tort the debt may be dischargeable in either a 7 or a 13. An adversary can be brought by any creditor to have a debt declared non-dischargeable.",
        "Some intentional tort debts may be dischargeable. If you have debts for fraud, conversion, embezzlement, breach of fiduciary duty you may ask the Bankruptcy Judge to discharge them in a Chapter 13 case. In order for the debt to be discharged the Judge has to confirm your Chapter 13 plan of repayment and you HAVE to complete the confirmed repayment plan. However, the key is that you must make your \"best efforts\" to pay back some percentage of \"intentional tort debts\".\nIf you file your case as a chapter 7 case, you may be able to discharge those debts if, and only if, the creditor fails to file an \"adversary proceeding\" against you within 30 days after the 341(a) hearing. The likelihood of that happening is slim, however, if you feel that there is a probability that the creditor will not file (for whatever reason), then you should go forward with the Chapter 7. If the creditor does file, you can then convert your case to a Chapter 13 case keeping in mind that there are requirements that have to be met with either a Chapter 7 or 13 case.\nIn order for the creditor to challenge the discharge, he MUST file the adversary proceeding in both instances.",

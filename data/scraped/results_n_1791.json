    "title": "Can I purchase a car without approval in a chapter 13?",
    "question": "When I filed for chapter 13 I told the trustee is was giving up my car I have now due to the cost and wanted to get another car. Im in chapter 13 now and found a car for less money and I have a coapplicant who is bringing my finance rate down for more savings. My attorney is very slow to respond to me when he does respond. Knowing that, it will be another 4 weeks before I will get an approval through my attorney to get the car. I need one now or very soon. If I wait, the car will be gone, and I will have to try and find another that is a good deal with low mileage. We are talking under 10,000 dollars. Can I purchase the car with my coapplicant now and then ask for approval from the trustee?",
    "answers": [
        "You could be forced out of your bankruptcy. The deal will be there in a month or it won't. Get approval first.",
        "Being here in Sacramento for 37 years I have come to know intimately the workings of both the Bankruptcy Courts & Judges as well as the Chapter 13 Trustees in these situations. Here are the facts under the law and processes here.\n\n1) The law itself is clear that you cannot incur any significant debt as others have stated without Court approval.\n\n2) Most SMART lenders are going to have you sign something stating you are not in bankruptcy or are going to do a credit check watching for that type of situation. Yes there are a lot of stupid lenders and you might get away with them selling you the car but that is ill advised. There is some case law that I looked at many years ago that compares a person in bankruptcy as like a minor child. You have no legal ability to incur debt. They may not have an enforceable contract.\n\n3) Typically you can make a motion to incur debt to buy a car within set parameters. The dollar amount and interest rate have changed over the years but your attorney can check as to what the court approves under the general orders or with the Chapter 13 Trustee.\n\n4) Just because you want to purchase a car on payments even if it is within those parameters does not mean that the Court will approve it or that the Trustee won't oppose it. You have to show: why you NEED the vehicle; how you are going to AFFORD the monthly payments; and that it is not going to cause you to be unable to make your plan payments. If it is going to cause your plan to fail and if you cannot modify your plan to succeed, it is not going to be approved by the Court.\n\n5) Remember, there is a reason you are in a Chapter 13. It is to have Court protection from your creditors. You can lose that and fail completely if this is not carefully and completely thought out and done right.\n\n6) I have seen people kicked out of their Chapter 13 cases for failing to get Court approval and improperly incurring debt. Doing so is a violation of your agreement with the Court and the creditors. Remember, you have been ORDERED not to incur debt as part of this agreement. Judges do not take kindly to your breaching their orders.\n\n7) Having a co-signor and using their credit is an invitation to disaster. Frankly, the person who uses their credit to help someone in bankruptcy buy a car or anything else is extremely foolish. There is a reason you are in enough financial trouble you have to be protected by the bankruptcy filing. That is not to say that you did anything wrong at all. The reason often is because things happened that were beyond your control. It is saying that your circumstances are precarious at best. Almost inevitably what I see is things go South and the payments cannot be made so the car is repossessed and sold. The Co-signor/guarantor/primary or whatever gets nailed. Friends become former friends or enemies, rifts and bad blood happen between family members. Do them a favor. Don't make your problem, their problem.\n\n8) Finally, having them buy the car in their name on their credit with you paying the car payment is STILL BORROWING money. It may be an oral agreement but if you don't pay, I can guarantee you they believe you owe the money for the car whether to them or the finance company. Even that situation is a violation of your obligation to the Court and your plan. Don't do it.\n\nAll of this should be well known to any skilled bankruptcy attorney. Hopefully you have one like that. If you don't and you are representing yourself, my condolences. Representing yourself in Chapter 13 never works. Just ask the trustee's about the prose success rate (0%). Representing yourself is like doing your own brain surgery. It never ends well.",
        "The problem isn't acquiring a car, it is taking out new debt. If you have a friend willing to take on the burden of the financing without you being on the paperwork, that probably will be the solution that will work the best. Hope this perspective helps!",
        "As your attorney presumably explained to you, you cannot successfully incur new debt in excess of $1000 while in a Chapter 13 without first getting court approval. The reason is that your confirmed Plan is based on your budget and since the new car payment is not included in that budget, it works a disadvantage on the creditors who are getting paid via the Plan. By filing a motion, it gives existing creditors a chance to object. However, if the new car payment is equal to or less than the car payment in the Plan, you might have a good chance of approval since no creditor would be compromised. Your other options are to incur the debt then seek court approval, or incur the debt and modify your Plan to cover the Also, you might try to pay the new car payment outside of the Plan. That approval comes after a motion is filed with the court explaining why the new debt is necessary.",
        "I assume that Sacramento and Fresno are in the same district and if I am correct, then Mr. Waddell's answer is spot on. Your district probably has rules about what amount of debt a debtor can incur without court approval. In my district (Eastern District of NC) a debtor can incur debt of $7,500 or less without court approval. I have no idea what the threshold is in your district, but I suspect that court approval will be required. I agree that it is unwise to pick a particular car and then to seek court approval. What works better is to get court approval to incur debt at certain parameters (say $15k at no more than X% with a monthly payment no more than $Y/month), the go find a specific car that fits within those parameters.",
        "Excellent advice from Gabriel John Waddell.\nYes. You can make to purchase without approval.\nHowever, not recommended because it is violation of C13 Plan and Confirmation terms.\nSome alternatives:\n-friend or family member purchase vehicle and allow you to drive in interim until you obtain approval\n-petition for approval of future purchase, obtain approval, then make the purchase\nI realize these are not perfect solutions. My be best available under circumstances.\nReview with you BK counsel.",
        "You are not allowed to incur debt without court authorization. In some jurisdictions, you will need a court order authorizing you to incur debt to purchase a car. In other jurisdictions, like mine, you just need to get an authorization letter from the trustee to incur debt to purchase a car. Some people ignore the requirement to get court authorization and usually nothing happens to them. I would not recommend that you do anything that would put your bankruptcy case in jeopardy. Talk to your attorney and follow his advice. Most finance companies simply will not finance you without court approval once they pull your credit and see that you are in bankruptcy. Good luck to you.",
        "You could, but I wouldn't recommend it. You would technically be breaking bankruptcy court rules to incur debt without court approval, and could jeopardize your discharge.\n\nBottom line is that this is a difficult process in Chapter 13. I've walked many clients through it, but it is always complicated. Because of the delay involved when getting approval, debtors generally cannot pick a car and then sit on it until the court approves the transaction, because dealers can't hold cars that long. However, I've had clients find success when they get approved for a loan, we get the loan approved through the court (which can be difficult), and then they take that approved loan to purchase a car.\n\nYou'll need your attorney to walk you through this potential minefield, so I'd recommend you try to set up an appointment to discuss in person. Hopefully that will get the ball rolling soon, but do brace yourself for a complicated process. Best of luck to you."

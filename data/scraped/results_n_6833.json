        "The clerk of the court will file plaintiff's request for entry of default if you did not file an \"answer\" to plaintiff's complaint. If you do nothing, plaintiff will eventually request a default judgment for the amount of debt (the \"damages\") specified in plaintiff's complaint, plus interest, costs and attorney fees. Thereafter, plaintiff will garnish your wages and levy your assets, such as bank accounts. So long as there is a balance due for the judgment, the judgment will accrue 10% interest per year on the unpaid balance. Plaintiff also is entitled to add to the judgment its costs to enforce the judgment.\n\nIf you wish to defend plaintiff's lawsuit, I suggest you call plaintiff's counsel ASAP and ask him to stipulate to set aside the default so you can file your answer and litigate the case. If he refuses, then I recommend you consult with a debt collections defense attorney who practices in the county in which the lawsuit was filed. Your attorney might agree to file a motion to set aside the default and default judgment so you can file your answer and litigate (defend) the case. If no one handed you or mailed you a copy of the summons and complaint, it will be easier to persuade the court to set aside the default and default judgment. Courts do favor litigation on the merits.\n\nIf you prefer to pay or settle the inevitable default judgment, you will need to contact plaintiff's attorney. If plaintiff agrees to settle for less than the full amount of the judgment, make sure plaintiff itself (not just its attorney) SIGNS a written agreement; the agreement should state that plaintiff releases its claims against you.\n\nAnother option is to file bankruptcy. However, this should be your last resort. If you are considering bankruptcy, then consult with a bankruptcy attorney.\n\nBest wishes.",
        "If you owe the debt, the best thing is to settle it.\n\nIf you dispute the debt and wish to contest it, the best thing is to hire a lawyer to file a motion to set aside default (and vacate default judgment if necessary).",
        "Agree with other counsel, depending on what the debt is for and how much it might not be worth fighting, Winn Law Offices is a creditors' attorney office that handles litigation for creditors owed money. Set up payment arrangements to avoid bank levy or wage garnishments. If you own real estate property, creditor will more than likely file a lien against that, in which case if you sell at profit above what is owed on mortgages creditor will be paid from proceeds, you receive what is remaining (not a common scenario now a days with so many properties underwater). Another option, although there are many facts to be explored is to file bankruptcy and discharge the debt. Judgment in California are good for 10 years, can carry as much as 9% interest, and are renewable infinite number of times over your lifetime as long as creditor chooses to renew.",
        "If this is for a credit card or some other type of debt which you truly owe and no dispute or defenses, attempting to fight it will only cost more money and only delay the inevitable if the plaintiff is truly set on pursuing it. If it is a small amount then it might be worth fighting and doing discovery to make it not worth the hassle to pursue for the other side and they will dismiss it. This will cost more in attorney fees so you have to decide how much is it worth to you because it is not guaranteed to work but probably the best method of contesting a debt.",

If the default has not yet been entered, you need to immediately file and serve your answer. If default has already been entered, you need to immediately bring a motion to set aside default so you can file your answer. Time is of the essence.

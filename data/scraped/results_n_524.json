    "title": "Should i dissolve my S corporation or file bankruptcy?",
    "question": "My \"S Corp\" company based in Los Angeles has fallen on hard times, and i do not want to continue to pay the FTB. I owe the FTB about $800-900. An additional annual FTB $800 fee, will be added soon, unless i close the company i believe. The company has no assets, and about 4-6 K in liabilities. It is more of a \"hot item\" business or more seasonal in nature. The bulk of the sales are normally October through December. Hot items have become far and few. We basically distribute products to retail stores. China trade problems and internet price pressure have made the business very difficult.",

        "If there are enough assets to pay debts, you can dissolve without any dissolution court proceedings or bankruptcy. Please do this with a creditors rights atty and your accountant. There will be questions along the way and you want to do this correctly so that you end with no personal liability.",
        "My colleagues have given you good advice, to which I add the following: You can simply let the corporation \"die\" without doing anything. Eventually, the Dept of Corporations will suspend it for non-payment of annual fees.",
        "When an S-corporation is solvent, dissolving the S-corporation is just a matter of winding down operations and filing the final dissolution documents. Moreover, even before you dissolve your S-corporation, you typically must draft a corporate resolution that’s approved by the board of directors. The Internal Revenue Service requires that you file Form 966, Corporate Dissolution or Liquidation, within 30 days after the corporate resolution is approved. Corporate assets are sold and final payments are made to your employees, creditors and state and federal tax collecting agencies. Typically it is then that you must file a notice of dissolution with your incorporating state’s department of corporations. When the final tax returns are filed and accepted, your S-corporation is dissolved. However, if it’s insolvent, your incorporating state may not allow you to dissolve your S-corporation until the debts are paid.\nDuring this time, your creditors can sue you for the unpaid amounts. The IRS can place a lien on your business property or levy your assets if you fail to pay your taxes. In this case, your choices are to continue trying to reach a payment agreement with your creditors or file for bankruptcy.\nIf you file a Chapter 7 bankruptcy, an automatic stay comes into effect. This prevents any unpaid employees, creditors and even the IRS from pursuing collection activities against your S-corporation. A bankruptcy trustee takes control of your S-corporation and sells the assets. Court and attorney fees, employees, payroll taxes and corporate taxes are paid first. If any money remains, the secured creditors followed by the unsecured creditors are paid. When the bankruptcy is completed, you’ll receive an \"Order of Discharge,\" which effectively dissolves the S-corporation. You’ll still need to file the final dissolution documents with the IRS and your incorporating state.\nA Chapter 11 reorganization bankruptcy allows your S-corporation to remain in business while restructuring your debt. The bankruptcy trustee oversees your business operations but leaves your assets untouched. Your creditors must work with you to restructure your debt repayment. If an agreement can’t be reached, the bankruptcy court can force the creditors to accept a repayment plan. When the bankruptcy is complete, you’ll receive an \"Order of Discharge\" but remain a going concern. If your S-corporation can’t meet the repayment agreement, you are then forced, in essence, to file a Chapter 7 and liquidate the business.\nThat's the background--only you can make the decision.",
        "Attorney Bernard gave you an excellent analysis. I would only add that if you personally guaranteed and of the corporation'a debt you would still be liable for that. Depending on how much of the debt you guaranteed, a personal bankruptcy may be appropriate."

        "You are both required to serve a \"schedule of Assets and Debts\" on each other containing a complete list of all assets and debts that you have, regardless whether they community property or your separate property. You cannot obtain a divorce without serving it on the other side. On the last page you must sign it under penalty of perjury. So if you fail to disclose an asset you are doing perjury and if you get caught you can be punished for perjury. So, don't fail to disclose assets.\n\nThomas Neil is a Sacramento attorney, with 20 years experience representing clients in Sacramento, the Bay Area, and surrounding counties. Or, if you cannot afford full representation then Mr. Neil can write you the forms and declaration you need, help you serve them, tell you what to say and you can go to court by yourself. A well written declaration by an attorney, supported by proper evidence, will GREATLY increase your chances of success in court.\n\nThomas A Neil\n3224 El Camino Avenue\nSacramento, CA 95821\n(916) 446-4153",
        "You have to disclose the statements. Otherwise they can file a motion to compel, get a court order that you provide the statements and also pay their attorney's fees for motion/appearing at court.\nI know of several instances when people tried saving money on an attorney, but ended up paying more to a paralegal who didn't do the job right.",
        "You should probably use an attorney instead of a paralegal. Then you would be able to receive legal advice about your rights in a divorce. As Mr. Gould-Saltman indicated however, you have a duty to exchange financial information in a divorce. Don't hide your assets.\n\nBest of luck,\n\n-Sanjay Paul",
        "Not at all; to get divorced in California, you and he are required to disclose ALL financial information to each other. If you conceal the information, and it later turns out that you concealed an account, the court can award the ENTIRE account (not just half) to the other party."

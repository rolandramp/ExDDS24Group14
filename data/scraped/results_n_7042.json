        "A discharge comes generally within 4 to 6 months.

        "In the Central District of California, which is likely where you filed, the discharge normally comes about 90 days after the meeting of creditors.

        "My colleagues are correct. Generally, the discharge will occur approximately 65 days after the 341 meeting. You can also check on the Notice of Filing of Chapter 7 Bankruptcy, Meeting of Creditors and Deadlines. Right under the Box headed Presumption of Abuse, under 11 USC ยง707(b), there is a box titled Deadlines which lists the deadline to file an objection to discharge.\n\nIf no objections to discharge are filed prior to that date and you have submitted your required Financial Management course certificate, you should get your discharge shortly after that date.",
        "Generally, a Chapter 7 case last around 90 days. Your first creditors meeting (or 341 meeting) will be within 30-45 days after you file your bankruptcy. Subsequently, you have about 60-65 until the Court will sign your discharge paper.\n\nThere is a reason why you have to wait 2 months after attending your 341 meeting. First, as stated above, you have to take your financial management counseling course. Essentially, this is the second credit counseling course that you would have taken in regards to your bankruptcy. The first credit counseling should have been taken prior to your bankruptcy filing (at least within 180 days of you filing). If both classes have not been taken, than the Court will keep your case open and eventually dismiss your case without a discharge for you failing to take the classes.\n\nAnother reason may be that you have signed a reaffirmation agreement. Sometimes, depending on your court and judges, they will require a separate hearing regarding your eligibility to sign the reaffirmation agreement to your secured property. Another reason could be that you have un-exempt assets that the Trustee wants to get hold of and sell to distribute to your creditors. It also could be that one of your creditors has filed a objection to your discharge and/or exemptions.\n\nSorry for the multiple scenarios, but as you may have guessed, there are a lot of reasons for the holdup. Getting the Pacer account is good and you should try to look yourself up by the social security you listed on your bankruptcy petition (as stated above). If you can't find it, than contact your bankruptcy court clerk to assist you.\n\nIf you don't have an attorney already or in helping you with your Chapter 7 case, you don't necessarily need one now. However, you can contact your local legal assistance organization that offers free advice and assistance to the community."

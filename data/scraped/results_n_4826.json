        "When did you file your 2nd bankruptcy? Did you receive a discharge? How much do you owe the \"other credit cards\"?\nThey can sue you ... and receive a judgment for what you owe - but it would be extremely rare for them to go after your car.",
        "All the professionals who respond to Avvo questions do their best to assess the questions and factual details in order to respond with helpful answers. Having said that, I would not advise you to simply ignore the collection letter.\n\nThere may be more details to sort through before arriving at the best option for you. If you're contemplating bankruptcy (again), you are best advised to take a few consultations from bankruptcy lawyers first, before concluding if it is (or is not) the best possible solution at this time. Your question here is a step in the right direction... now make a few calls to local bankruptcy lawyers for professional assistance and continue to be your own best advocate, just as you have been doing.\n\nBest of luck",
        "I wouldn't bother with bankruptcy, personally. I assume you have no significant assets for this purpose. You have very small debt and are very likely \"judgment proof\" (a term that actually means you have just about no income or assets a creditor could attach).\n\nI wouldn't hurt to seek out a free consultation with a local bankruptcy attorney to get more information, but I think it's very likely you could just ignore the letter. What could they really do, except get a judgment against you that is ultimately worthless?"

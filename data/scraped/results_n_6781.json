    "title": "How many times can a bank account be levied for each Writ of Execution in California?",
    "question": "After the initial levy of a bank account in California which only collected a portion of the monies owed to a creditor, can a new levy be issued on the same Writ of Execution; or does a new writ have to be granted to levy the same account again before the writ expires?",
    "question_tags": "Bankruptcy,Debt,Bankruptcy and debt",
    "answers": [
        "A writ of execution is valid for 180 days (approx. 6 months) from the date it was issued, but it's only valid for the county for which it was issued. As other counsel said, the judgment creditor can instruct a levying officer to levy upon assets located in the writ's designated county so long as the writ is valid. Once the writ has expired -- or before expiration if the judgment creditor returns the original writ to the court -- the judgment creditor can pay a $25 court fee to have a new writ issued for any particular county.",
        "The same Writ of Execution can be used again, and again, on the same bank account or on other bank accounts, or other assets, for so long as the Writ remains in effect. You should file a Claim of Exemption if the levy causes such a financial hardship that you are unable to pay for necessities of life. You can get the forms (2 pages) from the Sheriff or online. You should serve a copy of the Claim of Exemption upon the Sheriff before the Sheriff forwards the money to the creditor.",
        "You need a California attorney for specifics, but as long as the judgment is valid, collections actions can proceed.",
        "As long as the writ is good, it can be levied multiple times."

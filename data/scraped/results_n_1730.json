        "Discharge only relieves you of personal liability on the debt.\nYou must continue to make payments or the vehicle can be repossessed. If vehicle repossessed, you are not personally liable for the debt.\nYou may obtain free and clear title after the loan is paid off.",
        "The lien on the car survived the BK. You will have to negotiate a mutually agreement/amount to pay the lender the value of the car. You must keep insurance on the car. If they want, now that the automatic stay has been dissolved, the lender can actually repossess the car without any notice to you. You should check KBB value, then call them to negotiate a number. Good luck.",
        "If you want the title to the car, you work out a deal with the lender. You may get it for less than you owe. frankly, I'm surprised they didn't file a relief from stay and seize the car during the bankruptcy.",
        "Pay off the loan to recover title.\n\nYour discharge (only) stops a creditor/auto lender from suing you if you fall behind on payments. The discharge does not award you with a free vehicle. The auto lender maintains its lien against the vehicle - the lien secured by the auto loan documents. As a rule, liens survive bankruptcy.\n\nBottom line: If you fail to make payments your car can be repossessed by the auto lender. You cannot simply walk away with the car now that you received a discharge in your case.",
        "Unfortunately, it doesn't work that way. The lender has a secured claim against the vehicle. A bankruptcy does not vacate, void, or discharge that secured claim (i.e. lien). The bankruptcy discharges your \"personal\" obligation to pay the loan (hence, that is why it is reported the way it is on your credit report). Think of it like this, the car is also liable for the debt. You filed bankruptcy, not your car. You discharged your obligation on the car loan, but not the car's obligation.\n\nIf there was still a balance due on the loan when you filed the bankruptcy case, you don't get title. You still need to pay off the secured claim in order to get title. Note, if you haven't been making payments, you may be in for a repossession surprise."

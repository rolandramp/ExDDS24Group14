        "Filing bankruptcy is usually considered a default under the terms of your vehicle loan agreement even if you remain current on the payments. The lender has the right to repossess the vehicle. Usually Ford will do this although most other car companies will allow you to keep the vehicle as long as you remain current. It is usually not a good idea to reaffirm a car loan if you know in the future there is a chance you will fall behind on payments because you will be personally liable for the reaffirmed debt. You can seek to have to bankruptcy opened to reaffirm the debt but it depends on the Judge in your case as to whether it will be allowed. You would need to research the Judge and what his/her stand on the issue is.",

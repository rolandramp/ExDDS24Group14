        "I agree with all the above answers. However, I would add one more thing. Do NOT rely on what is listed on your credit report. Many creditors do not report to credit reporting agencies (CRAs.) For example, most medical providers do not report to the CRAs. The same is true for debts to individuals, friends and relatives. Add to that, most tax debt will not show up there.\n\nFinally, I agree with their advice. At minimum consult with a very competent bankruptcy attorney. Preferrably hire one. This is not \"fill out the papers yourself and all will be well.\" People lose cars, homes, tax refunds, bank accounts and much more. Worse yet people are kicked out of bankruptcy and some end up in Federal prison.\n\nDo yourself a huge favor and see a quality bankruptcy attorney to find out what can be done for you and what is protected. Your case would be filed in the Bankruptcy Court in Sacramento. I would recommend you find a quality bankruptcy attorney by looking at Avvo's 10.0 ratings for Sacramento attorneys.\n\nYou could also look at the California State Bar website for a Certified Bankruptcy Law Specialist in Sacramento. Less than 1 in 1000 attorneys are State Bar Certified Bankruptcy Law Specialists.

        "The best advice you have received here is to be accurate in your bankruptcy petition and schedule.

You do not want to be lazy about listing debts properly, you have an affirmative duty to be accurate.",
        "This really isn't the way to do a Bankruptcy Petition. If a lawyer on this site were to give you advice, she or he could end up in trouble if something didn't go well. Also, this isn't going to be the only question you have. Bankruptcy is complicated.\n\nIt would be 1000 times better, for reasons I shouldn't guess at (because I don't know your situation), for you to hire a licensed attorney who understands Bankruptcy law."

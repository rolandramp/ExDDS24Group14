    "title": "Do I have to file a probate when my mothers estate is insoluble?",
    "question": "I know I'm supposed to file if her assets are over $100,000. However she owes a mortgage of $97,000, medical of 6,000 (also Medi-cal is requesting 12,500back), 10,000 in credit card debt, and other small debt. The estate if we're are lucky is worth maybe $130,000. And I haven't made a house payment since she died 2 months Oct will be 3. So would I get in trouble if I didn't file probate and just walk?!",

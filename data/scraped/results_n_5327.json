    "title": "Should I sign a stipulation for entry of judgment after settling with credit card company?",
    "question": "I have settle with a credit company outside of the court but now they want me to sign a stipulation for entry of judgement staying how much my payment will b and that they may issued an ABstract of judgement and that I have to pay 10 percent interest per year while making payments. Does the stipulation of entry of judgement actually gets file with the court or only if I default in payments? I really want to settle out of court and don't want to appear in work.",

        "Normally, a Stipulation for Entry of Judgment provides that a Judgment will be entered only if you default on the payment arrangement or settlement that you agreed to. In other words, let's say the total debt is $5000. And let's say that you agree to pay that amount in installments of $500 over 10 consecutive months. The Stipulation for Entry of Judgment should provide that the case will be dismissed without prejudice. However, the Stipulation should also provide that if you default or don't make the payments, a Judgment will be entered against you for the amount of the debt and, perhaps, attorney fees and costs, as well. With an actual judgment, the interest will run at 10% per years and the creditor can execute -- levy bank accounts, garnish wages, lien property etc. If you have any other questions, you should have an attorney review the terms of the Stipulation before you sign. Good luck !!",

        "Yes, the Entry of Judgment will most likely be filed immediately so that if you default on the payment arrangements they will not have to sue you again, instead, they can just start executing on the judgment. You might want to consult with an attorney since Creditors Attorneys (god bless them) have in the past put terms that were not agreed to in those entries to try and pull a fast one (not alleging that this one will). If you have read the Entry of Judgment and you are CERTAIN that the terms, including the interest, are what you agreed to pay, and you are sure that you will be able to make those payments on time, then signing the Entry of Judgment might be the only way to get the law firm to agree not to proceed against you under the Judgment. Keep in mind, if you have any valid defenses to the debt you will waive those by signing the Entry. You might want to ask the Law Firm for a payment schedule. I am dealing with a case against a law firm in Michigan that did something similar with our client and didn't tell the client that interest was accruing at a rate faster than they payments were being made. Therefore, every payment they made they ended up owing more money each month. It was absurd and I am going to slap that firm with a nice shiny lawsuit. Make sure you understand everything before you sign it. Good Luck!",
        "First of all, it's highly advisable that you refrain from signing any such document without first having it reviewed by your own attorney. Secondly, based on the limited information you have provided in your post, the stipulation will actually get filed with the court once it is signed by all necessary parties."

    "title": "Lawsuit question - dismissing defendant",
    "question": "The 'employer/principal' defaulted (did not and, according to their attorney, will not ever respond to our pleading). The remaining defendant ('employee/agent') did respond. However, he has NO money (filed for bankruptcy). We were advised that since he has nothing to go after, we should dismiss the employee/agent, file for default entry against the employer/principal, and then motion for default judgment, holding the employer 'vicariously liable' for its employee's torts. What's your opinion? Any obvious negatives to doing this?",
    "answers": [
        "If the employee in fact already filed bankruptcy, then you should dismiss the employee forthwith as it would violate the stay if you sued post-bankruptcy filing..and if filed before , dismiss also if discharge received.\n\nWhy not obtain a judgment against the employer if possible by default. Then bring employer in on supplemental proceedings to see what assets are owned, bank accounts, etc. and or garnish. Good luck.",
        "Mr. Granvold has provided a complete answer to your inquiry. I suggest you proceed accordingly.",
        "Agree with Attorney Granvold. Dismiss as to employee who filed bankruptcy and go after the employer. Strongly urge you to retain counsel."

    "title": "As a co-signer to a non-family member, Is a debt owed to a bail bonds company considered consumer Debt or non consumer debt?",
    "question": "I am the co-signer on a $100,000 bond for a neighbor who has now skipped town and has been a fugitive for 8 months. I am now considering bankruptcy and trying to determine whether I need to pass a means test for chapter 7. As I understand it, if the debt is primarily non-consumer debt, the means test is not applicable. Is the debt owed to the bond company consumer debt or non-consumer debt? I cannot find a clear answer to this.",

        "I believe this is a non consumer debt.\n\nA consumer debt is one incurred for personal, family or household use.\n\nA bail bond for someone unrelated and outside of your household should not be considered a consumer obligation. But this is an opinion, not a guarantee!\n\nWe get a lot questions concerning liability on co signed bail bonds. It is amazing how many questions we get from people who co-signed a bond that went bad. I wish everyone would keep in mind that the reason a borrower needs a co-signer is because the lender does not trust the other party to pay the loan!"

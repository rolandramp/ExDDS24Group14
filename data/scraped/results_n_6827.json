    "question": "We live in California where maximum probate fees are based on the size of the estate. We have a $500,000 house and $400,000 in a bank. Both, however, are owned Joint Tenancy. Does this mean they are NOT included in determining the size of our estate for the purpose of calculating maximum probate fees?",

        "I agree with the attorneys above. Owning property as joint tenants may help you avoid probate upon the passing of one owner but when the second owner passes, the full property will need to pass through probate. Ultimately, once the the surviving joint tenant passes, the assets in his estate will be subject to probate.\n\nAs a probate and estate planning attorney in Irvine, I have seen simple estates go through probate because of ineffective planning and it's just not worth it timewise. The minimum amount of time it would take to finalize a probate is 6 months, often taking much longer. There are also a lot of fees incurred.\n\nFor a probate estate valued at $900,000, the maximum probate attorney's fees alone is $14,000. In addition to that, the estate will have to cover fees for the inventory and appraisal of the assets, any required bonds and court filing fees. The cost of creating an effective estate plan with a professional is within the range of court filing fees alone. Also important to note is that in valuing the probate estate, debts are not considered. For example, if your home is worth $500,000 and you still have a $200,000 mortgage, the home will still be valued at $500,000. That is why financially, it is a good idea to effectively avoid probate and meet with an experienced attorney to create an effective estate plan.\n\nIn addition to the financial aspects of an estate plan, a thorough estate plan will also account for your future medical needs as well.\n\nI concur with the sound advice of all three attorneys above, Ms. Brewer, Mr. Rossmeissl and Mr. Fromm.

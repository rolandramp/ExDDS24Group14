        "In addition to the responses from the other attorneys, while it is not a license issue, I strongly recommend that you incorporate your business if you have not already. If you contract as a sole proprietor you are subjecting all of your personal assets to unlimited liability for business debts and obligations. I once represented a wallpaper hanger who was being sued for mold. I suppose the plaintiff's position was that a roof leak that soaked the wallpaper would not have resulted in mold except for the wallpaper. Yes it's ridiculous, but also a good reminder that frivolous lawsuits can and do happen and you need to protect yourself.",
        "I agree with my colleague. Here are some things to consider when deciding what licenses you need:\n\n1. Get a license for things that you MIGHT do. It is better to have a license and not need it, than to go into a project unlicensed and risk your career and professional reputation for a few hundred dollars.\n\n2. Make sure you have all of your tax information filed with all of the proper agencies. Remember: the IRS, the state, county, and city all have an interest in your business (and the money it makes) so make sure you take time to understand what needs to be filed with the taxing bodies because they typically have the steepest penalties.\n\n3. As for the CCIDC, you may not be required to have this license, but you should seriously consider it. The CCIDC administers the law for interior design professionals, so you need to familiarize yourself with their rules and regulations, and having CCIDC license will give you the opportunity to read up on the standards you will be held to and get a certification out of it that you can use in your marketing! I know plenty of interior design professionals that do not mention if they are licensed, so using the CCIDC license in marketing materials can pay for itself if you use it correctly.\n\n4. Starting a business is the best time to set a solid legal foundation for your business you can build upon. If you cut corners when you are establishing your business, it is likely those holes will remain and end yup swallowing your business when you least expect it.\n\nGet all the licenses you need to get and then go and rack up some clients! Good luck to you!",
        "Depending on the services you provide, you may need a contractor's license. Most interior designers need one. Don't believe me? Consult the state contractor's website. You may also need a tax ID, reseller's permit, and other business licenses and/or filings depending on your business entity. I strongly suggest you consult a local attorney to assist you.

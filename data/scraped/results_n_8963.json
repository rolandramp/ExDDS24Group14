        "If there were a payable on death provision the money in the account would pass outside of probate. However, since you are using the affadavit there must not be a POD. Then the account is part of the probate estate and can be used to satisfy debts. Whether the bank can directly net the amounts is questionable. They would need something in the agreement for the Visa account that allows them to do this. Ask them to show you there authority for directly netting the amounts.\n\nAny individual seeking legal advice for their own situation should retain their own legal counsel as this response provides information that is general in nature and not specific to any person's unique situation.

        "Section 13100 of the probate code (which creates the ability to collect a small estate by affidavit) provides that you only have the right to collect the property if \"no other person has a superior right to the interest of the decedent in the described property\". A creditor's claim (for the Visa account, for example) would be a \"superior right\". Therefore, the bank was well within its rights to collect the outstanding balance.\n\nThe information you obtain at this site is not, nor is it intended to be, legal advice.

        "I believe the prior answer that was posted is correct and any assets you inherited from your mother are subject to her creditor's claims. There have been a number of cases where banks collected a decedent's credit card debt directly from a checking or savings account held at the same bank. I have never had a reason to research this, but it is possible that the credit card agreement or the checking account agreement your mother signed specifically allows the bank to do this.",
        "If you are the sole heir of your mother, then any assets you receive without opening up formal probate are obtained subject to the claims of creditors. Thus, by accepting the funds from your mother's bank account, you would have been subject to the claims by the bank on the Visa and any other debts that she had. That is why we have probate, to marshal the assets of the decedent's estate and pay all their just debts, then disburse the remainder to the rightful heirs.\n\nThe law allows certain small estates to have the assets transferred without a formal probate, but those creditors can then claim the heirs are the assignees of the debt, by virtue of receiving the estate's assets. Thus, had the bank released the funds to you, it could have filed suit against you, rather than just pay off the credit card."

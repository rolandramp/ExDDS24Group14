        "Yes, you should list the debt to the casino. As my colleagues stated, you are required to list all debts.

        "The prior answer is correct. You must list all debts as required by law. When you sign the petition you are swearing and affirming that you have disclosured all liabilities and assets.

        "You have to list all debts in your schedules and statement of financial affairs. You also have to list any payments to creditors within the last 90 days on your statement of financial affairs."

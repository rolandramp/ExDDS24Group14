        "The answers from both of my colleagues are correct. It may be instructive to understand that California law requires Declarations of full financial disclosure to be served by each party on the other.\n\nThe law specifically requires (Family Code § 2103) “... each party to a proceeding for dissolution of the marriage or legal separation of the parties shall serve on the other party a preliminary declaration of disclosure ...” (“shall” means must)\n\nEach party must first serve a “Preliminary declaration of disclosure” and “... the parties shall file proof of service of the preliminary declaration of disclosure with the court.” (The proof of service is a form that explains in detail specifically how the document(s) were served (delivered according to the rules) on the other party.)\n\nThe law also requires a “Final declaration of disclosure”, (there is a way to agree to waive that requirement, but the parties must comply with the requirements outlined in the Family Code Sections 2102, 2104 et. sec.)\n\nOnce the foregoing is complete, the parties must file Form No.FL-141 “Declaration Regarding Service of Declaration of Disclosure” which basically confirms to the court that you have satisfied ALL the procedural requirements. Therefore, after you have served the financial documents on your spouse including the Income & Expense Declaration, Property Declaration and/or Schedule of Assets and Debts, filed your proof of service for both the Preliminary and Final Declaration of Disclosure, you complete FL-141.\n\nStill confused?

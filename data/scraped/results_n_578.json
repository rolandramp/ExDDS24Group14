    "title": "No Unity in Bankruptcy? All attorneys should say same thing but they don't",
    "question": "What method does Modesto use to find out the value of a vehicle? Private or trade in because I am getting two different stories. I don't think getting the cheapest attorney is the best idea if he doesn't know what he is doing. Another issue, one said you have to file a motion if it brings down the price of what is owed on the vehicle and the other said he was just going to add it to the repayment plan. I got three different consultations and I need to pick one soon, whom is right? It's for a chapt 13 and I need to pick on soon",
    "answers": [
        "It depends on how aggressive your attorney wants to be. If you are looking to \"cramdown\" the vehicle in Chapter 13, you can start with any value you want. However, value may be objected to by creditor. This is common in Chapter 13 \"Cramdowns.\" The objective is to provide the court with \"evidence\" and \"proof\" of valuation. This is subjective depending on your sources. Court will generally look towards Kelly Blue Book for valuation, but there could be other mitigating factors that determine the value to be other than what is stated in KBB. Your attorney can file a Motion to Determine Value under Title 11 USC ยง506(a). Not every attorney has the same opinion regarding their cases. This is why matter are brought before a court and why issues are argued in front of a Judge. Judge will weigh evidence presented by both parties to determine what is fair and reasonable. If all opinions were united, there would be less litigation before the courts. This is simply not the case. Doesn't work that way.",
        "Here is a good idea. Go get your vehicle appraised at CarMax. Then tell the attorney to propose that value in the plan. That way you eliminate your concern about lack of unity.",
        "The value of any asset can only be truly determined by an actual market-value sale. Since we are trying to determine what that might be without actually having a sale, for different asset different sources are used.\n\nThe standard \"starting point\" for the value of a vehicle is the Kelly Blue Book. In a chapter 7, we refer first to the \"private party\" sale value. In a chapter 13, if the value is being determined for the purposes of paying a secured creditor less than the full balance (when allowed) then we refer first to the Retail value.\n\nUltimately, as noted by others, various evidence can be used when needed to determine value, such as appraisals, offers to buy, etc.\n\nWhy you get different answers about value may depend on what the purpose of the valuation is going to be used for.",
        "As indicated, it depends upon what the valuation is for. Generally in a 13 you have to look at the price a similar car could be purchased from a willing seller. In a chapter 7, you have to look at what what price your car could be sold. In neither case is it going to be a trade in value.\nSince you are discussing filing a motion, I am assuming you are talking chapter 13, in which case a motion must be filed if you are trying to value the car to cram down the debt in the plan. If you do not intend to do a cram down, then a motion isn't necessary.\nOn the off chance you are talking about a 7 and doing a redemption motion, (paying the current fair market value in full) you are going to be looking at the price to purchase the car. If that is the case, you should be talking to you attorney about the financing that may be available to do so.\nIf you aren't comfortable with the attorney to whom you've talked, looks around for an experienced bankruptcy attorney with whom you are comfortable.\n\nGood Luck",
        "The law allows a judge to consider all types of evidence in determining the value of a vehicle. Kelly Blue Book is evidence of value but the law does not require use of Kelly Blue Book. You might suggest Kelly Blue Book - Private Party as the best and fairest way to ascertain the value of your vehicle and a judge might agree. One lawyer suggesting KBB Trade-In value while another thinks Private Party does not make either of them correct nor does it make them wrong. Ultimately, it is a judge that decides. In terms of filing a motion to lower the value, there are limitations related to how and when that can be done. At this point, I think you need to ask more questions about why one wants to do this or that. Hope this helps.",
        "I suggest that you not hesitate to consult several or more other lawyers. You will find there are big differences between lawyers in what they know, what they charge, and their level of friendliness. Here is what I can tell you about valuing the car.\n\nThe method to value the car depends on the purpose of the valuation. Different purposes require different valuation methods. Here is why that is:\n\nThe Supreme Court says that the method of valuation for a Chapter 13 debtor doing a cramdown is the price that you would have to pay to buy the same vehicle. Thus, it is a retail value.\n\nWhen a liquidating trustee in a Chapter 7 case is evaluating whether to sell your car, the trustee looks at the value that would be paid on the spot by a car dealer, which is much less than retail.",

    "title": "Bank failed to comply with sheriff's levy order. What are my options?",
    "question": "I won a $10,000 judgment in small claims court that I'm attempting to collect. A few months ago, I had the sheriff's dept. levy the debtor's bank account. The memorandum of garnishee I received stated that $10,000 was in the account. The bank only turned over $3,000 of the judgment to the sheriff and returned the rest to the debtor. The sheriff then sent an order to comply, which the bank disregarded. The bank now says it's powerless to do anything because the funds have been returned to the debtor.",

        "If you are confused or frustrated by the process, it is not surprising because it is not easy or simple to collect a judgment. Your best bet is to turn it over to a collection lawyer who knows the process thoroughly. Most of them handle cases on a contingency fee so it doesn't cost you anything up front."

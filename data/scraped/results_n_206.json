    "question": "1.My husband has a lots of cc bills and I’m concerned if he can keep up with them. All the cards are on his name only and we file our taxes separately. If he doesn’t pay them will I be responsible for them and if he files a bankruptcy am I forced to file a bankruptcy as well.",

    "answers": [
        "As long as you did not co-sign on his credit cards or sign any papers concerning his hospital services then he can just file bankruptcy and his bankruptcy discharge will likely eliminate his credit cards debts and medical bills.\n\nHis bankruptcy discharge will also prevent his creditors from pursuing the community property you have with him, such as things you acquired while married and living in California with him (i.e. bank accounts, real estate, etc...).\n\nIt is best you and your husband discuss your financial circumstances with an experienced bankruptcy attorney.",
        "No, you don’t have to file. Community debts will be discharged by his filing.",
        "Atty Marcus is correct, and I add the following: If your name appears on a money judgment obtained by a medical creditor you must have been served notice of the lawsuit. Go on the court's website, enter the case number and review the court docket. You are looking for a Declaration re Proof of Service. Print that document and set up a consultation with an Avvo lawyer offering a free phone consultation. That will tell you what action you should take to vacate an improper judgment having been taken against you. If the Proof of Service is bogus, that may be your ticket out of this mess. Good luck & God bless.",
        "You are not specifically responsible for his debts, but community property assets are. If he does not pay the debts, creditors can sue him and recover from any assets he has, which includes any community assets, which includes marital income, and property acquired after the marriage (bank accounts, real estate, etc.).\n\nIf he files bankruptcy and receives a discharge of his debts, the \"community discharge\" provisions of the Bankruptcy Code will protect any community assets as long as you remain married."

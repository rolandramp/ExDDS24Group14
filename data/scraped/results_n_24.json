    "title": "What are the chances of forcing a sale of real property (homestead) to get payment of judgment? How might that work?",
    "question": "Is there ever a scenario where you can force the sale of a property? In my case, there is a judgment award (from divorce) but also a personal loan that I will have to sue to get another judgment. The total amount is 200K. What are the other options, besides liens, to try to retrieve this money?",

        "The state of California has laws which are designed to attempt to prevent the ability of a creditor to foreclose based on a debt. The chances are not zero but they are not good either. You need to know what the equity in the home is, because there’s an automatic homestead exemption in the state of California. Again, the purpose of this law is to prevent dollars from for closing on peoples homes.",
        "A judgment can be recorded as a lien on the property. As a result of that recorded lien, you can consider a judicial foreclosure - which is a court action. Since you did not sue for the personal loan, you would have to file a lawsuit for that loan and get a judgment - and then record it on the property. With judgments, you can also levy on bank accounts; conduct a judgment debtor exam to locate assets and which creates a lien on personal property. I suggest you consult directly with a collection or litigation attorney about these options."

        "I agree with previous attorneys. You future income is generally not the property of the bankruptcy estate in Chapter 7 (with certain exceptions) and you are free to dispose of the exempt assets. Your question is not detailed enough, however, to be able to provide you with the full answer. You definitely need help to fix the issues (likely amend schedules and have trustee abandon any rights in the future income arising out of the script sale if it is not worth much, that is unless you already have a contract for the script sale and trustee is aware of that).",
        "What is your screenplay worth right now, without being finished? The Chapter 7 Trustee isn't entitled to take work you do in the future to pay the creditors, nor is the Trustee entitled to prevent you from selling property that is otherwise exempt.\n\nMy concern is that if you filed your bankruptcy without an attorney representing you, you have already shot yourself in the foot. Hopefully, the volunteer lawyers in your community will be able to straighten things out for you.\n\nHope this perspective helps!",
        "More likely than not, the items you mentioned that you would like to sell are exempt. However, I agree with the other attorney that you need a qualified attorney to review your schedules to make sure you properly exempted the assets. If they are fully exempt the Trustee would likely not have a problem with you selling to earn money and make ends meet, as those assets would be abandoned by the estate.",
        "The idea of bankruptcy is to give a debtor a fresh start.

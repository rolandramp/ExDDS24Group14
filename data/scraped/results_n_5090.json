    "title": "My credit report says my wife's student loan debt was discharged in our bankruptcy two years ago. Is this possible?",
    "question": "My wife took out a private student loan to an unaccredited hair school about 5 years ago. When we declared Chapter 7 bankruptcy (no asset) two years ago our lawyer told us private student loans couldn't be discharged. We have continued to make payments through our bank's autopay the last two years, but when I recently checked all of our credit reports, they all had the debt listed as discharged. I checked online with Salle Mae and their site couldn't find a loan for us and the bankruptcy lawyer won't call me back. Is it possible the loan was discharged? If so, would I be able to get a refund from Salle Mae for all money paid after the bankruptcy (nearly $5000)?",

        "There is the possibility that they were discharged. While the code technically makes \"student loans\" undischargable, the rule is fairly long and subject to some wiggle room. To be nondischargable, it basically has to be a qualified loan, given to a qualified student, who is attending a qualified institution. If any of these Fails, theres an argument that the loan is not a \"student loan\" subject to non-discharge. It's worth your time to find somebody to do a little investigating. You probably won't get the money you've paid in back, though, as they soy d like you've been making voluntary payments, but if its dischargable then you save yourself a few hundred bucks a month.",
        "Possibly. If it is an unaccredited school there is a good chance that it is not an eligible educational institution for the purposes of the nondischargeability provision of 523(a)(8). Eligible institutions are defined as institutions that are eligible to participate in the Title IV federal financial assistance programs. Small unaccredited voc/tech schools that go in and out of business typically are not eligible to participate.\n\nI think it is worth speaking to another attorney about. Try to find someone who has more experience with student loan debt.",
        "A credit report is not a legal document & isn't proof of anything. Sorry to have to dash your hopes. You can check the court website to see if a special order was granted discharging your student loan, but I think your wife would have remembered showing evidence that she could not work and paying the substantial additional fee to the bankruptcy attorney for taking this to court. Hope this perspective helps!",
        "A credit report showing a creditor charged off an account is not the same as not owing the debt. Generally, student loans are not discharged in BK absent some special circumstances. Forget about the refund, but stop making payments and see what happens.",
        "No, the debt was not discharged in your wife's bankruptcy. You are not the first person to ask this question, it comes up frequently. First, keep in mind, your credit report is NOT a legal document. A debtor is required to list ALL debts on her bankruptcy petition. The bankruptcy code sorts out what debts are and are not discharged. When it comes to credit reporting, as a matter of practice, student loan servicers will note that the debt was included in bankruptcy on a debtor's credit report. However, that DOES NOT mean the debt was actually discharged."

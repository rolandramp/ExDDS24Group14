    "title": "Can I get sued for medical debts?",
    "question": "I have medical debts racked up from a car accident in Sept 2009. I had no medical insurance at the time and the auto insurance claimed the accident was my fault. The medical debt is with a collection company and the rep said that I either have to come up with the entire amount at once, they have \"started\" the judgement process and the only other way to stop it from being filed would be to make $500 payments for the next 14 months, starting next week or else. I can't afford that in anyway shape or form. Can they sue me for the medical debt? and can this turn into my wages being garnished? what can I do?",

        "Yes, I have represented consumers being sued by physicians and hospitals on unpaid medical bills. I caution consumers AGAINST making any payments, unless they are sure that that they can complete the terms agreed. Otherwise, I don't think it wise to start a payment program now, then be unable to complete it, which may make the problem worse for you. There are statutes of limitation for a debt, and your making a payment will revive the statute of limitations, which discuss in my blog, in the first link, below.\n\nPlease also see my three legal guides on Avvo on settling debts and negotiating them. I have the first of this series in the second link, below. If the medical provider or debt collector sues you, you will need to retain an attorney if you cannot afford to settle it, otherwise they can get a wage garnishment, if they succeed in getting a judgment from the court. It will be more costly that way for you, as the judgment would probably be the full amount, plus interest, court costs, and attorney's fees.\n\nRobert Stempler (please see DISCLAIMER below)\nwww.StopCollectionLawsuits.com",
        "My experience is that medical providers tend to use extremely aggressive collectors and actually follow through on their threats to sue.

        "Medical providers often have to sue to get paid, and they usually sue by transferring the claim over to a collection agent of some sort.

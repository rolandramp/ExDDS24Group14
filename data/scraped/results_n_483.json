        "No matter what direction you take, you are going to have to litigate the accounting on this loan and have a court make that decision. The terms of the Note will control, along with California Real Property law.\nI suggest first consulting with an attorney that handles mortgage litigation. Again, no matter what, I expect that this will be an expensive process. In some instances, a state court will stay (stop) the foreclosure to determine what the balance owed is. You will then have to pay it in a lump sum, since the loan is due.\nJust as a supposition and without knowing anything whatsoever about your loan, what if there was a $1,000 per month late penalty, plus interes, since the loan came due? If you paid $400 per month, $600 a month plus unpaid interest would have accrued for many years. The loan balance of $58,000 could easily be correct.\n\nAnother option is to file a case under chapter 13, but for non-residential property, the court may not allow you to pay the balance over time. You would still have to litigate that balance, again at a high cost. Paying this off over the maximum 60 months would still be $1,000 per month. The creditor might also be entitled to interest.\n\nGo talk to a real estate litigation attorney and find out if they can help and what the cost would be. Then you have to decide whether that is a less costly option than just getting a loan and paying off the demand of the creditor."

    "title": "I got this letter from this collection firm Franklin Collection Service, NC for AT&T again after wrote them and told them that",
    "question": "I could not pay the bill of $1, 928.09 because my only income was SSI and they sent another notice advising me that AT&T may authorize a law firm to file a civil lawsuit against me. The collection agency firm will not listen to me, now what am I going to do. Even if they sue me they cannot get the money from me, because I only get 545.10 a month and they want the whole amount now.",

        "If you send letter 1.1 from my web site (see link, below) within 30 days of receipt of a debt collector's initial communication letter/notice, they must verify the debt to you in writing, before they may continue to collect (such as calls or a lawsuit). If you are past the 30 days from date of receipt of their initial letter, then send letter 1.2, which the Fair Debt Collection Act will require them to stop calling you on the debt. Oral requests for verification of the debt are not enforceable in court, so they usually refuse to do it by phone.\n\nYou may need to hire a debt collection defense attorney, if they sue you in a debt collection lawsuit. When was the last time you paid the bill to AT&T? If it has been more than two years, the debt may be unenforceable in court. Do you have any bank records showing your last payments or copies of the last few bills from AT&T? A lawsuit against you can be a real hassle, as they can try to seize your bank account to try to get funds that are not exempt, which your SSI is exempt. The can also require you to appear in court and state under oath your income, assets, and other financial information. Ignoring this will not make it go away or get better.",

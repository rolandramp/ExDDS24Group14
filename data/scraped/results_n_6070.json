    "title": "What about fee-only Chapter 13 bankruptcy?",
    "question": "As stated before, I cannot afford to pay upfront costs to a lawyer or court in order to file bankruptcy. I passed the Means test for Chapter 7. I am inundated with creditors calling and telling me they will be \"serving\" me and \"summoning\" me to appear, that I am being charged with \"fraud\" for failure to pay. Is there a fee-only Chapter 13 in California? and are many lawyers willing to handle this type of case? Thank you.",

        "You may not qualify for a Chapter 13 plan because it might not be feasible to make monthly plan payments to your creditors. If you believe you qualify for a Chapter 7 liquidation, the attorney fees should not be holding you back. For example, why not pay your Chapter 7 attorney $300/month until the fees are paid in full allowing you to file a Chapter 7 and liquidate your debt. Attorney fees for a Chapter 7 average around $1500. This would likely be more beneficial to you than paying the same $300/month to the Chapter 13 trustee for a minimum of 36 months ($10,800).\nAlso, once you retain a bankruptcy attorney, you can deflect all your collection calls onto the firm. Creditors should not be threatening you with fraud for non-payment but there are many unscrupulous collectors out there that an experience bankruptcy attorney can deal with on your behalf. Bottom line, seek a free consultation today before the threats of lawsuits become a reality.",
        "I see you are in Marina, so I can tell you that our local bankruptcy court (San Jose Division) does approve Chapter 13 plans in which only the trustee and the attorney are getting paid through the plan. Your situation might be workable in this area.",
        "I wonder if you really cannot afford to pay legal fees to an attorney, whether chapter 13 is feasible option for you. I'm saying this because under chapter 13, the debtor must have regular income and the ability to make regular chapter 13 plan payments. Perhaps you are thinking of chapter 7?",
        "I agree with Ms. Dowe. You need to sit down with an attorney to explore you options. Trying to figure them out from answers to questions here on Avvo will not get you the answers you need because there are other issues which need to be explored. I think it will be very hard to find an attorney willing to help you file a fee-only Chapter 13.",
        "Have you actually sat down whit an attorney and explore ways of paying the attorney's fees? If you file a Chapter 13 just because you believe you can not pay the up front fees are you going to be able to keep up with your monthly fees to the trustee? I can see your Chapter 13 case getting dismissed because you did not make your plan payments and you will be right back where you are today. Most courts frown upon Fees only Chapter 13 cases.",

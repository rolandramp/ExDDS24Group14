    "title": "How do I dispute the dollar amount of a creditors claim in Chapter 7 non-asset adversay?",
    "question": "I'm in a chapter 7 adversary. Not surprisingly, this one particular creditor filed an adversary. The trustee has already filed his recommendation for discharge. My bankruptcy is a no-asset chapter 7 so this creditor did not have to file a proof of claim. I have documents to back up my assertion that their claim is fraudulent. I put this creditor on my petition, but with no amount (amount unknown) because I knew this very litigious person would try and block my discharge. I need to know how to make this creditor validate/substantiate the dollar amount of their claim (instead of just filing a complaint and trying to block my discharge) so that the court knows what's going on. Something like this can go all the way to trial if I don't do something about it now.",

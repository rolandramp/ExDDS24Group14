    "title": "Collecting on an unpaid promissory note for $36,000",
    "question": "Why are chances of collecting on a signed/notorized promissory note \"slim\"? I loaned someone $36,000 from my personal savings and thought I was protecting myself by getting a promissory note executed. Are you saying that it is a worthless piece of paper? I don't have funds now to hire an attorney, so are you saying that I'm just flat out of luck?",

        "Note that I am not licensed to practice in your state.\n\nHaving a promissory note is not worthless. Whether you can actually collect on the note depends on several factors. It depends on whether you can find the person you loaned money to; it depends on whether that person has any money to repay you; and it also depends on whether you can secure the note.\n\nThe promissory note is evidence of an unsecured debt (just like a credit card). If you want to secure it, say put a lien on the person's house, you need to sue the person, get a judgment and then place the lien on the home. When that person eventually goes to sell the home, then you can collect from the proceeds of the sale."

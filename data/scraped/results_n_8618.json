    "question": "My bankruptcy was discharged earlier this year. I didn't reaffirm my mortgage (first and second) but still pay after. Now I was 2 months late for the second loan (an heloc) and their debt collector keep on calling me. They told me that once discharged they can call me and try to collect. What can I do ? Can I sue them ?",

        "No debt collector or creditor may contact you after the discharge, except under limited circumstances for certain purposes. Your posting says \"still pay after.\" What do you mean by that comment? Are you still in the home and making payments on the mortgage, which was not discharged? Are you current with your home mortgage? Did the first mortgage or HELOC obtain relief from the automatic stay? What does the debt collector say when calling you?\n\nIf they are contacting you illegally after the discharge (which I need more facts, as stated above), then you would be able to pursue them in an adversarial proceeding in bankruptcy court for their violations of the discharge order and any collection harassment claims.",
        "Were the mortgages listed in your bankruptcy petition? assuming so, if you did not reaffirm on the mortgages in your bankruptcy, then the underlying debts would have been discharged. What that means is that the creditors cannot pursue you for any money; however they still can foreclose on the property which would be their sole recourse. you should send your creditors a letter providing your bankruptcy discharge as well as your Schedule A showing that they were listed as creditors. If they persist in calling you, they will be violating federal law and there are penalties for that."

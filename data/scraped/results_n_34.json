    "title": "How can I build my case in an Appeal against a gov agency when they refuse to provide documentation to prove I owe them money?",
    "question": "I filed a unemployment claim in 2008. The EDD says they paid me over $20,000 and then decided I wasn't entitled to it and filed a court order for me to repay it in November 2020. The claim was over 13 years ago. I know I did not receive benefit payments in that amount, but they refuse to provide me with documentation on actual payouts between 2008-2009 or any other accounting to prove I owe them the money. They are threatening me with wage garnishment of $400 a month. I have filed an appeal with the CUIAB. I may not be able to prove my case if they don't provide me documentation. Is this legal what they are doing to me?",

        "You are in over your head on this. As stated by atty Bunce, the time to obtain evidence may have passed. When you were originally sued by EDD, you or your attorney are expected to engage in discovery. Discovery consists of demanding documents, answers to your questions about the EDD allegations, etc. If you or your attorney failed to demand documents, etc, you won't be able to prove your case. An appeal of your adverse decision does not provide for you to seek discovery now. Sorry, it doesn't look good for you.",
        "Procedure is everything. If you followed the proper process to ask for the missing records regarding claims that were paid by the EDD, then you could win simply based on this violation. If you didn't follow the proper process to obtain the records, you have no argument. Go through the information about this process, often referred to as discovery. Unfortunately, this is an argument that should have been raised before you reached the appeal stage, and you may be too late to undo this mistake. Hope this perspective helps!"

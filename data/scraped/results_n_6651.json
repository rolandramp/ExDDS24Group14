    "question": "Hello, I've been trying to look for an answer. I filed chapter7 bankruptcy and my house was included in it. My bankruptcy was discharged in 2010 but the foreclosure was not completed until Nov 2011 My question is, why do the banks have to wait for the seasoning date of foreclosure when the house was included in the bankruptcy and was included in the discharged debts?",

        "I'll hazard a guess about what you mean by the \"seasoning date\". I'll assume that you are interested in obtaining a home loan sometime in the future. Banks/lenders and the agencies that insure home loans have different rules about how long you must wait if there is a bankruptcy filing in your credit history and how long you must wait if there is a foreclosure sale in your credit history. Your best bet is to check with an experienced mortgage broker for all the guideline lending rules that are currently in effect. Bear in mind that these rules are subject to change and often do change. In the mean time, you should focus on building up your credit score through the use of credit so that you will be in a good position to obtain a home loan once enough time has passed since your bankruptcy case filing and/or the foreclosure sale. I hope this answer helps.\nGood luck!"

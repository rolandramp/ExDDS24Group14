    "title": "If I leave my husband am I still entitled to half of everything we accumulated over the marriage?",
    "question": "I am leaving my husband of 26 years. He has worked only 7 months out of the last three years. He drinks and was verbally abusive through out our whole marriage. We own our own home. I will have to be the one to move out, he said he is not going anywhere, and he said he will not give me a divorce. I want to know what steps I should take. Thank you for your time.",

        "He has no choice to not give you a divorce. If you file for divorce as Petitioner, whether he participates or not, you will be granted a divorce. You should speak to a family law attorney in your area. I hope though that your husband gets into a good impatient program and is able to defeat the disease of addiction. Not to put additional burden on you, but I suggest clients of mine in your situation to go to Alanon meetings to better prepare for the process of dealing with an alcoholic.",
        "The good news is you are entitled to half of the community property. The tough thing is going to be how is he going to pay for your spousal support if he is no working more than two months per year. Maybe you should sell the house and get half of the proceeds from the equity of the house and get yourself an apartment. I suggest you get yourself an attorney. Best of luck.",
        "I would echo everything that has been said by the other attorneys. In addition, you can go to the Sonoma County Family Court web page, and read the various items of information about filing for divorce, as well as related issues. Here's the link: http://sonoma.courts.ca.gov/divisions/family\n\nAlso, please note that there is more than one way to go through the divorce process. In other words, you can try mediation or collaborative law, rather than litigation. Of course, your husband would have to agree to such other methods. However, once he realizes that he can't stop the divorce, perhaps he will decide to act in his own best interests, and avoid litigation, because if he doesn't, he may be exposed to pay your attorney fees.",

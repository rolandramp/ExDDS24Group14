    "title": "I went to the Labor commission because my employer didn't pay me, and won my case. What do I do now?",
    "question": "My previous employer did not pay it's employees then abruptly closed up shop. I was the first the file with the Labor Commission & already had my hearing. I received a letter from the Labor Commission stating that my previous employer owes me nearly $7,000. I was told that just because I was \"awarded\" that amount does not necessarily mean my employer will pay it. I was planning to go to small claims court since I know many others are working with the Labor Commission and will also be getting money awarded to them, but my employer is doing what ever they can not to pay. The family who ran the business owns several other businesses but each one is in a different name so I am not sure whose names to add to the suit. How can I make sure I get the money I am owed?",

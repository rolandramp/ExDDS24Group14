        "Any debt forgiven outside of bankruptcy constitutes income for federal income tax purposes. In other word, if a company you owe $10,000 tells you that you only have to pay back $7,000 to fully satify the obligation, then you have $3,000 federal income for tax purposes from this trasnaction. This is not the case when debts are discharged in bankruptcy.\n\nThese comments are not legal advice and are made for educational purposes only. No attorney-client relationship exists between us.",
        "A \"charge off\" isn't any sort of legal change in your obligation to pay. All the term means is that the creditor moves the debt to the \"bad debt\" collection. Ultimately, most 'charge fofs\" are sold to debt buyers, who then sue you. it may be many years later, I have heard of some that sue 12 years later.\n\nBeware of anything calling itself a \"debt settlement company\".

        "If you discharge the debt in a bankruptcy you will have a Federal Court Order as opposed to whatever you may or may not receive from the debt settlement company. You will also not recieve a 1099 if you discharge the debt in bankruptcy,and there will be no negative tax implications. Therefore, unless you have substantial non-exempt assets, the bankruptcy would be the preferred option. Finally, there is no particular agency that governs debt settlement companies(a problem), so the best you can do is the better business bureau,or state attorney general, and make sure there are no complaints."

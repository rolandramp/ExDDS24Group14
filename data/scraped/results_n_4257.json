    "question": "In a marriage since 95, husband has alcohol/substance issues. We are at a ...he needs to get it together or I am gone point. He has asked if a legal document like this is possible. I also would like to know. Something that says if he does this, this or this...this is what he will agree to do in a divorce case scenario.",

        "The short answer to your question is yes - there is such a thing as a post-nuptial or post-marital agreement, which speaks to how community assets and debts will be divided upon divorce. As the prior responder noted, there are concerns with respect to making such an agreement contingent upon your husband's sobriety, and I would strongly suggest that you meet with an experienced family law attorney to draft your agreement and advise you with respect to the law in this area. You will want to ensure that if things do fall apart, your agreement is in fact enforceable and all contingencies have been addressed.\n\nBest of luck to you.",
        "There are Marital Agreements wherein you can make determination and agreements regarding the characteristic of certain property. However, the court will not uphold agreements that are against public policy. Therefore, issues that are moral in nature (ex: If husband is unfaithful, Wife will get the house). Further, agreements should not be drafting in anticipation of divorce. This does sound counterintuitive (considering the purpose of the agreement would be to avoid divorce) - however, an agreement that specifically states \"if divorce then ...\" will not be upheld by the court. Nevertheless, there are Marital Agreements that you can enter into with your spouse - but, it is definitely in your best interest to discuss your options with an experienced family law attorney who practices in the courthouse wherein you matter may be heard. It also sounds like you may be at the point in your marriage where marital counseling would assist in mending any issues and, hopefully, assist in avoiding a divorce. I am sure this is a very difficult time for you. Good luck to you."

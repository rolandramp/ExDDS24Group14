        "You asked if there were any remedies available to you that wouldn't cost a lot of dollars. The answer, in short is probably not. When you have a judgment, there are limited remedies available. There is a motion to reconsider, motion to set aside and most importantly appeal. All of these options have deadlines associated with them and you could loose all recourse forever if you do not move quickly. I recommend you find a well respected appellate attorney in your area who has experience with family law for a consultation. As part of your consideration, you will want to think about whether, the judgment, as unfair as it is, would be something you could live with when facing the costs and uncertainty of an appeal.

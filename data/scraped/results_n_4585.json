        "“Is a Personal Guarantee for a spouse still valid after Divorce?” -- Yes. Your guarantee is with the entity that loaned your spouse the money. Your divorce does not change that entity's rights against you. Depending on the terms of your judgment of dissolution, you may have a claim for reimbursement or contribution from our ex.

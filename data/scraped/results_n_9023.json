    "title": "Voluntary Deportation due to marriage fraud",
    "question": "I am a US citizen (born and raised in US). My boyfriend, who I am very much in love with, entered into a fraudulant marriage to obtain his greencard before we met. During the interview his spouse revealed that their marriage was fraud. He has a hearing at the end of this month. We have spoken to lawyers and as we understand it he has two options: 1. prove that the marriage was entered into good faith or 2. voluntary departure. We are thinking of going with #2 but what exactly is the process and the limitations of voluntary departure? How long does he have before he must leave? Does voluntary departure trigger a ban? Also, if he were to leave voluntarily would I be able to bring him back on a fiancee visit and how likely would it be granted given his history of marriage fraud?",

        "I think that it is a little more complicated than a waiver. However, I agree that someone should review the situation and at least know to discuss the waiver issue.\n\nFirst, the suggestions mentioned by the writer are risky, where the former wife admitted to marriage fraud under oath. This admission, by the wife, who could have been indicted and convicted for a Federal Crime is quite significant. However, the USCIS has the burden to prove marriage fraud, which does not seem particularly difficult based upon the above.\n\nThe waiver section of the deportation code is thought by many to apply when marriage fraud is committed by a parent, but not directly by an applicant as in this situation.\n\nThis waiver may be presented in immigration court, but only if it can be presented with a good faith argument. Someone can research, candidly discuss the case law, and suggest options. Also, where a client consents and appreciates that the waiver request may lead to an appeal. A few of the San Diego Immigration Judges and Assistant Chief Counsel's may have concerns and challenge the waiver argument. An attorney needs to spend enough time to prepare for the arguments.\n\nIf he leaves with voluntary departure, then it can be quite challenging for him to ever lawfully return for a number of reasons. Yet, more information is needed. You may want to consider all of your options including immigration to his country of birth/citizenship or a neutral third country like Australia.\n\nYou should work with an experienced attorney who is candid about all of your options. This, so that you can decide how to continue this matter with a plan of action that is in your best interests.\n\nThe above is general information and does not create an attorney client relationship.",

    "question": "We found out that the bank has charged it off and that's the reason why they have stopped sending my partner notices. No notices not even phone calls from the bank not until a few weeks ago, she received a notice from the collection agency and demanding full payments. We called the bank and they're willing to negotiate but my partner did not have the money to pay because the Company is already out of business. What do we need to do?",

        "You used the term \"partner\", so I will assume you had (and perhaps still have) a partnership.\n\nYou write that the company is \"out of business\". In your question, you used the term \"dissolved\". Was the partnership, in fact, dissolved from the legal perspective? (Partnership dissolution is discussed in the post at the link below.)\n\nFrom the nature of your question, my guess is that you did not go through a formal dissolution process. In any event, each of you, as a general partner, took on unlimited personal liability for the partnership's obligations.

        "Perhaps I did not understand. You are not thinking about obtaining the loan under false pretenses? The loan was to your or your partner's company, not you or your partner personally, and the company is out of business. If you access the credit line now, there may be a possible claim that the line of credit was to the company, not you. I would avoid it unless the bank is aware that the company is gone and you would be taking the money for your own use.\n\nCharge off means that the bank is following standard accounting practices on debts that are unpaid after a long period of time. They can still sue you or assign it to a debt collector to see if they can get you to pay a reasonable portion of the loan. Debt collectors typically acquire a portfolio of debts for a low percentage, then hope that they can convince people to repay a higher percentage (on average), which is how they turn a profit and cover their costs and expenses. Sometimes they even sue the debtors and either negotiate from there or enforce a judgment against wages, bank accounts, and real estate owned by the debtor.\n\nBe careful about dealing with the bank when a debt collector is involved. Do you know from the notice sent by the collector if they own the debt now or if the bank still owns it? You want to be sure that if you do settle with the bank or the collector, that you get a signed written release of the debt, so no one else claims you still owe it or at least a letter on their letterhead saying that they received your payment and the debt is settled in full. If the debt collector owns the debt, you should deal directly with it, as you may get a more favorable deal. Of course, negotiate for a lower settlement price.",
        "If this was a partnership, then you'll be liable for the company's debts, as well as for your partner's on behalf of the partnership. If this company was a corporation or LLC and you didn't personally guarantee the line of credit, then you have a corporate shield protecting you personally and you may not care if the creditor sues and gets a judgment against the dissolved company.\n\nA \"charge off\" is just an accounting term, and it doesn't mean that the debt has disappeared or that the creditor can't sue for breach (including you and your partner personally if this was a partnership) - they can.\n\nSo step 1 is figure out what kind of company you've got and if you're personally liable. If not, you just let them have a judgment. Step 2, if you're personally liable, see if you've got any defenses to a claim. If you do have defenses, fight the claim, or settle it. If not, step 3 is settle the claim. You may need to hire a business litigator for all of this.\n\nDisclaimer: Please note that this answer does not constitute legal advice, and should not be relied on, since each state has different laws, each situation is fact specific, and it is impossible to evaluate a legal problem without a comprehensive consultation and review of all the facts and documents at issue.

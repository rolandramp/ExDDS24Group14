    "question": "I filed a chapter 13 last year, now I have a home owner's association currently wanting back owed dues. I want to know can I convert my current chapter 13 to a chapter 7?? also if possible can I keep my automobile ?? will a chapter 7 wipe out home owners dues and school loans? and back taxes also?",

        "You may file a motion to convert from Ch. 13 to Ch. 7.\n\nA Ch. 13 can be dismissed by the debtor. If you are in Chapter 7, however, the Trustee is going to hold on to the case until he or she is satisfied that you have no assets, or until non-exempt assets are sold. In other words, it may be a long haul.\n\nWhether or not your car is sold depends on 1) value; 2) outstanding liens; 3) exemptions. Consult your lawyer.\n\nTaxes are only dischargeable if they meet certain conditions.\n\nHOA fees are possibly secured by a lien on your property. If not, they may be dischargeable, but what would discharging them do to your relationship with the HOA? in other words, once the BK is over, what disciplinary or retaliatory action could they take? That may be a subject for an HOA atty.",
        "One can convert from chapter 13 bankruptcy to chapter 7 bankruptcy. The specifics of your case call for careful scrutiny to make sure that is the correct route and option for you to take. There are certain requirements you must meet in order to qualify for chapter 7 bankruptcy.\n\nChapter 7 bankruptcy does not address the past due HOA fees. That is what chapter 13 bankruptcy is generally for. Chapter 7 bankruptcy may discharge some or all of your past tax debt depending on the circumstances with that. You can likely keep your vehicle in chapter 7 bankruptcy, however, student loan debt is something that is generally not dischargeable in bankruptcy.\n\nIt is probably a good idea to team up with an experienced bankruptcy lawyer to help you through this process.\n\nI hope this helps.",
        "Stay in 3 if you want to discharge the HOA dues. Those HOA dues are specifically exempted from discharge in a 7 but ALL HOA dues, even accruing post-petition in a 13, are discharged by Sec. 1328. This is the 9th Cir.'s 2018 ruling in Goudelock v. Sixty-01.",
        "Yes, it's possible to submit a motion to convert a case from Chapter 13 to Chapter 7, assuming you're eligible for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. There's a reason you're in the 13, is that reason no longer valid?

You'll want to speak with your (an?) attorney whether this is a good idea.\n\nYes, many people keep their cars in Chapter 7, as long as they stay current on the payments and reaffirm the debt. But again, car equity exceeding the exemption amount can result in you losing your vehicle(s). You'll want to meet with an attorney before converting to 7, assuming you qualify for it.\n\nThere are many debts that are exceptions to discharge. These are listed on 11 USC 523(a). You'll want to pay attention to subsections (a)(16), (a)(1), and (a)(8).

        "Yes you can convert from a chapter 13 to a chapter 7. The remainder of your questions are fact specific: in other words it depends. How much equity to you have in your vehicle? when did your back taxes accrue? What kind of school loans and what is your budget? Do you still own the house? Has the HOA filed a lien.\nYou would be better off contacting an experienced local bankruptcy attorney to discuss your options before you take further action."

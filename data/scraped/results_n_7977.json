    "title": "I just received a pre-lien notifiaction from my HOA, how do I fight this?",
    "question": "I have lived in this condo since December of 2008, and was paying my fees every month, but in October of 2009, I began to have problems making complete payments and would send out partial or full payments depending on my situation. Yesterday I received a Pre-Lein notification for the past due plus fees I wasnt aware I owed. Such as returned check fees and late fees. I dont recall that these fees were ever on my statements I received monthly. If I would of had the money I would of paid the full balance, but I have come up against some hardships and have been struggling to pay my bills. I am retired and have a fixed income to live off of. What can I do about this situation?",

        "Talk to the HOA. If the HOA has the power file for a lien, maybe you can negotiate with them. Just because you cannot afford the dues, it does not meant that you do not have to pay the entire amount every month. Hardship is not a defense."

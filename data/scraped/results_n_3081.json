    "title": "If we live in 2 different counties, does it matter where we file for a divorce?",
    "question": "Hi! I live in San Joaquin county and my husband lives in Alameda county. I want to file for a divorce through a Family Law Facilitator does it matter where I file? Do I need to start the process in my own county? I want to do it the right way but not sure where to start. Money is very tight and can't afford the services of a paralegal or an attorney. We don't own anything, no kids, no properties, no assets, it's an amicable divorce. Please help! Thank you in advance!",

        "You must be a resident in your county for at least 3 months prior to filing in that county. And you must have been a resident in CA for at least 6 months prior to filing. If you meet these conditions, then you can file in San Joaquin county. Use the self help services at your nearest superior court location.",
        "Gregory is absolutely correct on this issue. You can file in your county if you have lived there fore the past 3 months and the State of California for the past 6 months.",
        "As long as you have satisfied the residency requirements in your county, you can file there. The prior attorney that answered nailed that for you. If you are both in agreement and you have been married less than five years, have no kids and virtually no assets or debts to divide, then you may want to file a Summary Dissolution (where both parties sign the paperwork to dissolve the marriage together). This is less time consuming, cheaper and faster than a standard dissolution of marriage. Depending on your income level, you may qualify for a waiver of filing fees too--ask the facilitator's office about a fee waiver application when you go to file.\n\nAs for citizenship issues, you will want to call your local County Bar Association for referrals to Immigration Attorneys in your area. They can help you determine what risk you may have regarding residency/citizenship status specific to the facts of your case. Since you are not yet divorced, you may want to wait on filing your divorce until your immigration status is finalized. Again, this will depend upon the facts of your case and you will want to talk to an immigration expert/attorney to determine you best plan of action. Hope this is helpful. Good luck however you proceed."

        "In San Diego, appearances at 341a meetings are mandatory, as in the debtor 'shall' appear, which is provided in the Bankruptcy Code. That said, it is NOT true that there is NO WAY the trustee will reschedule. Depending on your Trustee and the status of your case (due diligence documents provided, petition and statement of affairs completed in full and as accurate as possible) a one time continuance is usually permitted. You should have your attorney contact the trustee ahead of time, to advise the trustee of the conflict and of the request to continue. If you are self represented, this will fall on your shoulders, and could complicate matters. Having said all this, the continuance would likely only be for a few weeks at most, so if you are looking to try and get outside the 6 month probation period, that may become problematic. All you can do is ask. Failing all of this, if the case is dismissed for failure to appear, in some instances you can move to vacate the dismissal, at further cost, of course. Good Luck. John C.

        "I agree with the answer above. In addition, you should know that the rescheduled date will not be up to your discretion. It will be set by the trustee and probably be about 30 days after the current date. That meeting you cannot miss, unless you want ot jeopardize your discharge.\n\nIf you cannot make the first meeting, please inform the trustee (or have your attorney inform the trustee) well in advance."

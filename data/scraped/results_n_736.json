        "To exempt IRAs, every person that files for relief under the bankruptcy code can use 11 USC ยง 522(b)(c)(3) which states that the following retirement plans are exempt: \"(C) retirement funds to the extent that those funds are in a fund or account that is exempt from taxation under section 401, 403, 408, 408A, 414, 457, or 501(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.\"\n\nSection 408 covers IRAs.\n\nHowever, I agree with Mr. Granvold on why filing for relief under the bankruptcy code pro se is a mistake a large percentage of the time.

But the most important thing is to meet with an attorney as you asking this question means you have not. You care about 2 goals: keeping everything you have equity in and discharging all your debts. If you don't have any of the exceptions to discharge you will obtain that goal; most exceptions are set forth in 11 USC. 523 (Google it) like child support, some income taxes, traffic (in a ch 7) and criminal fines , and presumption of student loans.

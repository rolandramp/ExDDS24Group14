        "Not necessarily. While the general statute of limitations for breach of written contract is four years from breach or date of last payment (whichever is later), the HOA might be able to argue a 5 year statute of limitations applies. In California, HOAs are governed by the Davis-Stirling Common Interest Development Act. Arguably, a court could allow a 5 year statute of limitations as a breach of an equitable servitude. Pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure section 336(b), the statute of limitations for violation of a CC&R provision or a rule is 5 years from the time the HOA board discovers the violation or, through the exercise of reasonable diligence, should have discovered the violation. So, unless you file for bankruptcy to discharge such debts, you are not necessarily off the hook for the unpaid HOA assessments."

        "Your XG exercised her legal right under federal law to discharge her debts, including her obligation to the landlord. You would violate federal law by suing her. You and she must have been behind on the rent, because it's unlikely that the landlord would otherwise have gotten a judgment that would permit garnishment of you pay -- plus, you must not have shown up in court to oppose the eviction. Either make a deal with the landlord that will allow you to stay where you are, or else pay the damages and move on with your life.",
        "As my colleagues have already noted, your ex-girlfriend did not need to obtain your consent to file for bankruptcy. To the extent that she qualified for Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 bankruptcy, she has already or is working toward a discharge of any personal liability of hers to the landlord.\n\nBe careful, if you were to attempt to sue her for recovering any debt discharged by her bankruptcy, then you would be violating the bankruptcy discharge injunction, and the Bankruptcy Court would likely sanction you for contempt of the discharge. The court does not take kindly to violations of the Automatic Stay (while a bankruptcy case is pending) or of the Discharge (after a bankruptcy case is discharged) and will generally award monetary sanctions against anyone trying to collect from the bankruptcy debtor.",
        "I am puzzled why you would expect an ex to get your permission to exercise her legal right to file a bankruptcy. The law does not require anyone, including creditors, to consent to someone filing bankruptcy.\n\nYou may wish to contact a local attorney to determine if there is a way to resolve the garnishment by making the most of the bankruptcy filing. By that, I mean settling the lawsuit for a lump sum of cash.\n\nHope this perspective helps!"

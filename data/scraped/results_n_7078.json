    "question": "The S Corporation owes about $500,000 to various vendors, including the FTB and some fees and penalties to the EDD. The other 2 members who hold 75%, wish to keep the corporation alive (without paying any debt, they have a pie in the sky idea of taking the company through an SEC audit to take it on the pink sheets or OTCBB). I wish to dissolve it (which would probably require a corporate bk).",

        "You are really getting way ahead of yourself by the time you talk about filing bankruptcy for a new start. You need to get copies of all the documents and sit down with a lawyer. Some debts belong only to the corporation, not the shareholders, even if income is \"passed through\" by virtue of being having made a subchapter S election. Some are problematic, like EDD obligations. Gosh only knows if your shares were ever issued properly, if you have a management agreement, etc. Don't be offended, but when you talk about an SEC \"audit\" it is obvious you have all never used a lawyer which was a big mistake. Hire an attorney to work out a strategy with you. Your co-shareholders will take you much more seriously if they get a letter from an attonrey instead of you personally. We do this type of work if you wish to contact me through the Avvo profile. There are other very good Avvo attorneys in LA that do the same."

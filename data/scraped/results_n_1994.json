    "question": "I would like to sue in small claims court to collect $8,000. The person I am suing is filing for bankruptcy. My question is if I proceed with suing him now, and win, what are my chances of ever collecting the money that I am owed if he files for bankruptcy? If he files, will my judgement against him follow him after the bankruptcy or will it be lost and then I have no hope of ever collecting the money he owes me?",

        "Assuming that you have not received actual notice that a bankruptcy was filed, including a case number, you can proceed in small claims. If after you file the small claims action, you receive notice of the bankruptcy (notice is sent to creditors by the bankruptcy court), you must then stop all further attempts to collect the debt. However, you may have recourse in the bankruptcy case itself. Meeting with a bankruptcy attorney will provide the information you need to make a decision on what might be done with regard to your claim.",
        "Bankruptcy courts are no-nonsense places. If you make your claim there and prove it was some sort of intentional conduct to deprive you of your motorcycle, the bankruptcy judge may well not only approve your claim, but make it nondischargeable, which would mean it survives the bankruptcy discharge, assuming he even gets one.",

        "Small claims would be a bad way to go because in order to be able to collect this debt after a bankruptcy you need to have a finding one way or another that the debt was related to the commission of a crime.

When the bankruptcy is filed, you will only have a short time to bring an action in bankruptcy court to have the court decide that bankruptcy will not allow the discharge of this particular debt. Hope this perspective helps!",
        "A lot would depend on the basis of the suit, but in any event, you would need to proceed with any potential claim in bankruptcy court. Contact a local lawyer to help you understand if filing an adversary proceeding would be appropriate."

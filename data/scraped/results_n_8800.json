    "title": "I financed a motorcycle for my now ex-boyfriend, it was stolen, he refuses to pay the monthly payment. Where can I sue in CA?",
    "question": "It is under my name legally. We didn't have full coverage, so we owe about 9000 on a 2009 Suzuki JGSR. He ended the relationship, but refuses to pay the 250 monthly installment fee (which will continue for 3 years), even though he has the motorcycle license and it is his bike. It was not a gift. It was also his fault it was stolen because he left the key in the trunk cover. I don't know if I can sue him in small claims court (max is 7500 in California). He owes me thousands in credit card debt that is also above the max allowed in small claims. What are my options?",
    "answers": [
        "This is a challenging set of facts. If you owe this much and the motorcycle is gone and insurance has paid what it can (you indicated it was not full coverage), then expect the finance company to come after you, since the debt was only in your name. If they do that, you could then cross claim against your ex-boyfriend for this debt and all other debts that you believe he owes you. If you sue in small claims court, you will not be able to cover the $9000 on this debt and whatever amounts are on the other debts you incurred for him. Finally, save all letters he sent you and you sent him about his paying these debts. You may be able to use these letters to show that he agreed to pay them in writing, which will really help you and it gives you a longer statute of limitations (four years, versus two years). Hopefully, he has a job and you can garnish his wages and levy his bank account, if you get a judgment.\n\nThis will also appear on your credit as a default on this debt, so you need to decide what you want to do about that. If you owe lots of debts due to him and this motorcycle debt, perhaps you may want to consult a bankruptcy attorney to explore that as an option. I don't know your asset or income situation, which may make a Chapter 7 improper, but I just wanted you to know some possible options.",
        "You can sue in LA Superior Court if the amounts your ex owes you is more than the $7,500 Small Claims court maximum.\n\nIf you're unfamiliar with litigation procedures, this can get overwhelming, so you'll probably need to hire a lawyer for help, or you could try the DIY methods using the guide linked below or one like it, written for non-lawyers who want to handle cases that are too big for Small Claims court.\n\nDisclaimer: Please note that this answer does not constitute legal advice, and should not be relied on, since each state has different laws, each situation is fact specific, and it is impossible to evaluate a legal problem without a comprehensive consultation and review of all the facts and documents at issue. This answer does not create an attorney-client relationship."

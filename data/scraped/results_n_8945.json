    "title": "Chapter 7 Statement of Intentions...What if I change my mind and don't want to reaffirm my car and/or home?",
    "question": "I am in the Central district of California. I am wondering what the effect is if I decide NOT to reaffirm my car and/or mortgage after having stated my intention to reaffirm? MUST I amend the statement of intentions? Also, is there any binding effect because I said I wanted to keep and reaffirm? Someone told me mortgages never bother to send out reaffirmation documents anyway...would that mean I would be off the hook in the future for any future deficiencies if I kept the house and then later fell into default? Why don't they send them? Will changing my mind hold up my discharge at all? Sorry for the multiple questions, but I do greatly appreciate the advice.",

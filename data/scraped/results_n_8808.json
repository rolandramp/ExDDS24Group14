        "The answer to all of your questions depends on whether the employer does a financial background check on its candidates.

        "Whether a bad credit score will affect your ability to get a job will depend on the employment laws of your state, the type of job you're seeking and the policies of your employer.

Accounts that show some form of payment or settlement are less damaging that unpaid accounts where liability is still open-ended.

        "Consider a prospective employer's position. No employer relishes the thought of hiring an employee that is obviously going to be garnished as soon as they are hired.

Good luck in the job market.\n\nDisclaimer: Please note that this answer does not constitute legal advice, and should not be relied on, since each state has different laws, each situation is fact specific, and it is impossible to evaluate a legal problem without a comprehensive consultation and review of all the facts and documents at issue.

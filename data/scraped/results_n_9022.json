        "The short answer to your question is that they can garnish your wages, but only AFTER they file a lawsuit aginst you and win. If they haven't filed a lawsuit against you yet, they cannot garnish your wages yet.\n\nYou should also check into how exactly they verified your income, because they are not allowed to discuss your debt with outside parties other than your attorney.\n\nIf they do in fact file a lawsuit, you have 30 days to get an answer in, or else they will win automatically, and then they really can garnish your wages. In that event, you will want to contact an attorney to prepare a response for you ( and there are fees associated with filing an answer in court, though if your income falls below a certain threshold these may be waived).\n\nYou may also want to contact an FDCPA attorney. While you don't get specific enough in your description to illustrate an obvious violation ( perhaps they already have a judgement and you don't know it, in which case you'll need to contact an attorney to file a motion to vacate a default judgement), there's enough here to really hint at a violation. If there was in fact a violation you can sue them.\n\nAt the very least, don't let them intimidate you with this. Payday loan collectors have to follow the same rules as every other credit collector.",
        "It sounds like you are being scammed by a debt collector. Debt collectors are notorious liars. They will tell you all sorts of things (mostly lies) to get you to pay them. You don't have to go to court from receiving a telephone call. Everything done in a legitimate court is done on paper. No papers = no court proceedings.\n\nYou should consult an experienced consumer attorney in your state as soon as you can.",
        "Before they can garnish wages, they must file a lawsuit in court, then they serve the lawsuit on you properly. If you fail to answer within the time provided, then they must request a default judgment against you, which the clerk will enter in all likelihood. If an when they find out where you work and, they can ask the court for an Earnings Withholding Order and serve your employer to garnish your wages at the appropriate amount. See my legal guide, below, on keeping the garnishment amount reasonable.\n\nHowever, if there is a debt collector involved, you may not realize that you have one or more defenses to this lawsuit, that may get the case dismissed. My suggestion is stay on top of this, because they make important mistakes and delays, and you need to protect your rights, so you don't pay them any more than you need to. You can follow up with me privately through my Avvo profile. I have been defending debt collection cases since 1997.\n\nBe sure to make notes for all of those collection calls in as much detail as possible, including the date and time. I am not sure but if they contacted your employer, they may have said things that are illegal and violate the debt collection laws. You should try to find out if they really spoke with someone at your office and what they said to him or her. They may also may be lying to you about verifying your income, to intimidate you, which is illegal.",
        "No. They cannot garnish your wages unless and until they sue you in court and get a judgment against you. Do not listen to their lies. Tell them you consulted with a lawyer and know they cannot garnish your wages. You can negotiate a payment plan with them. That is all they can do without a lawsuit.\n\nThe response given is not intended to create, nor does it create an ongoing duty to respond to questions. The response does not form an attorney-client relationship, nor is it intended to be anything other than the educated opinion of the author. It should not be relied upon as legal advice. The response given is based upon the limited facts provided by the person asking the question. To the extent additional or different facts exist, the response might possibly change.

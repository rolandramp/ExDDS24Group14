        "It means you get to keep the house and you have to keep paying for it. Many clients tell me \"I don't want to put the house in the bankruptcy\". You have to put everything in, you do not have a choice. But the re-affirmation means you are taking the house (and the mortgages) out of the bankruptcy. Once you re-affirm, the creditor has all of the rights and remedies they would have as if there never were a bankruptcy in the first place. So, as long as you keep up the payments, everybody's happy. If you don't, they can forclose, sell the house and sue you for any shortfall. Interestingly, I have read on Avvo that there is some difference of opinion as to whether you \"have to\" re-affirm. My answer is \"yes\", but I don't practice in CA.",
        "What we don't know is really what your goal is. If you are keeping up the payments as indicated, I will assume you want the place. However, if not reaffirmed as you have not done, then the personal liability is discharged. As a result, no personal debt is owed so that if you end up letting the house be foreclosed on, you will not have any personal liability ..you can live there free until a foreclosure occurs and beyond until the state law in your state states when you must vacate after a sale. So, if one spouse dies and the other cannot afford the payments or if you just don't want to keep paying on it, you can try to determine how long you could live there for free (IN Washington it would probably be 8 months or more) and multiply x the $ you are paying out on all mortgages monthly and see what that pile ends up totaling! Then decide..do you want to keep the place or not. But no matter what, all of us attorneys want you to know if LATER you change your mind and let the place be foreclosed on, you will owe no monies. If you have any HOA dues, they will not be discharged from the filing date until the property is not in your name also! Good luck and I hope this fully answers your question and I wont repeat what all the other attorneys have stated repeatedly on the reaffirmation! Good luck. PS if the FMV of the property is worth LESS than the 1st mortgage, you might want to speak to a great ch 13 bankruptcy attorney about filing a ch 20 and the possible availability of wiping off the 2nd mortgage in that \"chapter 20\" as we call them..this is new area of bankruptcy cases slowly being published on that special issue!",
        "It is not possible to reaffirm a debt after the discharge order has been entered in your Chapter 7 case. Prior to discharge, if you are a debtor not represented by counsel that enters into a reaffirmation agreement for a consumer debt secured by real property, the Bankruptcy Code section 524(c)(6)(B) provides that the judge doesn't need to approve the agreement. Most attorneys will not sign real property loan reaffirmation agreements for their clients. Some real property loans are non-recourse (meaning that state law prevents lender from collecting the deficiency balance of loan after foreclosure of the real property) such that reaffirmation of the loan doesn't really matter. However, it would be a big mistake to reaffirm a recourse loan (such a non-purchase money, home equity line of credit) and give up the benefits of your Chapter 7 discharge.",
        "Reaffirming a debt undermines what bankruptcy does for you by making you again personally liable for the debt. For your vehicle, this means that if you fall behind on payments and it is repossessed, the bank can sue you for the difference between the value of the car and the amount you owe. Attorneys almost never recommend that a mortgage be reaffirmed and many judges won't approve mortgage reaffirmations. The downside of not reaffirming is that your monthly mortgage payments are not reported on your credit report. Do not attempt to reaffirm a mortgage debt without consulting with an attorney.",
        "Reaffirming debt means you agree to be personally liable for it as if you never filed bankruptcy. The law says vehicle lenders can repossess the vehicle, even if you're current on the payments, unless you reaffirm (although most will not do so as long as you timely make the payments). The same rule does not apply to mortgage lenders, and in my professional opinion it is seldom a good idea to reaffirm mortgage loans.",
        "No, reaffirmation of mortgage debts is not required, nor will most attorneys encourage them and most judges will not approve them. There was a provision in the 2005 bankruptcy reform bill which gave lienholders for secured personal property such as cars or boats the right to demand that debts file a reaffirmation agreement if the debtor's filing bankruptcy was listed as a default in whatever financing agreement the debtor had with the lienholder, but that rule does not apply to real property such as a mortgage on a house or mobile home."

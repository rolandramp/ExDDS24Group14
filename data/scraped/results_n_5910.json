    "title": "Midland Funding sued me without my knowledge. There was a judgement placed against me last month without my knowledge.",
    "question": "In March of 2012 they served me and I immediately called. We set up a payment plan in which they suck money out of my account. I was told that this would end any problems with this account. They send me a letter every month thanking me for the payments. So they obviously have a way to contact me. Spoke with them two days ago to update my moving address. Now I get this thing in the mail saying that they took me to court in November. Why?! And how can I be sued when I haven't even been served? The original \"court date\" was March 21st. But that was taken care of March 20th. This court date seems to be on Nov 14th. Does this happen often? People being sued without being summonsed? And while they are paying off a debt? What do I do now? And what does the judgement even mean?",

        "I agree with my colleagues. I suggest you obtain copies of all the court records filed in the case, and then consult with a collections defense attorney who practices in the county in which the case was filed. Good luck.",
        "The judgment may well have been in the same case on which you received a summons in November. Midland then took your default even though you were performing under the agreement. Or it could have sued you twice for the same debt. Neither makes it look very good.\n\nHustle to an attorney to have the judgment set aside.",

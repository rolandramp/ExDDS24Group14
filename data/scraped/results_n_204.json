    "title": "I have a judgement from a real estate transaction in 2008. Can I appeal it if I never plead my case?",
    "question": "I had a couple of partners in a real estate transaction in 2008 and lost the house to foreclosure. They took me to court and received a judgement because I was told not to go and just take care of it BK court. But it wasnâ€™t discharged because of my lack of representation. If allowed to give my version and supporting facts, I think it would have been a different outcome.",

        "You are out of luck for several reasons. One is that you waited far too long to have your version of the facts presented. You needed to do that in 2008, and not wait until 2020, 12 years later, to bring up the issue. Further, if you filed a bankruptcy case and it failed due to lack of representation, means that you never hired an attorney to assist you.\n\nWhat you now need to do is hire an attorney, get all your issues properly addressed with the assistance of counsel, and not worry about your version of the facts of a case from 2008.\n\nGood Luck.",
        "I would agree with the other comments made by these attorneys. The debt on a judgment can be 10 years and renewed for at least another 10 years. Defending the case, well, that boat sailed long ago.\n\nAs to the bankruptcy. There are a number of possibilities.\n\nFirst, if it was never filed, it does not exist. However, it sounds like you filed a case. Then the question is whether you got a discharge in the bankruptcy (not a dismissal.)\n\nIf you got a discharge, then the question is whether there were \"assets\" that were taken by the bankruptcy trustee that were divided amongst the creditors (an asset case.)\n\nThen were they listed? If they were properly listed or the case had no assets than you should not have them going after you. The bankruptcy court can stop that. It may take a lawsuit (Contempt) in bankruptcy court to fix this.\n\nIf you filed and they filed a \"non-dischargeability action\" against you claiming fraud and you did not fight it, the debt may not have been discharged.\n\nAnother possibility is that if you did everything right BUT they had a JUDGMENT LIEN recorded against you, AND you owned real property (land, home or other building) the LIEN would not have gone away. They could not collect money from you but when you tried to refinance or sell a property they did not have to release the lien without being paid. In that situation, which I regularly see, the bankruptcy can be reopened and the judgment lien removed IF the property could be exempted and protected.\n\nThe above is just the tip of the iceberg and there are dozens of other possibilities.\n\nThe only way to know for sure is to get advice from a highly skilled bankruptcy attorney in your area.\n\nYou can go to the State Bar website and look up State Bar Certified Bankruptcy Law Specialists in Sacramento. Only a fraction of 1% of attorneys are certified by the state bar as bankruptcy specialists. If the State Bar says they are good enough to get that Ceritification, then they have to be at the top of their skills in bankruptcy.\n\nYou can also go to the National Association of Consumer Bankruptcy Attorneys (NACBA.org) website that provides lists of attorneys in your area that represent consumer debtors only (not creditors.)\n\nYou can also look at the AVVO.com lists. However, if you go there, look for:\n1. The AVVO rating (10.0) first. (Do not just look at the client reviews as they are not always that reliable and you can always have someone complain even when you do your best.\n\n2. Open the attorney's PROFILE: See if they have had ATTORNEYS ENDORSE (recommend) them. Attorneys do not endorse other attorneys lightly. You have to be a very good attorney to have other attorneys recommend you.\n\n3. Look at their time in practice doing bankruptcy law.\n\n4. See if they have experience teaching bankruptcy law to other attorneys.\n\n5. Look at the \"pie chart.\" See how much of their practice is in bankruptcy law. You do not want someone who does everything under the sun because that means they do not have the time or desire to specialize and be the best at one thing. What you want is someone who practices almost exclusively bankruptcy and consumer law.\n\nI hope this information helps you.",
        "Your facts are not clear. Did you file a bankruptcy case? If so, which Chapter was filed? Did you receive a discharge of debts, or was your case dismissed or entire discharge denied? What do you mean you never \"plead your case\"? If this specific debt wasn't discharged (as opposed to a denial of your entire discharge), that means that the creditor filed a Complaint Objecting to Discharge of the debt and you did not timely proffer a defense. If you were properly served notice (Summons and Complaint) and failed to respond then you have no basis to appeal anything. If you did not receive the Summons and Complaint or there was some other grounds, such as \"excusable neglect\", then you might have a basis to set aside the Judgement (within the time frames allowed under the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure) and allow the trial to go forward.",
        "Did you file a chapter 7 case?\n\nIf the debt was incurred before your petition was filed, the debt may indeed be discharged, even if it was reduced to judgment after your petition date, and even if the debt is not listed in the schedules. More information is needed.\n\nYou have better chances arguing the debt is discharged compared to opening a judgment from 12 years ago.",
        "You are way too late to appeal a judgment from 2008 but it may have expired if it wasn't renewed properly in 2018. You need to meet with an experienced bankruptcy attorney who can review the facts and the record and advise you properly."

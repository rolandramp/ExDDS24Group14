        "There's no rule or law that a bankrutpcy will or won't prevent you from being able to rent; these are individual lender/landlord decisions.

        "Probably not. Landlords care more that you have not had any unlawful detainer actions (evictions). Indeed, if you have discharged your debts in bankruptcy or settled your debts and they are all paid (even if not paid timely), then at least the landlord will know that you will probably have the funds to make consistent rent payments. The thing that landlords like least are having to collect back rent, deal with bounced rent checks, and evictions. If the tenant has no debt collection agency to settle with or outstanding debt collection judgment, the tenant will likely be okay with making the monthly rent.\n\nRobert Stempler (please see DISCLAIMER below)\nwww.StopCollectionLawsuits.com\nwww.facebook.com/SoCalConsumerLawyer\nTwitter: @RStempler"

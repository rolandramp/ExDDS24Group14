    "title": "How can I prevent a defendant from hiding their assets in an LLC?",
    "question": "I'm going to be filing a small claims suit against somebody for $10K. She violated civ 51 civ 1942.5 and negligently inflicted emotional distress. I am afraid though that if I win and get a judgement in my favor that the defendant will use her LLC as a shelter. So I am considering if I should name the LLC as a defendant as well or if I should wait to file against it separately with an added fraud cause of action in a higher jurisdiction court. I'm awaiting an UD complaint to be filed against me just so I can have my motion to quash heard which will concretely prove that I've been paying rent to a fraudster.",

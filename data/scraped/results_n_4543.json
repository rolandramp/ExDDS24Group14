    "question": "Hello and thank you for your respond! My daughter rented a book from Valorebooks.com. We never got the book.We contacted them they said the seller sent us the book. We checked the post office they said they deliver the book but we never got it. We filled a complain with the post office . They said they can do nothing about it because the mail wasn't insured. We again contact the Valorebooks and they also said that we cant do nothing. We made a dispute with our bank and we got the money back. now after a year they gave my daughter who is 17 to collection agency. What is the right thing to do in this case. Thank you!",

        "The \"right\" thing isn't necessarily the \"correct\" thing. First - one question - you say your daughter \"rented\" a book, but the \"seller\" sent it. It sounds like a purchase, esp. since you're talking about \"getting your money back.\" That said, here's the issue - the seller says they shipped it. The post office says they delivered it. So, it's your word against theirs - you'll lose. Many people take delivery of something only to claim they never got it. And, since it wasn't insured, you're on the hook. So, pay the bill and end this."

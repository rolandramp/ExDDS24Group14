    "answers": [
        "Date of separation is the date one spouse communicates to the other that s/he wants out of the marriage. Most often this is done verbally, which creates a problem of proof. I once mediated a matter that had just come out of a 3-day trial on date of separation alone. The reason this date is so important is because it serves as a cut-off date for community assets and debts. Before the date of separation, all assets and debts accumulated are 50% yours and 50% his, with few exceptions. After date of separation, if your spouse racks up $50k in credit card purchases, the debt is 100% his. Now, there are times when a spouse may have to continue using his/her, now, separate property income to pay for community obligations or to maintain community assets. In such situations, s/he would be \"entitled\", under the law, to a reimbursement and/or credit for such payments. Remember, just because one of you wants out does not mean that neither of you is response for the mortgage payments, rent, vehicle payments, utilities, etc. In order to protect your credit, keep your cars, house, apartment, etc, these have to be paid.\n\nGood luck to you both. If you would like more information, feel free to contact me or visit my web site.",
        "\"Separation\" is a term of art used in California measured by a date when one party or the other determined the marriage was not going to continue and communicates that unequivocally to the other party. \"Legal separation\" is a process which parallels the marital dissolution process except at the end you have done everything you would do in a divorce except terminate the \"status\" (ie. you're not free to remarry).\n\nIf you are \"separated\" (that first definition), after the date of separation each party's income is his or her own and each party's newly-acquired debts are his or her own. Whether or not you are \"separated\" may be a decision a judge makes at the time of trial so, until then, debts on existing credit cards, for example, may not yet be determined to be yours or your spouse's and the creditor may have both parties on the hook for payment."

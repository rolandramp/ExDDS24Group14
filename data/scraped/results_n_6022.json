        "It is not entirely clear whatyou are asking, but I believe you are asking if you can keep property secured by a bank's claim, such as a car loan or home mortgage. The basic answer is that all secured portions of debt survive bankruptcy, which means that you will have to pay for the items you intend to keep in some fashion or another. For example, you cannot expect to \"erase\" debt on your car and not pay the payments, but still keep it. You either have to keep making the payments or file a chapter that allows you to pay only what the car is worth. For example, let's say you have a car worth $10K but you owe $15K on it. There are chapters that will allow you to pay the $10K and respread the note over as much as 36 to 60 months (depending upon your jurisdiction and the circumstances) -- often at a lower interest rate than what you may be paying.\n\nIf this sounds confusing, it is: I highly suggest you find competent local bankruptcy counsel to help you decide what options are best for your situation."

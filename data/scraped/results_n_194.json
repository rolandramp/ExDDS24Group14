        "How much was if for? When did you receive it? Are you married? If so, how much does you spouse make? What is your household size? All these questions plus others must be answered to determine if your severance effects your ability to file a chapter 7 bankruptcy. You may or may not qualify for chapter 7 depending on the amount you received and your prior income levels. Severance is income for bankruptcy purposes. Please consult with an experienced bankruptcy asap so you know your options.",
        "Information provided already covers the issues. Most important - find an experienced bankruptcy attorney who can evaluate your options - a lot depends upon the amount you received or are going to receive and timing.",
        "Whether the severance pay will \"affect\" your bankruptcy depends entirely on how much it was and how much it increases your \"average\" monthly income over the six months prior to filing. If, for example, you received it in June, it would have no effect on your BK if you file in January.\nBut even if you have to include it and the 6-mo average exceeds the median income in CA for your family size, you will still likely qualify for Chapter 7 (assuming you would have qualified otherwise) because of case law which would allow you to \"rebut\" the presumption of abuse.",
        "Although not all of our San Diego area bankruptcy attorneys are back in the office, most of us are available for phone consultations. Most of us offer free consultations.\n\nThe severance pay will be income that counts in your Means Test if you get it during the 6 months prior to your case being filed. It will also be an asset that needs to be protected if you have any of it left.\n\nWhether you can or should file a bankruptcy now depends on a lot of detail that you should not share in a public forum. Call around and find someone who can give you specific advice based on your particular circumstances.",
        "Talk to a bankruptcy attorney about your specific situation. It may or may not have an affect on a bankruptcy filing. It's all about numbers and timing. Most bankruptcy attorneys offer free consultations.",
        "Maybe, but it is a one time payment, right? You will need to fill out a Means Test to include all your income. That is how the court knows whether or not you qualify for BK 7.

        "It depends and is one of those things you need to talk to with a knowledgeable bankruptcy attorney in your area.",
        "Agreeing with the above, an attorney responding to this question would need more information.\n\nIt is likely that you will be able to receive good bankruptcy relief, but when and how you file, and which chapter you select, all depend on the amounts you received and when.",
        "I don't know if it will affect your bankruptcy, but it definitely will be income included in the means test, assuming you receive it in the 6 calendar months prior to filing your case. And depending on how much you receive (and when you receive it and what Chapter you are filing), you may or may not be able to exempt (protect) it all.\n\nWhether or not the means test applies in your case will depend on a number of factors, including whether your debts are primarily consumer or non-consumer, whether you are in active military and some other things.\n\nAs always, it is best to have a consultation with an experienced bankruptcy attorney to go over your entire situation and determine what you are eligible for and what issues need to be addressed."

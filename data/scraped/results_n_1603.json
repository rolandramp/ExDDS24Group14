    "question": "I'm going to file an answer and probably moving into discovery at some point. My question is about this... I keep hearing stories about \"If you can't afford their settlement or payment plan, go to court and tell the judge you can only afford $X a month\" and \"I know someone who went to court, represented themselves, pleaded poverty, and got the judge to make the collection agency accept $5 per month to pay down the debt. No kidding\" etc.",

        "Once a collection begins via wage garnishment a debtor will have an opportunity to object to the amount by filling out hardship paperwork, filing it with the court, and having a non-party serve it on the plaintiff. This gives low income debtor's a chance to reduce what would otherwise be impossible to meet payment plans.",
        "There is no hard and fast rule here. The first question that you need to address is whether the creditor is going to show up at trial with evidence or not. If the creditor doesn't have evidence, case closed and no payments would be necessary. The time to make payment arrangements on a debt was before a creditor had to sue you to get paid. Now that the creditor is before a court, expect them to want protection via a court order.l The result - if you have a payment agreement and are one day or one dollar late, no more Mr Nice Guy. The creditor will have the right to garnish your pay and seize any assets not protected under state laws called exemptions. Hope this perspective helps!",
        "The parties to litigation negotiate a resolution directly. In debt collection cases, the judges do not get involved until AFTER a judgment and then only in connection with certain events, such as a hearing on claim of exemption to a bank levy or wage garnishment. I suggest that you work with a debt collection DEFENSE attorney and not end up with a judgment against you. Your proposal of $5 will not resolve the judgment and it will continue to grow at 10% per year, which doubles the amount due every 10 years."

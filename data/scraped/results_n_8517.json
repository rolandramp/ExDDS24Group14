        "Regardless of the reasons for the breakdown in communications here, and regardless of what the contract may say, the State Bar and fee arbitrators take a dim view of attorneys retaining any amount of funds not earned by work for the client.

        "So you go to a lawyer and pay $850 and you then do not contact the attorney for 6 months and you fire him because he does not call you to remind you to take to the lawyer the papers he needed to complete your bankruptcy petition. You expected the lawyer to remind you to take him the papers because your accountant reminds you when you turn in your paperwork. It is your obligation to comply with the requests by your lawyer and accountant and you should not have to be reminded by them. If the contract with the lawyer says that the $850 is a nonrefundable retainer and you fired the lawyer because he didn't remind you to take your paperwork to the lawyer to prepare your bankruptcy petition then I do not believe you are nettled to a refund even if the attorney spent only 30 minutes on your case as you claim. A nonrefundable retainer is a nonrefundable retainer and it was you who terminated the contract. The fact that the attorney did not remind you to do what you were supposed to do is not just cause or ground to terminate the contract with your bankruptcy lawyer. By the way, there is no statute of limitations for filing a complaint with the State Bar. You can also sue the attorney in Small Claims Court or have the fee dispute arbitrated. I doubt you will win unless I misunderstood the facts but you do have the right and opportunity to have your case heard and decided by a court or arbitrator. I do suggest you discuss your complaint with the attorney first to see if you can reach an amicable resolution.",
        "If you paid $850 and nothing or little more took place besides the initial consult, you should get money back of course but did you ask? It sounds like he didn't feel he was retained until he got the whole amount and you didn't get in touch with him, either. His method of taking $850 partial payment and not following thru or being clear with you what he is doing or not doing ; what's expected from you each..sounds sloppy and invites trouble. I don't know his version. Is there a written agreement setting forth how this was to work? Its hard for attorneys to arrange payments because of this problem that the payments are not made and we need clear agreements and clear communication to protect both sides from misunderstandings. He should have been following up contacting you, too. The bankruptcy court and DOJ have jurisdiction over bankruptcy fees as well as your local fee arbitration thru the county bar. You can call the state bar, too. Ethical issues and fee disputes are two different matters. I can't make any conclusions sounds as if it wasn't handled clearly. Assuming this is a consumer bankruptcy I'd say $850 and no work on your case , he''ll have to give money back. Did you ask him what work he did and how much he will refund if you don't go forward with his services?"

    "title": "Do you have to list each item on a FL-160, FL-142 and the worksheets determining community and separate value??",
    "question": "My ex and I just want to get divorced. He lives in another state and we haven't been together for 3 years. We have agreed that neither of us wants anything from each other. So we're wondering if we really have to list everything. We were only together for 3 months after we got married. we really didn't do much cheaper together property or community wise.",
    "answers": [
        "You both have a \"fiduciary duty\" to each other as and for disclosure of assets/debts, but the values don't necessarily have to be determined at the time of you doing the \"declaration of disclosures\".\n\nSince it seems like there minimal assets/debts in your divorce, I seriously doubt that when you submit your judgment, you will have to deal with having to \"prove up\" to the court that there was an \"equal division\" of assets/debts.",
        "Full discovery of all separate property and community property claims are required in both the Preliminary Declarations of Disclosure and the Final Declarations of disclosure. You can waive the Final Declaration of Disclsoure mutually between the parties. But, even if all you have is separate property, this must be fully disclosed.",
        "If you have no community property together you can so state that on the forms. However, California law requires each party to list his/her assets and debts. You certainly don' t have to list each item of furniture or personal property, just the big stuff: houses, cars, bank accounts, retirement and debts."

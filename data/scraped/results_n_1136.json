    "title": "Can i still collect on a judgement if the restaurant it's against reopens elsewhere, maybe even with a different name?",
    "question": "I quit working at a restaurant a year ago and filed a wage claim against the business, and then i won that case, receiving a judgement of just over 3,000 dollars. The owner of the business refused to pay me and closed the restaurant, so it was tough luck, it seemed. Recently, though, rumours are that the owner is going to reopen the restaurant in a neighbouring town. Im wondering how this could affect me. Does this mean i can still collect the judgement (would i need a writ of execution)? If the restaurant has a different name, would i have to go through the wage claim again? Also, does it make a difference that the judgement was issued in a neighboring county? It was issued in San Diego, rather than here in Imperial, because the dlse agents said they've lost funding to stay down here.",

        "Even if these are different entities, you might be able to go after the second restaurant depending on if it bought the assets or business from the first restaurant without going through a bulk sale. There might be a fraudulent transfer as well. If you can develop some information about how it was handled you could try going after a new entity in small claims court. If your award is against an individual then you should go after that person's assets.",
        "You really need to talk to an employment/ wage and hour attorney, but I will speculate that if the owner is operating as a sole proprietorship you may be able to collect, but if two seperate corporations or LLCs are involved, you are probably out of luck"

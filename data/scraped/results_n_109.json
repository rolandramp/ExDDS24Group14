    "title": "Can a court judgment for back rent be discharged in a chapter 7 bankruptcy?",
    "question": "I was in a lease with another person.",
    "answers": [
        "1) Can the judgment be discharged? Yes, generally, with the exceptions as mentioned above by my colleagues and found in 11 USC 523 and 727; and\n2) If so, will the other person still be liable? Yes, unless the other person was a spouse and then the other person could obtain the \"community property discharge\" from you filing and obtaining a discharge.\n\nSeek advise from an experienced bankruptcy attorney in your area before filing anything.\n\nStay well!",
        "Such a debt is dischargeable and unfortunately a common problem some are experiencing right now, An exception would be if there is malice or fraud involved. You want to be sure that your circumstances qualify you for chapter 7 discharge in general as well, regardless of what type of debts you have. An attorney will want to know the extent of your assets, debts, income, and household expenses to advise you further.",
        "Good answers have been provided to you in response to your questions. I urge you to meet with an experienced bankruptcy attorney to assist you in this process. Good Luck.",
        "Generally, absent fraud, willful and malicious harm or embezzlement, back rent is dischargeable in both a Ch. 7 and Ch. 13 proceedings. If another person was a contracted signatory on the lease, then right, the landlord could go try and collect for all of the remaining back rent from that other person or persons. You should definitely seek out the assistance of an attorney to examine your options. JCC",
        "As you can see...YES..but if you intentionally damaged property then IF they sued you in Bankruptcy Court and established that it could be non-dischargeable..but that is known to you if you damaged walls on purpose, etc. So not very likely.\n\nBut you asking that question means you have NOT discussed with an experienced bankruptcy attorney so I do suggest that is the ONLY thing you need to do next. Why? Other issues and fact can affect your case so I will point out some for you.\n\nYou need and want to enjoy your fresh start also. But the most important thing is to meet with an attorney as you asking this question means you have not. You care about 2 goals: keeping everything you have equity in and discharging all your debts. If you don't have any of the exceptions to discharge you will obtain that goal; most exceptions are set forth in 11 USC. 523 (Google it) like child support, some income taxes, traffic (in a ch 7) and criminal fines , and presumption of student loans. But some debts are dischargeable in a ch 13 but NOT in a ch 7 so you want to make sure and your attorney will discuss any such types with you also!\n\nYour exemptions depend on what state you have lived in in the last 2 years and thus if in your state, then your states exemptions will apply. Most persons filing keep everything they own but your attorney will confirm that with you when they learn everything you own and the equity thereof!\n\nSome secured debts like homes, vehicles, other secured debts an attorney will discuss your options on also as you must list any debts; but that does not mean you will lose them unless you have too much equity or are in default on paying for them! Discuss those options if they apply with your attorney too.\n\nBut other issues can arise that can greatly harm your case. Just one example: If you paid back a relative $3,000 11 months ago and now file bankruptcy next week, the trustee can SUE that relative to retrieve that $3,000 (under what is called a preference) for the benefit of the bankruptcy estate. As a result, most attorneys don't charge to meet with them the first meeting so meet with one no matter what.\n\nMany great attorneys can be found right here on AVVO in your state so look, call, and meet one as soon as you can.\n\nYou should also want to know when to file: is there an advantage of waiting versus filing now and who should you pay between now and then! Good luck and enjoy your later fresh start.",

        "Yes, generally speaking that would be dischargeable in a Chapter 7 Bankruptcy. Your ability to assume the lease in the Chapter 7 Bankruptcy will also be impacted if you were attempting to assume the lease (which is most likely not the case from your description). The other person would still be liable for the debt and would receive notice of your bankruptcy filing as a co-debtor.\n\nOf course you should consult with a lawyer in your locality.",
        "Yes, you can discharge a judgment for back rent in Chapter 7.\n\nYes, the other person will still be liable for the judgment if you discharge it in a Chapter 7 case.\nThat person will also need to be notified of your Chapter 7 case by listing them as a co-debtor in your case."

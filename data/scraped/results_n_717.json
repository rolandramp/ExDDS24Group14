    "title": "Am I responsible for my deceased spouse’s debts?",
    "question": "My spouse recently passed away. My spouse had several credit cards that were in my spouse’s name only. My spouse also had medical debts, such as unpaid insurance deductibles and copays. The insurance is mine, provided through my work. We have several joint assets, such as a house and automobiles. I understand that anything we had jointly is now up to me. How much of my spouse’s debt am I responsible for?",

        "The assets in joint tenancy are beyond the reach of the creditors. In my experience the credit card companies will not come after your for credit card debt that was solely in your deceased spouse's name. They may or may not come after you for the medical bills. I would take a wait and see position on those. Whatever you do, make no rash decisions about your property for at least a year, other than to put it into a living trust..",
        "Very sorry for your loss. Since California is a community property state, you would normally be liable for the entire amount of her debts but only from community property and not from your separate property which includes the property you and your wife held in joint tenancy.",
        "Anything not in joint tenancy could be up for grabs. You need to consult with an attorney to determine if probate is necessary and what assets could be used to pay the debts."

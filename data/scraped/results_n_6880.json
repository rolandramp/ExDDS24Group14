        "There is no basic form (see blog below) to set aside a default judgment, so this is something you may want to leave to an experienced collection defense attorney. Without knowing when the default judgment was entered against you and if a copy of it was served on you after entry and any other contacts and documents that you have had with the Plaintiff's law firm about this case, there is no way to advise which statute applies. For instance, if it has been more than two years since the default judgment was entered, then no statute applies, and the legal basis to set aside the default would be Common Law principles of Due Process and the Constitutional requirements for Due Process.\n\nRobert Stempler (please see DISCLAIMER below)\nwww.StopCollectionLawsuits.com\nTwitter: @RStempler",

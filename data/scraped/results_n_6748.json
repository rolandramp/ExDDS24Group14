        "The other attorney offers sound advice. The tax debt, assuming you and your wife at the time used the filing status of \"married, filing jointly\", is a \"joint and several liability\" meaning that the debt is not half on her and half on you, but both or your debt in full and thus as you are finding out they can try to collect the whole amount from either party (of course they cannot collect more than the amount due in total). Suing her related to the divorce is probably the only way to get her to take responsibility, unless you have what is called an \"innocent spouse claim\". You can review IRS publication 971 on the IRS website to see if you think you qualify. Normally you only qualify if the tax/deductions are attributable to the spouse (not you) and/or if you did not know or where coerced with respect to signing the tax return. I recently was successful on having a divorced spouse relieved of liability because her now ex-husband threatened to strike her if she did not sign the tax return, although it does not always have to rise to this level.",
        "What does the divorce decree say? Regarding debts to third parties, such as the IRS, during the marriage, the third party, including the IRS just wants to be paid in full. It doesn't matter, in that respect, what the Marital Judgment says. If your ex-wife is refusing to pay her half, and it sounds like she is, and it's affecting you, which is also sounds like it is, my suggestion would be to file a motion either as to (1) having this issue adjudicated if that's not already the case; (2) how this will be paid (in case you have to file or chose to file a contempt action); or (3) some sort of reimbursement. You might also want to consider requesting attorneys' fees.\n\nI would really suggest that you hire a lawyer to handle this for you.\n\nMs. Johns is a lawyer although she is not your lawyer unless you have consulted with her and signed a fee or letter agreement confirming her representation of you.

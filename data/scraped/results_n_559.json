        "I agree with my colleagues, is there any reason why you are specifically referring to a chapter 13? A chapter 13 is normally for people whose income is too high to qualify for a chapter 7 and/or you have assets that cannot be protected in a chapter 7. A chapter 13 requires you to make a monthly payment to the Trustee (which goes to your creditors) for 3-5 years. If you qualify for a chapter 7, I would definitely file that to get your unsecured debt eliminated without having to pay anything on it. If you file a chapter 13, interest would stop upon filing and the total balance owed would be the creditor's claim and whether you have to pay their full claim or a portion will depend on your income and assets.",
        "You should also look into Chapter 7. It could be much better for you than a Ch 13. As far as the amounts you owe in Ch 13, the creditor claim will be based on what you owed as of the date you file the case. Ch 13 may prevent future interest, but does not roll back the amount of interest already owed.",
        "There are at least four possibilities for reducing or discharging interest on payday loans. One: settle the debts for the amount that the creditor has agreed to accept. Two: file a chapter 7 bankruptcy case to discharge all your unsecured debts, principal AND interest. If you owe $40,000 to various payday lender or creditors who have purchased those debts, a chapter 7 bankruptcy should be considered.\n\nThree: you would only need to consider a chapter 13 case is you have \"non-exempt property\" such as a house, with more equity in the house than you can protect in the bankruptcy case. For an analysis of chapter 7 versus chapter 13, you can contact a qualified bankruptcy attorney in your area.\n\nFinally, if you do not settle the debts or file a bankruptcy case, you may get sued. In that case you would want to hire a debt collection defense attorney to represent you, Your attorney would need to argue that the interest being sought is \"unconscionable\" and therefore uncollectible. If a case were to go to trial, the court would decide whether the interest rate you were charged should be enforced, or whether it should be reduced to a more reasonable number."

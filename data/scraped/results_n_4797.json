    "title": "I received a CCP 98: Declaration ... in lieu of live testimony. Is this likely to be admissible, considering the address?",
    "question": "I received the Declaration more than 30 days before trial, BUT it contains no address of the declarant, given for service, and I found that the declarant works in Ohio. The Declaration contains no authorization for attorney to accept service. The only address on the entire declaration is the attorney’s address at the top of the first page, several hundred miles from the court.",

        "CCP §98 requires the following as a condition to admit a witnesses declaration:\nTo the extent the contents of the prepared testimony would have been admissible were the witness to testify orally thereto, the prepared testimony shall be received as evidence in the case, provided that either of the following applies:\n\n(a)A copy has been served on the party against whom it is offered at least 30 days prior to the trial, together with a current address of the affiant that is within 150 miles of the place of trial, and the affiant is available for service of process at that place for a reasonable period of time, during the 20 days immediately prior to trial.\n\n(b)The statement is in the form of all or part of a deposition in the case, and the party against whom it is offered had an opportunity to participate in the deposition.\n\nThe court shall determine whether the affidavit or declaration shall be read into the record in lieu of oral testimony or admitted as a documentary exhibit.\n\nFrom the facts you gave, the declaration under CCP §98 is deficient.",
        "In conjunction with your other question posted:\nYou have at least one possible objections to the Declaration in Lieu of Live Testimony.\n\nPer CCP 98, the party who is offering a Declaration in Lieu of Live Testimony must have an address within 150 miles of miles of the court and be \"amenable to service\" at that address. (The purpose of this being, the party can be served with a subpoena to appear.)\n\nIf you don't have such an address, and/or cannot serve such a subpoena because the address given is not the declarant's office, you should make an objection to the use of the Declaration in Lieu of Live Testimony. Plaintiff did not comply with the relevant statutes.\n\nYou can either file a \"motion in limine\" (a motion asking the judge to exclude evidence), or you can make an objection when the plaintiff's attorney shows up with only the declaration (and no witness), and attempts to have the declaration admitted into evidence. If you do the latter, make sure you have reviewed the statutes and outlined your argument in advance. If it's true that no physical address was provided for the declarant, and the judge requires the plaintiff to comply with CCP 98, you should win this argument.\n\nGood luck."

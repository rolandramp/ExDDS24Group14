    "title": "Landlord will not refund security deposit and is in Ch 7 bankruptcy. Does automatic stay apply?",
    "question": "Landlord claims the security deposit owed me will be discharged in bankruptcy. Everything I've read about this indicates that this is false. This is a black-and-white case, save for the bankruptcy aspect. What can I do to get the security deposit back ASAP?",

        "You need to do an adversary and object to the discharge of the debt. You would file the adversary under 11 USC 523 a (8) off the top of my head, (but look up the statute), for fraud as a fiduciary. A landlord is a fiduciary of your security deposit and has to have it in a separate account accruing interest in most states. If he didn't do that he breached his fiduciary duty. There is a deadline to object to the discharge and you are going to pay a fee to file it and you may need an attorney.",
        "In many states (I can't speak for California), a security deposit is held in trust by the landlord for the the benefit of the tenant. If the landlord failed to follow the law to keep a security deposit separate, he could be considered to have committed fraud. The resulting debt would then be non-dischargeable under both 523(a)(2) [fraud] and 523(a)(4) [defalcation by a fiduciary]. Under the Supreme Court's holding in the De La Cruz case, the attorney's fees for successfully prosecuting a non-dischargeability action would also be non-dischargeable.\n\nSo the law is on your side. But, if the landlord doesn't have any money, vindicating your rights might be hollow.",
        "Technically speaking, the security deposit is not part of the bankruptcy estate because it is YOUR money, and therefore, you are not a \"creditor\" in the bankruptcy.\n\nPractically speaking, however, the landlord probably used up all of the tenant security deposits, and you thus would not likely be able to recover it.\n\nYou can make a claim against the bankruptcy estate. Under the Bankruptcy Code, at section 507(a)(7), your claim for your security deposit is a priority claim, which means that you would be paid ahead of general unsecured creditors. But for you to be paid anything, there must be assets in the bankruptcy estate. If the landlord's Chapter 7 bankruptcy case is a \"no-asset case\" (meaning there is no property for the trustee to liquidate), you will not be paid through the bankruptcy.\n\nIf there are no assets to pay you, you might file an adversary proceeding for a determination that the debt is not dischargeable in the bankruptcy. That means, if you win, the landlord would still owe you the money and the debt would not be discharged. An adversary proceeding is a mini lawsuit in the bankruptcy court.",
        "The bankruptcy laws will discharge many claims but not debts incurred through fraud, conversion, embezzlement or willful misconduct. If your lease is with the person who filed bankruptcy (not a corporation, LLC or other entity) then the landlord's bankruptcy will discharge your claim unless you take action. It sounds like you are taking the position the landlord stole your deposit, correct? The legal terminology is that the landlord converted or embezzled the money. In order to avoid having your claim discharged (wiped out forever) you must file a lawsuit in the bankruptcy and prove to the judge that your claim arises from conversion or embezzlement. You must file the proper paperwork within 60 days of the Meeting of Creditors or you will lose your right to contest the bankruptcy. In my opinion, this paperwork will require a lawyer.",

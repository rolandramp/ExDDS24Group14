    "title": "Past HOA dues after receiving chapter 7 discharge.",
    "question": "I was just served for past HOA fees that were incurred after my discharge. The fees due at the time of my BK were discharged. My condo was included in the BK although the bank has not foreclosured yet. It has been one year since my discharge. The HOA filed a lien against me a few months ago, but the BK attorney told me not to worry about it that they could not collect from me. The papers I received said that the HOA can garnish my wages. I am barely making ends meet now and I don't know how to handle this. I don't have the almost $4000 I am being sued for. Can anyone offer advice here? The property is in San Diego but I moved to Simi Valley two years ago for a new job. Thank you.",

        "Assuming that everything was done in your bankruptcy to discharge your HOA obligations and condo loan, then you should not have been sued as that debt was discharged. If you had an attorney for the bankruptcy, you should contact him or her to contact the HOA attorney to let them know that they are violating the court's discharge order. If you had no attorney, you should get a copy of your discharge order and the schedule that showed the HOA and send it to the attorney by certified mail, return receipt, with a cover letter explaining the situation and to dismiss the lawsuit immediately with prejudice and to send you a copy of proof of dismissal. Be sure to keep a copy of your letter and the postal receipts and refer to the Superior Court Case number.\n\nThis is a violation of the discharge order and you are entitled to bring suit in bankruptcy court against the lawyer and the HOA, but if they dismiss voluntarily, then perhaps you can let it slide.

        "Your question highlights the following problem: You will owe post petition HOA dues even though you have filed for bankruptcy. Since banks are sometimes taking a long time to foreclose you may wind up owing a lot of money even though you have declared bankruptcy.\n\nBut I don't see this as a problem The fact that the bank may take many months to foreclose means that you can continue to live in the condo rent free or rent the place out during the time period that the bank is stalling on the foreclosure. Isn't it a good deal to have the use of the condo during this period and all you owe is the HOA dues?",
        "Bankruptcy didn't really resolve this problem, but that doesn't mean you're in as much hot water as you now feel.\n\nI disagree with at least one of the answers offered so far. The HOA dues are obligations which have arisen AFTER the Petition was filed. In my opinion, they are not, and could not have been discharged in the bankruptcy. HOA's and property taxes accruing post-petition are becoming a more common problem these days, since lenders are not nearly as prompt as they used to be in following through with foreclosures, which necessarily cleared title. Attorneys and their clients alike were used to - in the \"good old days\" - counting on the lender foreclosing, the property changing hands, and in that process all outstanding liens were, and would be, resolved so title could pass from the old owner to the new.\n\nProblem is, these days lenders aren't so motivated to pursue the foreclosure remedies. They are overwhelmed, and are having to prioritize which properties to pursue. The good news (yes, there is good news here) is twofold: (1) even though bankruptcy didn't and couldn't deal with post-petition debts, you may be able to get the state court to grant an \"exemption\", since you are having such a hard time making ends meet; and (2) eventually, the lender will foreclose, and those liens will be cleared.\n\nFor additional information, you may visit: http://www.bankruptcy-sandiego.com.

    "title": "Are gold coins and silver coins. Considered \"Jewelry\" in chapter 7 bankruptcy?",
    "question": "Is gold bullion, or silver bullion, gold coins and silver coins. Considered Jewelry under chapter 7 bankruptcy? Anyone, know? In other words, would the exemption applied to Jewelry of say 7,000 dollars, also apply to precious metals?",
    "answers": [
        "Orange County trustees would not consider gold bullion (coins or otherwise) as jewelry, but rather as collectables or other type of asset as their value is derived from the commodity itself not from the artistic expression of fashioning the metal into wearable pieces. I suppose if you were to somehow have a jeweler attach a chain to the coins and they could legitimately could be worn, the classification could be revisited.\nFrankly however, whether the gold is considered jewelry, collectables, or a form of currency, it is likely that an experienced and creative bankruptcy attorney could help find a way to exempt these valuable items so that you could keep them as \"exempt.\" The objective is to disclose the asset, and for the trustee not to sell them, exactly how we exempt them not tremendously important, as long as they're exempt.",
        "Coins are considered as collectibles when the actual value exceeds the face value. Hope this perspective helps.",
        "I believe that you can make a strong argument that the silver and gold are collectables or jewelry - whichever suits you best in regard to the exemptions. However ,in a vacuum, I would say that they are NOT jewelry",
        "Typically jewelry is displayed on the body or clothing. The Trustee may object to a jewelry classification for that reason. You can definitely use your wildcard exemptions on the coins. Be sure to get a through consultation on this. You may not want to file Chapter 7 if you are going to lose assets to the Trustee.",
        "That is a good question! Under Federal Exemptions, there is no specific category for precious metals that aren't jewelry. You could, however, use the wildcard exemption if you do not own a home, or if your home has no equity to exempt. CA may have an exemption that applies to precious metals. Depending on the entire scheme of exemptions and your specific assets, you may be able to use CA exemptions. I would recommend contacting an attorney in CA who will know the CA and federal law and be able to make some recommendations for you. Best of luck.",
        "That is a great question.

But the most important thing is to meet with an attorney as you asking this question means you have not. You care about 2 goals: keeping everything you have equity in and discharging all your debts.

        "You should put the last 4 digits of all account numbers you can find. You should use the last address from the creditors most recent correspondence or their bankruptcy address if they specified one (usually in the fine print on back of statement). My practice is to put down all possible addresses on the \"mailing matrix.\" The court sends out the notices so it doesn't cost you a thing.",
        "You are not required to do so, but if you want to be able to rebuild your credit after bankruptcy, it can help to at least list the last 4 digits so that you can match up the debts listed in your Schedules with the debts on your credit report. Unless you are using a credit report for bankruptcy attorneys, it can be difficult to find the bankruptcy address for each creditor. Hope this perspective helps!",
        "I agree with Mr. Taylor. The more account information you can include about a creditor on your bankruptcy petition the better, but redacting account numbers is acceptable. Be aware that accounts may have been sold to debt buyers with additional account numbers."

    "title": "HELP! I took out a loan without my trustee's permission. What do I do now?",
    "question": "I am 2 years into my Chapter 13 bankruptcy repayment (5 year plan) and without thinking, I took out a $2k shared secure loan from my credit union ONLY because I wanted to start rebuilding my credit! I know this sounds stupid, but I didn't know. What should I do? Pay it off? Call my bankruptcy lawyer? I do not want to get in trouble!",

        "As my colleagues have already stated, taking on additional debt during your Chapter 13 case is prohibited. And they are absolutely right that you need to contact your attorney and disclose this to the Court and Chapter 13 trustee right away with a \"mea culpa.\" In the future, the proper procedure for a Chapter 13 debtor who wants or needs to incur new debt is to file a Motion to Incur Debt that must be approved by the judge in your case. The court will decide whether payments on such new debt will prejudice your other creditors already included in your Chapter 13 plan, even if payments on such debt would be proposed to be paid outside the plan.",
        "You need to let your attorney know IMMEDIATELY. Taking out the loan as you have already figured out definitely was no no. Yes you will have to disclose it to the Trustee but if you immediately pay it back, I doubt you are going to have any problem with either Jan Johnson or Dave Cusick. People make mistakes. They understand that. Given your purpose I don't think you a re going to get more than a finger shaking to not do that again. --Good luck",
        "Call your attorney immediately. This will have to be disclosed to the trustee."

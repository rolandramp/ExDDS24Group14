    "title": "I'm on disability and I'm being sued for driving dui. I cannot afford an attorney. How can I defend myself?",
    "question": "I was driving dui and I served my time for it. The car I was driving was not mine and I was not insured. I came to a slow stop at a stop sign and went through it and was rammed by a speeding car on the passenger side where the car owner sat. Passenger was slightly injured and the car was considered totalled by passenger's insurance company. Police arrived at the accident scene and I was field tested and breathalyzed and I was cuffed and arrested, I was taken away. This being my first offense, I was charged with DUI only and I served my community service time. I am now being sued for a great deal of money (over a quarter million dollars) and I have no insurance to drive (I don't own a car) and I am on disability. How can I defend myself?",

        "It is one thing to have a judgment against you and another for the party to be able to collect on it. The fact that you are on disability indicates to me that the party suing you will likely have a difficult time collecting a judgment against you since usually a disability check cannot be garnished. They would likely have to locate other nonexempt assets. I suggest that you contact a Legal Aid agency in your area and request an appointment to determine if you have any assets that can be taken from you if a judgment is entered against you. If not, the problem does not belong to you, it belongs to the plaintiff's lawyer. Good luck.",
        "You need a civil attorney and possibly a bankruptcy attorney. Call the local law library, the county bar association and legal aid for their advice on representation. Good luck to you. I hope this helps?",
        "This claim against you cannot be discharged in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy case. Bankruptcy is not an option here. Are you being sued by the passenger of the vehicle? Or are you being sued by the other motorist? You stated in your post that you were not insured. What about the car? Did the owner of the vehicle have automobile insurance on that vehicle? If so, then there should be coverage that would go with the vehicle, if you had permission of the named insured to operate the vehicle. If that is the case, this claim should be turned over to the liability insurance carrier at once. If your passenger is suing you over this wreck, you will need to employ an attorney to defend you. Your passenger must prove that your negligence caused his or her injuries.",

Talk to a bankruptcy lawyer.",
        "Unfortunately, there is no public defender type office for defending civil lawsuits. You may want to contact the local bar association for Alameda county to see if they have low cost or pro bono attorneys available to assist you.

        "Sorry to say this but I think you should talk to a local bankruptcy lawyer and see if you can discharge this debt in bankruptcy. Given the DUII, this is a more complicated question than it might otherwise be.\n\nYou are unlikely to find a lawyer willing to defend you for free, and since you were convicted of a DUII and it sounds like a pretty big impact, I don't know of any other options but for to defend yourself and that is not a good idea.",
        "It sounds like your criminal case is not the issue, but is a separate civil case. This would be better directed to an auto accident defense attorney. Was the car owner insured?

        "Talk to your local bar association. Often, many attorneys will take pro bono cases or reduced fee cases, and the bar association can set you up with such attorneys."

    "title": "Do I have to list all debts for summary dissolution or uncontested divorce? Or will the courts look into it and red flag us?",
    "question": "I'm using an online divorce writer and want to do a summary dissolution but I'm not sure about debt. My first wife died and I had 30k in debt taking care of her the last 2 years she was alive. My second wife of 2.5 years, misled me about her mental health and we are divorcing because her bipolar is not good and I've got twin 14 year old sons. She just got out of a mental hospital etc and we have no insurance. The total of the multiple bills is 27k. We have agreed to part ways and she will take responsibility for the hospital debts and I'll take all the other CC debt that I already had and we got while married and unemployed. Her having the debt and having no income will likely get the hospital to write the debt off, unless they still decide to look at my income in considering whether or not too???",

        "Your first mistake is using an \"online divorce writer\" to get this done. Use of family law attorney to get this done correctly. It is probably cheaper then you think. PS. Did you go through the qualifications for a summary divorce? It appears that you might not qualify for a summary judgment on the medical bills alone.",
        "Yes. You must list all debts.\nCalifornia requires full disclosure of all assets and liabilities.",
        "Using a form-filling service is often an invitation to disaster... you get what you pay for. That having been said, failing to disclose is almost always a mistake.",
        "IN California the court always favors full disclosures. Better do it now than having headaches later.",
        "Yes, you must list all debts. The court won't know, but your wife will."

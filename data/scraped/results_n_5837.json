    "title": "Down Payment Assistance from the Federal Government",
    "question": "My daughter and her husband were given $7500 from the Federal Government for Down Payment Assistance when they purchased their home and were on the program that it had to be paid back at the rate of $500 per year through their tax returns. They divorced in 2012 and lost their home to foreclosure. My daughter filed a chapter 7 bankruptcy and the attorney included the Down Payment Assistance in the bankruptcy. Her ex husband did not file bankruptcy however. Since my daughter lost the house and filed bankruptcy, is she still liable for repaying back this assistance through her tax returns or is the debt cleared through either one of these processes? Since it is collected through the IRS, if she is relieved from this debt, how does she make the IRS aware?",

        "I'm not familiar with \"down payment assistance programs\" (now there's an oxymoron for you) so I can't say for sure ... but another possibility is that the IRS has a lien on future tax refunds. The debt has been discharged, to be sure, but such a lien would not be avoidable because it is voluntary.",

        "You have posted this question under the heading of Federal Government Contracts, however your question would more appropriately be answered in the Bankrutpcy forum, since your question really involves the dischargeability of your daughter's IRS debt in her Chapter 7 bankruptcy. Therefore I have changed teh practice area for you to Bankruptcy.\n\nIn answer to your question, I'm sure other bankruptcy attorneys that will respond to this might have more detailed information, since I have not dealt with this specific issue before, but I believe so long as the debt was properly scheduled, and the IRS were listed as a creditor, then the debt will probably be discharged. However there are many factors that could affect this, such as whether the IRS recorded the debt as a lien against the property. If so, then the debt would be similar to a tax lien recorded against the property and it would have \"run with the land\" and gone away through the foreclosure process. As far as making the IRS aware, they should have been scheduled in the bankruptcy petition as a creditor and been given notice by the bankruptcy court. If not, and your daughter's BK is still open, I would have her BK attorney amend the schedules and the mailing matrix to add the IRS."

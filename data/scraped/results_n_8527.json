You might be better off converting your case to C13 or even dismiss it. Both convert ion or dismissal are generally easily. Bankruptcy and particularly C13 should not be handled without either representation by an experienced bankruptcy attorney who practices in the area where your case is pending or at least advice by such an attorney before taking any action in the case. Mistakes are costly in bankruptcy as much as in other legal cases or, in my opinion more, and without competent recommendation or advice your likely to make serious mistakes."

        "I agree with Attorney Rodgers' response. Your cousin will not have to qualify for a loan in order to get title to the house. However, before your cousin's kids continue to make the payments, she should consult with an attorney to make sure she does have title, because your question does not indicate how your aunt passed title to your cousin. Was there a will or a living trust?",
        "The mortgage loan needs to be paid timely every month in order to prevent a foreclosure. You didn't say how it was that yor aunt left the home toyour cousin, but I presume it is by a will and that your cousin, or someone, has opened a probate. If the house was an outright gift and does not have to be sold in order to distribute assets or pay debts, then your cousin can take possession of the house and make the payments from whatever source of income she has. She doesn't have to assume the loan or qualfiy with the bank in order to have legal title to the property. She will get legal title by order of the probate court. If she just makes the payments on time, keeps the taxes and insurance paid and current, chances are the loan servicer will not care - the loan has probaby been securitized and sold many times to large Wall Street investors. All they want usually is just regular timely payments. To verify this, your cousinn should take the mortgage note, if she can find it, and the probate papers, if any, to a real estate attorney for a consultation.\n.\n\nRichard A. Rodgers, Esq.

    "title": "How to avoid problems with an estate inheritance when there are debts involved?",
    "question": "Situation: A friend's parent died. The parent had a house with two mortgages, and died with medical debts. The parent lived in San Diego, her only surviving son does not. He does not have much money. He does not want to deal with it, really--he is not interested in the house, which is ramshackle and in poor condition. He has no connection to the house, he is not a co-signer or anything. He does not even want to travel to SD to deal with the situation. He doesn't know much about the law or how debts work, though I have told him he can't inherit debts, especially if he is not interested in becoming owner of the house (he is not.)",

        "If he truly doe not want to handle this, he can nominate someone to do it for him. Could be a friend like you, or possibly a professional fiduciary. It doesn't have to be him, and they woudn't be paid by him, but by the estate at the end of the processl If the estate is worth administering, his roll can be to sit back and wait for the final distribution. He needs do little more. The threshold question would be if there is enough equity above the mortgages to bother doing anything. The medical debts are less of a concern to getting the estate administered, and can often be very successfully dealt with. The process would begin with someone setting an appointment with an experienced probate attorney in San Diego. They can help chart the best way forward, There may be better options than he thinks.",
        "He can hire an attorney who will be paid from the estate at the end of the probate. The attorney should handle everything so he will not have to go to San Diego. He will not be personally liable for the debts. Any debts will be paid from proceeds from the sale of the house. Basically he can hire an attorney with no out of pocket costs or liability so he should use the Find a Lawyer tab and hire one as soon as he is ready.",
        "He can do nothing. He will receive nothing . He will have no liability.\nYes. Estate lawyer can handle entire administration for reasonable fee.\nProbably not. There is no apparent need for son to travel to San Diego. Estate attorney can handle it for him.\nHe can retain an attorney to to complete administration of the estate in his absence.\nNo. Based on information provided, he is not responsible for deceased parent debts."

    "title": "Can I sue the bank for negligence?",
    "question": "I fell for an online romance scam which scammers instructed me to wire over 240K to various banks in the USA and Turkey. I immediately filed a report on www.ic3.org and reported to my bank and asked them to recover the money for me once I found out it was a scam. The bank just sent me a message saying that \"the attempt to recover the funds was not successful. We now consider this inquiry closed...\". I feel the bank should and could have taken stricter procedures to protect me. I am in a terrible situation now since half of the funds was borrowed and I need help desperately. Do I have a case against my bank?",
    "answers": [
        "Sorry for the predicament you find yourself in. But sometimes the consequences of a decision have severe implications. In your case, clearly you did not conduct any due diligence. It certainly is not the bank's conduct that cause your injury. I would also be very cautious about filing a lawsuit against the bank, they have an army of attorneys and you may end up paying their attorney the fees incurred for defending a frivolous lawsuit.",
        "If half the money was borrowed and you file BK, the person or lender will not get paid. If you borrowed money from family and file BK this might have broader implications. If you do file, remember, BK is more than checking boxes on forms you find online. Find/consult/hire a lawyer using the Avvo feature \"Find a Lawyer\".

        "File bankruptcy. It’s the only way you’re going to get out of debt, here.",
        "Anyone can sue anyone, but I don't like your chances of success.\n\nI agree with Attorney Areshenko. Your story is extraordinary, so it requires extraordinary proof, and even then, you've posted no grounds for the bank's duty to protect you from your own gullability.\n\nBorrowing money for a romance, let alone one in Turkey. is extremely irresponsible, so I hope whoever lent you over $100K got some security for that loan.\n\nYou may want to consult bankruptcy counsel.",
        "You have not said any facts indicating they were negligent. The bank has only a limited duty to safeguard you from your own decisions. I see where you were very negligent, but not the bank. You can hire an attorney to review case as there are few details in your post. Expect to pay the attorney by the hour.\nAlso, expect the person from whom you borrowed the money to be very skeptical you were scammed but instead suspect you are trying to hide the money."

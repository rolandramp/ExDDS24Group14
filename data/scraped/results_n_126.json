        "When a person asks a question like this, I think there may be some underlying set of circumstances that are not being told. Why would you think that one of your creditors has the factual basis to contest your bankruptcy? As indicated, the 341a process is one thing, the objection to discharge is something different. Most attorneys are not obligated to represent a debtor in a 523 or 727 action without a subsequent retainer. Have this discussion with your attorney.",
        "The short answer is: you will not incur any atty fees if a creditor appears at your 341a Meeting of Creditors. As said by my colleagues, the trustee will intervene if the creditors gets off course. You may incur atty fees if a creditor successfully challenges the discharge of its debt as allowed by 11 USC ยง523 for committing a so-called \"bankruptcy crime\".

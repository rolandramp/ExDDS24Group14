        "If you voluntarily left the premises there really is no rational that would support your position in regard to a forced move out unless she was destroying the property or causing harm or damage in some way.

        "If community property, the first issue is whether or not one has exclusive possession. Without a court order, either party may use the residence (or both concurrently). Also, if both have an interest in the property, the interest generally is \"undivided\" meaning both persons may have the use and enjoyment of the other property and allow its reasonable use by others with their permission. However, the person in possession is responsible to pay you 1/2 of the rental value of the property while the case is proceeding (regardless of who is living there). Likewise, if the property is community, you are responsible for 1/2 of the monthly mortgage obligation if there is a mortgage. If the mortgage is greater than the rental value, this will work against you. If the rental value is greater than the mortgage, you are accruing a claim each month that needs to be considered at trial or settlement.",
        "If the house is a community property asset, then you have a right to a CP reimbursement for half the fair rental market value. You need to make sure you get from your ex copies of all rents received while the divorce is pending. Please seek legal assistance on this. You will need to make sure you declare this on your Preliminary Declaration of Disclosure and/or Final Declaration of Disclosure."

    "title": "Hi, I would like to remove myself as a beneficiary to a trust my family set up in CA and the family member wont help.",
    "question": "I reluctantly signed some paperwork back in the 1995 that listed myself as 1 of 2 siblings that were the beneficiaries of a trust a family member set up for my grandmother's assets. The assets at the time were used to purchase a boat which has now lost so much value that it is worth nothing. I am concerned that when the family member passes my family and I will be left to deal with the financial obligation of the boat and or the expense in disclaiming my interest. Any advice as to whether this should be a concern and or where to find the paper to disclaim would be helpful. Thank you!",

        "Unfortunately you are unable to amend your grandmother's trust - only she (or in some situations a POA) can amend to remove you as beneficiary. I agree with my colleague that you will not be personally liable for the debt. A named beneficiary is never forced to accept an inheritance and as you have accurately stated - you can disclaim your share. As far as the possibility of your children (should you have any) now having to in-turn disclaim - this is not necessarily the case unless the trust does in fact state they are to take in your place- your gift may lapse or be given to sibling 2… this would be found in the context of the trust.",
        "Your personal assets will not be liable for the debts incurred by your grandmother, or on her behalf. If all the assets are eaten up by creditors, and debts remain, the creditors will not be able to come after you unless you have already received gifts from your grandmother, in which case the creditor might think it worth pursuing you. But unless you have received gifts or otherwise agreed to pay your grandmother's bills, I cannot see how you would be liable for her debts. Nevertheless, you can execute a \"disclaimer\" but if you have children that will only pass the gift to them, most likely. You need to see an elder law or trust attorney for advice.",

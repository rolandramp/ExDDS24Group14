        "I concur with my colleagues. If your debtor filed BK then you will likely not be able to go forward with any collection efforts and you will need to go through their bankruptcy filing, if appropriate. You can give the \"bankruptcy attorney\" you mention a call and speak with him/her about the status of your debtor.",
        "As the judgment creditor/plaintiff in the $5K case, you are trying to get the debtor to answer financial questions so you can collect your judgment. If your debtor filed BK, you, as a creditor are not allowed to continue with your debtor exam. You need to verify whether or not your debtor filed BK. If so, you must pursue your remedies in the bankruptcy forum. You should immediately find/consult/hire a lawyer using the Avvo feature \"Find a Lawyer\". Make a list of 4-5 having many 5 star reviews from satisfied clients. If you don't get a prompt call back from one, go on to the next on your list. contact. This is serious and not the time for you to \"play lawyer\".",
        "I assume that this is the First Meeting of Creditors. There will be no judge present. The first things that will come up is the selection / confirmation of the Bankruptcy Trustee. Usually this is not an issue. Then you and about a hundred people will set around while the Trustee questions each debtor. You will have the opportunity to ask questions of the debtor about his/her assets and financial affairs. No decisions will be made but you might learn that the debtor has a lot of bills and no non-exempt assets."

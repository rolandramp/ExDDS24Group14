    "title": "What is the difference between a Marital Settlement agreement and a Stipulated Judgment",
    "question": "I asked my attorney to prepare a MSA that my husband and I agreed to. My attorney prepared a Stipulated Judgment. I want to know what the differnce is but I can't ask him because it seems that he has turned on me. He nor his staff will return any of my calls and he does not answer my e-mail. He said in his last e-mail that I should schedule a face to face meeting with him but at $375.00 I don't need a face to face with him. He has actually turned into my nitemare! It's too late to fire him and if I do I would have to pay him $795.00 just to fire him and I would have to start over with another attorney. I don't think I want to do that either because it was almost impossible to get my husband to sign the Stipulated Judgment and I don't want to go through that again.",

        "So long as the operative terms of the Stipulated Judgment are the settlement terms that the parties agreed to, your attorney's preparing a Stipulated Judgment reduced the amount of work (and fees) needed to bring the case to a conclusion. Where the parties enter a written Marital Settlement Agreement, some (but not all) counties allow the MSA to be attached to the Judgment form, which, when the Judge signs the Judgment form, the MSA becomes the operative terms of the Judgment. In a county where that is not the policy followed by the Courts, a Judgment needs to be prepared, and if the Judgment is a Stipulated Judgment, it is not necessary to engage in the additional prior step of preparing and entering an MSA. Make peace with your lawyer and save attorney's fees.",
        "You should probably meet with your lawyer to review and make sure you understand the provisions of your agreement. Even though you are reluctant to see him again, he is probably the best place to get your questions answered.\n\nIn any event, a Marital Settlement Agreement is actually a contract that sets forth the various agreements between you and your former (or soon to be former) spouse. Typically, it contains your agreements about how you are splitting your assets and debts, how you will pay or receive child support and spousal support (if any), and related items such as what reimbursements each of you are making or receiving, etc. It may also include your agreement about how you are sharing parenting responsibilities. It is a stand-alone agreement that can be enforced pursuant to its terms. A Stipulated Judgment typically contains the same agreements. Indeed, it is common in many counties to include a copy of the Marital Settlement Agreement as part of the Judgment. when that is done, or when the terms are all spelled out in a Stipulated Judgment, the agreements become the order of the court and are enforceable by the court through contempt actions or other orders requiring one party or the other to perform as ordered in the agreement.\n\nMany practitioners prefer a Stipulated Judgment when there may be a fairly high likelihood that the court will need to enforce some of the provisions, because many believe that it is easier to enforce a court order than it is to enforce the contract.",
        "A marital settlement agreement is a \"private\" document between the parties. The terms need to be then placed in a Stipulated Judgment in order to be signed by the judge and enforeceable. Your lawyer sounds very odd."

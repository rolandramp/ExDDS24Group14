    "question": "I included my pre-filing HOA debt in my filing, but the HOA did not file a proof of claim. Therefore, the trustee did not include payments to the HOA in the plan approved by the judge. Do I still owe the debt to the HOA? What can I do to cancel that debt?",

        "If you are represented by an attorney, your attorney should have filed a claim on the HOA's behalf because that debt will survive the bankruptcy if it does not get paid through the plan. In many jurisdictions you can seek permission from the court to file a late claim and still resolve this, although it may result in an increased plan payment for you.",
        "I agree with Attorney Corbin, and would just add that you can, as a chapter 13 debtor, file a proof of claim on behalf of the creditor. If you do so, they will get paid, but if you are late in your Chapter 13 plan there could be significant funding issues on your plan. You should certainly talk to your attorney to get all of those details.",
        "I believe the pre-petition HOA will be discharged. If you wanted to pay the arrearage your attorney should have included it under real estate arrears, in which case a claim would not have been necessary.The trustee does not devise your plan, you do. You are of course responsible for paying all post-petition HOA fees directly (outside your plan). Did you discuss this question with your attorney?",
        "This is a tough call because, technically, if you're in a 13 plan and a creditor does not file a proof of claim, then their claim isn't paid. BUT, the HOA will still have a lien on the property, and they won't release it until they're paid. You'd have to litigate that issue separately with the bankruptcy court and see if you could convince a judge to strip the lien from the property (doubtful). Speak with your bankruptcy attorney.",
        "There is a lot of debate about this with different attorneys from various parts of the country. But, based on where you filed, IF, the HOA did not file a lien, their pre-petition arrears are unsecured and will be discharged. If they filed a lien, their lien will survive, so you will need to speak to your attorney whether, based on the unprotected equity in your property, you can strip off the lien. Good luck!"

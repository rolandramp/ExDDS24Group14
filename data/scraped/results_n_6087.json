        "In order to allege that you are entitled to an unsecured payment based on some type of fraud/theft, you need to commence an adversary proceeding in order to get an order from a bankruptcy judge providing such. Depending on the laws in your jurisdiction, this may or may not consitute an additional priority claim--though it may just be a general unsecured claim None the unless, until this is adjudicated, nothing prevents you from attaching additional pages to the official proof of claim form where you set forth the 3 areas of your claim, as well as the total amount (if known) of the claim.\n\nBecause it sounds like your proof of claim will require the filing of an adversary complaint and/or elicit an objection, you really should discuss the matter in more detail with a bankruptcy attorney in your area.",

        "The unreturned security deposit is a clear-cut issue - if it was due to be returned, it should be a priority claim. The other claims, however, are not \"claims\" in that there is a determined amount of held money that you should have gotten back - you will have to sue the landlord via an adversary proceeding and have the bankruptcy court determine whether or not you are entitled to anything on those issues - just like a regular lawsuit. If you win, then your award would be rendered non-dischargable. That said, just because something is a priority claim or rendered non-dischargable does not mean you'll ever collect. You need to hire a bankruptcy attorney ASAP to ensure your adversary proceeding is filed within the short window in which to do it.",
        "A Proof of Claim is not a proceeding to determine whether a debt is dischargeable. You need to file an adversary proceeding. What you Proof of Claim will get you is the right to some portion of the assets to which the Trustee comes into possession. If the Trustee does not receive any assets, your Proof of Claim will get you nothing, and your claim will be discharged by the bankruptcy."

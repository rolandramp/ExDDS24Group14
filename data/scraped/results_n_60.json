    "title": "How do I get rid of this?",
    "question": "An LLC my wife and I created has been named (erroneously) in a lawsuit with like 80 other LLC's in which there are a ton with similar names to ours. We don't know the plaintiff and due to covid, we never did anything under the LLC anyway. I feel like they just grabbed some names are are hoping it sticks. I've received a summons and have contacted the attorney of the plaintiff who told me he'd look into it but since has kept sending us documents and is now no longer returning my calls. What can I do so I don't have to go to court and I can get our LLC/name off this suit?",

    "answers": [
        "I agree with colleagues and add:\nYour attorney will need to sort through pleadings and determine whether you are a proper party or case of mistaken identity..\nYour attorney can then take appropriate action to respond and get you out of case or present defense.\nDo not ignore service. You may be defaulted if you fail to respond.",
        "I'm a little more optimistic than my colleagues and speculate that if you hire a lawyer to contact the plaintiff's lawyer, you can get your LLC dismissed before you need to file an Answer.\n\nIt's also the case that plaintiff should contact any defaulting defendant before they request entry of default, so you may have a little more time to get this resolved. but if more than a few weeks has gone by since your LLC was 1st served and you ARE getting default documents, hire a lawyer immediately,",
        "IMO it borders on frivolous to just sue everyone. You need a lawyer to represent the LLC but you should discuss filing for sanctions against the plaintiff.",
        "The LLC is required to appear in court which means you have to hire an attorney to represent it. Sorry, but that is one of the risks that you took when you decided to form an LLC. You may try hiring an attorney to simply draft a demand letter which may or may not get the plaintiffs attorney to act more seriously."

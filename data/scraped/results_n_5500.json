        "Pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure section 706.105, subdivision (b), a judgment creditor who desires to contest a claim of exemption must, within 10 days after the date of the mailing of the notice of claim of exemption, file with the levying officer a notice of opposition to the claim of exemption.\n\nFor a list of exemptions, see:\n\nhttp://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/ej155.pdf\n\nThe exemption claimant bears the burden of proof at the hearing. (CCP § 703.580(b).) However, the exemption statutes are liberally construed in favor of the claimant. (See Independence Bank v. Heller (1969) 275 Cal.App.2d 84, 88.) The burden of applying for and proving that the wages are exempt is on the debtor who knows best what is “necessary for the use” of his family. (See Raigoza v. Sperl (1973) 34 Cal.App.3d 560, 568.) There are, however, no statutory guidelines or definitions for what is “necessary for the support” of a judgment debtor or his family, nor for what are “common necessaries of life.” The determination of what is “necessary” for the support of the judgment debtor or his family differs with each debtor. Many things may be within the meaning of a “necessary for support.” The term “common necessaries of life” means essentials commonly required by all persons for the sustenance of life, whatever their employment status and includes medical care. (J. J. MacIntyre Co. v. Duren (1981) 118 Cal.App.3d Supp. 16, 18 – 19.)\n\nThe court's decision may be based solely on the information in the claim of exemption and notice of opposition (which are deemed to controvert each other); or the court may continue the hearing for production of other oral or documentary evidence. (CCP § 703.580(c).) The court must make an order determining whether the property is exempt, in whole or in part. The court need not make any findings. (CCP § 703.580(d).",

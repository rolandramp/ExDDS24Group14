    "title": "Must I list my assets on a Divorce Petition?",
    "question": "I got married at an early age in the 80's when I lived in NJ. I moved to California and never looked back. I have not spoken to my husband for almost 25 years. We both were young and just moved on. I never filed for divorce and according to the clerk in NJ, he didn't either. On the petition it says Community or Separate assets and I am not sure if I have to list everything I have and if it is \"community property.\" I also think I have an address for him so I am going to try to serve him there.",
    "answers": [
        "Sadly, because you never filed, everything acquired over the past 25 years is presumably community. I would definitely seek counsel, understand the law of New Jersey and explore your options. On the petition you can simply say \"TBD.\" Make sure your date of separation is accurate, that will be critical. Hope that helps!",
        "The first issue I see is whether California will have jurisdiction to do anything except terminate the status of your marriage, which I think is what you want. You do not say where he lives currently and give no other information about what contacts he may have had with California over the years. You are going to allege a date of separation as close to the date you actually separated so it is likely the property you have now is your separate property in any event. If this court has no jurisdiction over the division of property because it does not have in personam jurisdiction over him you should be able to check box 10.a. on the Petition that says there are no assets or debts that you know of to be divided and you may be able to have a lawyer file a motion relieving you of having to serve an Income and Expense Declaration and Asset and Debt Schedule so you can declare that you did to comply with the requirement for filing preliminary and final declarations of disclosure based on this court's lack of jurisdiction to do anything except terminate status. This is a more interesting question than you might have thought. At least a consultation with a lawyer will likely save you money and there is no question it will save you aggravation.",
        "If you don't list them on the petition you will need to list them on a form titled FL-160 and check the box for separate property. Full disclosure of all assets and debts/liabilities is a must under CA law. You can't serve him yourself. You should talk to a family law attorney about doing this right.",
        "Good practice requires you to clearly list and identify both your community and separate property. It sounds like there is zero community, so it benefits you to claim separate property in your initial filing. I have never understood filings that say things like \"I am unaware of what my assets are and will tell you later\".",
        "You don't need to list your assets on the petition. It us probably safe to check the paragraph that says \"there are no community assets or debts to divide.\""

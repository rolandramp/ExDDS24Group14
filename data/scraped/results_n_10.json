    "title": "Should I try to work out a judgment payback agreement, before considering bankruptcy?",
    "question": "I’m trying to work out a payback agreement to make 4 lump sum payments ($2,500 once a year for 4 years) on a 5 year old 10K judgment (for credit card default), before I consider bankruptcy. Currently the bank’s lawyer have a lien on my house. Should I try to work out a deal without telling the bank’s lawyer I’m considering bankruptcy or should I tell the bank’s lawyer I’m considering bankruptcy? If I can work out a payback agreement with the lawyer, I will not need to consider bankruptcy. I \"DO\" want to do the right thing and pay it off, now that I have a realistic plan to pay it off and now that I have some financial means to pay it off. Lastly, since they have a lien on my house, I’m wondering what troubles that could cause while trying to work out a deal with the bank’s lawyer?",

        "As you can see, great attorneys in CA have already answered you. And we see their informative answers all the time here on AVVO and know you can see one and obtain that much needed advice. None can seek you to call them. So you take the initiative and read their reviews and act. The attorney will also want to know the FMV of house, the $ owed on mortgages, any other secured liens on home, if you own 100% or not, how long ago you bought it and source of monies etc. as many issues must be looked at to answer what you might seem is a simple question. I do know NO creditor can say \"yes\" to an offer to resolve it if you do not ask too. Call a CA attorney here on AVVO now.\n\nYour asking that question implies you have not called and discussed with an experienced bankruptcy attorney near you as you would or should know the answer to that question posted here on AVVO. Other facts and issues can gravely affect your case so I will point these out for you next some issues so you know you only need to do one thing now: call an attorney near you to discuss bankruptcy. You need and want to enjoy your fresh start also. But the most important thing is to meet with an attorney as you asking this question means you have not. You care about 2 goals: keeping everything you have equity in and discharging all your debts. If you don't have any of the exceptions to discharge you will obtain that goal; most exceptions are set forth in 11 USC. 523 (Google it) like child support, some income taxes, traffic (in a ch 7) and criminal fines , and presumption of student loans. But some debts are dischargeable in a ch 13 but NOT in a ch 7 so you want to make sure and your attorney will discuss any such types with you also!\n\nYour exemptions depend on what state you have lived in in the last 2 years and thus if in your state, then your states exemptions will apply. Most persons filing keep everything they own but your attorney will confirm that with you when they learn everything you own and the equity thereof!\n\nSome secured debts like homes, vehicles, other secured debts an attorney will discuss your options on also as you must list any debts; but that does not mean you will lose them unless you have too much equity or are in default on paying for them! Discuss those options if they apply with your attorney too.\n\nBut other issues can arise that can greatly harm your case. Just one example: If you paid back a relative $3,000 11 months ago and now file bankruptcy next week, the trustee can SUE that relative to retrieve that $3,000 (under what is called a preference) for the benefit of the bankruptcy estate. As a result, most attorneys don't charge to meet with them the first meeting so meet with one no matter what.\n\nMany great attorneys can be found right here on AVVO in your state so look, call, and meet one as soon as you can.\n\nYou should also want to know when to file: is there an advantage of waiting versus filing now and who should you pay between now and then! Good luck and enjoy your later fresh start.",
        "You have received many on-point responses. There is a great deal to consider before approaching the creditor. Raising \"bankruptcy\" in the process of a settlement or payment arrangement is not the best approach to take. I urge you to seek direct advice from an experienced bankruptcy attorney to discuss all aspects of the settlement option and bankruptcy.",
        "To add to the other answers. I had an older client who had enough money to pay my fee to file a BK. I told the bank that he would send that amount to the bank for settlement or to me. The bank rejected the offer. I got the money.",
        "With the new equity exemption amounts, your BK lawyer likely can avoid the judgment lien. Depending on the total amount of your debt and assets, BK is probably your best and least expensive judgment. You will not get any success just \"threatening bankruptcy\".\n\nFind/consult/hire a lawyer in your area using the Avvo feature \"Find a Lawyer\". Make a list of 4-5 having many 5 star reviews from satisfied clients. If you don't get a prompt call back from one, go on to the next on your list. Some offer a free consultation by phone or in person. Take us up on it.\n\nBecause the bankruptcy process can be handled entirely by phone, email and fax, there is no need to personally visit the lawyer’s office unless you want to. Don’t be limited by the location of the BK lawyers you select.",
        "As stated in the above responses, threatening with a possible bankruptcy does not hold alot of weight. A judgment may not simply be able to removed in bankruptcy. Also, you need an attorney to negotiate for you since your proposal is not very appealing to creditors whom already have a judgement accruing interest. Speak to an attorney that does this on a daily basis.",
        "I regularly meet with clients that feel the same way that you do. But in order to be effective, you need be able to engage in, what I call an \"exercise in dialectical thinking\". That is, looking at the situation from the opposing person's (in this case the bank with a judgment lien on your home) point of view.\n\nYou should know that merely \"threatening\" to file for bankruptcy is a common gesture used in debt negotiations with creditors. This gambit generally gives poor results for two reasons: first, it's too general in nature for the lien creditor to take seriously and second, few lawyers **REALLY** understand bankruptcy law and what can be accomplished through it. For instance, it is possible to \"strip off\" a \"judicial lien\" to the extent that it \"impairs an exemption\" under the Bankruptcy Code. What do you think that means? Don't know? I'm not surprised. But you're in good company; even many attorneys that represent creditors have little idea what that means as a practical matter or how to actually go about doing it.\n\nWhat I STRONGLY recommend is that you spend the money to speak with a KNOWLEDGEABLE bankruptcy attorney (a specialist, not a lawyer that does \"bankruptcy\" as just one of many areas of law he or she practices) in your locale. It will be money well-spent. A really good bankruptcy specialist may be able to do a MUCH BETTER job negotiating terms with your lien creditor without having to file a bankruptcy case for you, precisely because the attorney representing the bank will know PRECISELY what will happen if no agreement is reached.\n\nThere are MANY good knowledgeable bankruptcy attorneys here on Avvo. Look CAREFULLY at their credentials, read their reviews, look over their legal experience and cases, look at their sub-specializations (consumer vs. commercial, debtor vs. creditor work, etc.) before deciding on reaching out to anyone. BE PICKY!! You want a consultation with a professional, not an interview with a \"salesman\" with \"discount pricing\".\n\nI wish you the very best of luck in your endeavors! I remain . . .\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nAttorney Richard N. Gottlieb",
        "Well whether you should consider bankruptcy as an option sort of depends on how much other debt you have and whether you intend to sell your home anytime soon. Hope this perspective helps!",
        "You should consult with a bankruptcy attorney in your area before signing the agreement to review all your options. Bankruptcy may be an option, but the lien on the house certainly complicates things because it will not disappear in bankruptcy without a motion to avoid the lien which will increase your bankruptcy fees."

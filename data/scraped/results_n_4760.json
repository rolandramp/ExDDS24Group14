        "Congrats on your engagement. If you were to marry your U.S. citizen boyfriend, and you entered the U.S. legally with a student visa, then you are eligible to adjust status in the U.S. As for the affidavit of support, the USCIS will require the most recent tax return of your petitioner husband, along with evidence of current employment. If this demonstrated income is at least 125% of the poverty guideline for your household size, then that ends the inquiry. The USCIS and the I-864 does not require an evaluation of all debts of the petitioner, nor is one's credit history relevant. If your petitioner husband's income is not sufficient, then you can include a \"joint sponsor\" with your application. Again, the debt status or credit history of the joint sponsor will not be evaluated by USCIS.",
        "See form I-864P",
        "I understand things a bit differently than Jeff on this one. You entered on an F1 visa and are out of status. In this situation, a provisional waiver should not be needed. As for the income issue, generally debts are not considered, except perhaps a tax lien based on court judgment. Also, there can be times when the sponsor's overall financial condition places doubt on his ability to maintain stable earnings. He likely will qualify based on what you wrote, but you should consult privately with a licensed U.S. immigration attorney. I've included a link below regarding income requirements."

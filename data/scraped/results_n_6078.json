    "title": "I just received a Writ Of Execution (Money Judgment), what might happen now?",
    "question": "Long story short, I rightfully had a $3,100 credit card judgment issued against me in February 2012. Nothing happened further until the credit card company's lawyer put a lien on my house in September 2012. Today a Writ Of Execution arrived in the mail. It basically talks about the JC seeks to levy upon my property, but the Writ is not for a sale. Yet it states that I may claim any available exemptions for my property within 15 days once the notice was mailed to me. Yet states if my property is levied upon, then I have up to 120 days (after the notice) to have an opportunity to settle with the JC before my house can be levied upon.",

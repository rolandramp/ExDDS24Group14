    "question": "Hi, My wife had a car accident (not at fault) in 2007 and was injured. we filed chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2008. Less than a year after the bankruptcy we recieved a settlement from the insurance that we did not expected. And was never disclosed at the time of bankruptcy because we are not ask about any accident. Sorry we don't know anything about legal stuff and no dollar amount was involved during bankruptcy. Is the trustee have the right to consider this as fraud and take all the money?",

        "If you did not Schedule the claim, and exempt as much as you could, the trustee has the right and obligation to pursue those funds for the benefit of your creditors. Even though your case is discharged there is no time limit for the trustee to pursue assets. Did you have a lawyer, or did you do this yourself? Schedule B clearly asks for contingent and unliquidated claims. I have never had a meeting of creditors where the trustee did not ask if there are any claims.

        "If you had a bankruptcy attorney represent you for your Chapter 7, you should contact him or her immediately with this development. Possibly your petition can be amended to properly disclose this on the schedules and you can apply any exemptions to it so that you get to keep the amount that is properly exempted, perhaps all of it, since you did not mention how much you received or what exemptions were exhausted in your Petition. If no previous attorney, contact a bankruptcy attorney to amend your asset schedule, if he or she determines it is necessary.\n\nLess to everyone else: disclose every asset that is a \"contingency\" on the petition, because to complete the bankruptcy, the trustee and the court will most likely release these to you, to complete the case and then you can keep all of it and not worry about it, if it turns out the asset is worth something.",
        "This is a question you need to address to a bankruptcy lawyer, but since your wife's claim for injuries (a cause of action, or asset) occurred prior to the filing of the bankruptcy, it should have been listed as an asset in the BK filing. I believe the trustee could re-open the discharge, depending on the size of the settlement, if any creditor petitioned him to do so."

    "question": "I am scared and do not know what to do. I have other debt collectors trying to collect as well and have mounting student loans to pay off as well. How do I respond to their summons and would a bankruptcy attorney be my best option or should I hire a debt settlement attorney to help me negotiate? I have paid off one collector but have 3 more to answer to. In total my unsecured debt to around $12,000. Any advice would be much appreciate.",

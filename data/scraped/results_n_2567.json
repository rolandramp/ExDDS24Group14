        "Sometimes the \"dental bill\" some persons describe is not a one time thing but work over a period of time. The portion of the bill for after filing for work post petition, the dentist can enter into a new contract for post petition work in case it is that type of \"bill\". Some persons use the word dentist for orthodontic type work. Otherwise, you could ALSO still incur the bill,if you have money to pay it later such as in the 2 weeks following bankruptcy and if you pay with post petition income or exempt assets and do so that would obviously support your mental intent of not defrauding but in fact paying. Good luck..the Other answers otherwise already discuss this in depth.",
        "I just answered your question literally an hour ago.\n\nYou do not have to ask it several times. Here is the previous answer. I think everyone agrees its a magnanimously foolish idea.\n\nWhat will happen is that the dentist will object to your discharge on the grounds that you had no intention to pay.\n\nRunning up debt right before filing for bankruptcy, typically within 60 days of filing, constitutes an abuse to which the creditor may object.

        "You should not intentionally run up any bill before filing bankruptcy. The creditor may object and/or the court could deny your discharge. There's a difference between inuring a large medical bill and that being the impetus for filing bankruptcy (generally okay), as opposed to deciding to file bankruptcy and then deciding \"hey why I just go ahead and charge this other stuff first.\" You may want to consult an attorney in person as there is a lot to be said on this topic, but a lot most attorneys wont discuss in an open forum, where they may be misinterpreted as encouraging improper conduct.\n\nRob T.",
        "If you know for certain that you are filing for bankruptcy, then getting major dental work prior to filing (and not paying for it) will most likely imply fraud. The dentist can file to object to the discharge of that debt; in addition, the US Trustee's office could file a Motion claiming bad faith and seeking denial of your discharge.\n\nIf you do intend to pay for the dental work regardless of the bankruptcy discharge, you can explain your plan to the dentist, and work out a payment arrangement. Disclosure and honesty are the best policy!\n\nIt's really not worth the risk of having your discharge denied, or being left responsible for the debt after your bankruptcy case is discharged."

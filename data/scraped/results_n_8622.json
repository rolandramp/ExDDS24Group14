    "title": "Can a bank freeze my corporate business checking account if I file personal BK Chp 7?",
    "question": "I am looking at filing Chapter 7 bankruptcy in the next few weeks. I have read about Wells Fargo being notorious for freezing checking accounts when filing BK (even if you don't have debt with them). I have a corporate business account with Wells Fargo. My business is an S Corp (in California). Would they be able to freeze my corporate checking account if I filed personal bankruptcy?",

        "Banks track accounts by tax identification numbers, not names. If your S Corporation account with Wells Fargo Bank is linked to your personal account, or if your Social Security number is associated with the corporate account, you can expect Wells Fargo to freeze the account. That Wells Fargo continues to pursue such a policy is unfathomable. In a recent decision, In re Mwangi, --- B.R. ----, 2010 WL 2723204, 10 Cal. Daily Op. Serv. 8939, 9th Cir.BAP (Nev.), June 30, 2010, the Ninth Circuit Bankruptcy Appellate Panel held that Wells Fargo's national policy of placing an administrative freeze on Debtors' bank accounts when they file a bankruptcy petition violates the automatic stay by exercising control over property of the Debtor's bankruptcy estate in violation of Bankruptcy Code section 362(a)(3).\n\nThe case was remanded to the trial court to determine the amount of damages to assess against Wells Fargo. Yet, at this point, Wells Fargo continues the policy, perhaps because it is seeking further review of the Mwangi decision in the hope the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reverses or the United States Supreme Court agrees to hear the case. Until Wells Fargo reverses its policy, all that one can do is avoid Wells Fargo like the plague. Maybe now is the time to get to know a small, regional bank that wants your business, not one that is “too big to fail” like Wells Fargo, which received $25 Billion in TARP funds at the expense of U.S. taxpayers.",
        "One additional bit of information for you - a recent 9th Circuit case - In Re: Mwangi - held that this practice violates the automatic stay provisions of the bankruptcy code. Even though I believe Wells will or has probably ceased this policy, I would still suggest that if there are funds in the business account prior to filing that you don't want to risk having held for days or weeks, sweep them out prior to filing, and put them back in after filing.

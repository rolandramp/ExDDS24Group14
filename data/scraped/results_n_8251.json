    "title": "I was sued in a Civil Court by a credit card company? But should I attend this conference at all to discuss about this debt?",
    "question": "I had filed Chapter 7 ( by self but screw up by the Trustee & Postal Service who changed my home address without letting me know & the appointment schedule from Court never arrived to my mail box) in result of debts to protect my under-value home (150K less and 75K over in the Mortgage Loan) and a 150K mileage car. I technically have nothing left. All 401K cashed out past couple years. One of the Bankruptcy attorney had once advised me to not to worry and no need to file any Chapter as I have nothing for the creditors to go after. I am not sure what to do next. Should I just show up and tell them point blank as I was protected under the Law for my house & furnitures & old car? OR just not show up at all? I dont have any much money to pay any attorney fee.",

    "question": "i opened a corporation in california in 09, never did any business (no assets, no debts) it is now in suspended status. if i have no plans on reviving the corp or doing any business under that corp name again, do i have to dissolve it and pay all the fees or does a suspended corp eventually go away and stop accruing fees? will my credit be affected since it was my SSN that is on the documents? any help is appreciated.",

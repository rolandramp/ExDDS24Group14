    "question": "I have a vehicle that was involved in my chapter 7 bankruptcy case (discharged in 2010). I neither redeemed the vehicle, reaffirmed the debt, nor surrendered the vehicle. I continued to make payments for some time but eventually fell behind. The finance company has since discharged the debt (approximately 1.5 years ago.) Since then, I have received information that the finance company is still attempting to repossess the vehicle. How long are they entitled to repossess the vehicle? I have asked that they bring their suit and I would stipulate to a money judgment.",

        "Most contracts for purchase of an automobile will have a clause stating that a BK is a \"default\" under the contract. Absent a default, lender cannot repossess. Once there is a default, like BK or lack of insurance or a missing payment, they can repossess. So, the money part of this is not what is at issue.",
        "You do not owe any money on the vehicle. Your discharge accomplished that. If you want to keep the vehicle chances are you could work out a deal with the finance company to pay for it. The company does not want to incur further costs to pick it up a vehicle that may have little auction value. They do not want a judgment. They want $s or the car.",
        "It was the BK, not the finance company, that discharged the debt. You have no personal liability to pay them; but they still have a lien on the vehicle and have the right to repossess it at any time.\nThey are not permitted to \"bring their suit\" for a money judgment ... that would violate the discharge injunction of your BK. I don't know what the vehicle is worth or how much you owed for it; but negotiation is always an option.",
        "They can repossess forever. It is their car. You did not pay it off. But why give them a money judgment? Tell them to come get the car. Let them know if they need a tow truck :) The debt was discharged. End of story."

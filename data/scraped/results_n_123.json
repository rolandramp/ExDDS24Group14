        "The best advice provided is to talk directly with a bankruptcy attorney in order to discuss your issues in detail.",
        "It depends.\nIf the divorce is fully resolved, there are no more joint accounts, no financial transactions recently, no property together, no money owed, etc., then there may be no issues for you other than she has to name you. But if all things are not resolved, then you need to look into this further.",
        "Hi,\n\nIt may not affect you at all. One of the bankruptcy petition forms, Schedule H: Your Codebtors, requires the filer to list any spouse that lived with them in the last 8 years in a community property state. If you are not a guarantor or cosigner of any of her debts then this would just be a procedural requirement and you shouldn't have anything to worry about.\n\nIf you think she owes you money and you've received notice of her bankruptcy then don't contact her about the amount you believe she owes as she is under the protection of Bankruptcy against any and all creditors. You'll want to follow the instructions in the notice you've received.\n\nBest,\nKale",
        "I agree with my colleagues. You don't give us any information on what your concerns are or what your situation is. Fortunately, most bankruptcy attorneys will give you a free or low cost initial consultation, call a local bankruptcy attorney or two.",
        "I will assume by \"ex\" you are fully divorced.\n\nFirst, always discuss with an attorney in person near you .\n\nSecond , I see only a couple things that can exist also such as either (a) she paid you back monies owed in last year called a preference , (b) you both co-own something that the ex does not have full exemptions in and thus the trustee might sell the ex's interest to you or sell all and give you half of it being your share, or (c) other issues if you owed property settlement or some other debt owed the ex but not exempt.\n\nGreat question and thanks for asking here on AVVO to. See and meet an experienced CA attorney to obtain full legal advice there now. Good luck.",
        "I have no idea. Do you owe any joint debts? Joint on a house or a car? Bank accounts? You have provided zero facts to consider."

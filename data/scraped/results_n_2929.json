    "title": "SELLING JUDGMENT FOR CASH",
    "question": "This question may be inappropriate for this site, and if so, I apologize. I have a small claims judgment for almost 7000, I am trying to sell it for cash (not enforce judgment using collection agency). Where or who can I contact in order to do so? Any suggestion will be highly appreciated. Thank you",

        "Value and saleability of judgment depends on number of factors you have not stated. Another option may be to hire debt collection counsel. Consult collection attorney.",
        "Selling it is probably not going to be possible. But, you can contact collection attorneys or collection companies and assign your judgment to them. They won't pay you anything up front for it, but will take the steps necessary to collect and split the recovery with you. You won't get the full judgment, but you might get something without having to do much. Make sure you find a reputable organization.",
        "The value of your judgment depends on whether the debtor has any recourse left, and whether the debtor has readily accessible assets to seize or lien. You will not get value until you know the answers to those questions. And once you know those answers, it's easier to collect the debt than to sell the judgment. I do not think you are going to find any takers - unless you want a very minimal amount.",
        "I doubt that your item is valuable. I know of no website that is interested in buying your item. You cannot sell it on eBay or Craiglist for example"

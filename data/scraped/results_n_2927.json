    "title": "Can auto loan bank charge off deficiency balance if I never reaffirmed loan after ch 7 bk discharge?",
    "question": "After my chapter 7 bankruptcy was discharged, I kept making payments on my car, but did not sign a reaffirmation agreement. After about two years, I surrendered the car to Nissan because I couldn't afford it anymore. They charged off a deficiency balance of $2,300 on my credit report. Is that legal?",

        "#bankruptcy. You are entitled to all the same legal rights with respect to this debt as you are for any other debts that you discharged.\n\nYou should follow the proceedures for disputing that on your credit report so that it will correctly state \"discharged in bankruptcy.\"",
        "Legally, the loan should be reported as \"included\" in your C7 BK and discharged. Charge off is a technical violation. You have been harmed because the charge off was reported two years after your discharge. Arguably, this delays your ability to obtain the fresh start you are entitled to from the BK. You may contact the creditor and credit reporting agency and demand correction.",
        "I agree with the answeres shown here by my colleauges. It is 6 of one and half a dozen of the other. Althought techically inaccurrate, what difference does it really make? Whether the debt is listed as \"Charged off\" or \"Discharged in bankruptcy\" you still don't owe the debt and it still is negative on your credit report.",
        "Strictly speaking, the loan should have been listed as \"included\" in bankruptcy once your bankruptcy was filed. So, in that respect, the charge off entry is, technically, inaccurate. You could dispute it with the credit reporting agencies, that will probably clean up the issue."

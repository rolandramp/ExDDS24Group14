        "If there are warrants out for your arrest, you can serve time if the police stop you and take you in to see the judge. You will not get any additional time, as long as the traffic tickets are infractions. If they are misdemeanors, that could be a different story. You should hire an attorney to go to court immediately to resolve the warrants/failure to appears. The judge might even let you convert the fines to community service, since you cannot pay."

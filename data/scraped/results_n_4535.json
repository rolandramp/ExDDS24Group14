    "title": "Court ordered debt collection - can the California Franchise Tax Board garnish my SSDI direct deposit which is my only income?",
    "question": "I just received a demand for payment to San. Francisco Superior Court and need to call to find out what it is for but I think it's for a municipal transportation violation back in 2006 before I was even a resident of California. My SSDI benefits are direct deposited into a checking account which also receives the occasional deposit from of gifts from friends or relatives but no employment as I do not work and have not even had to file income tax since 2009c.",
    "answers": [
        "The government does have the power to garnish for money it is owed. I suggest that you contact the Superior Court to find out what the fine is for and arrange for a payment plan so the matter can be resolved in a mutually agreeable way.",
        "Since this is a tax collection (which is what a fine/penalty really is - a tax) through the state, they have every legal right to garnish your SSI directly from the feds. Normal civil judgments can't do that, but governmental debt can. They can also grab any of the \"gift\" money you have in your bank account."

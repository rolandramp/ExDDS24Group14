        "There is no law or rule preventing a person with a multiple entry visa from entering multiple times. That is pretty much teh reason for the visa. When he comes he should just bring with him proof of his previous entry and timely exit from the US and proof of ties to the home country (like his mortgage, bank statements, etc) just in case they give him a hard time at the border.",
        "I have not heard of no such law. It does not really work this way. If the visit is a genuine with no intent to defraud the USCIS or with no intent of residing permanently, I doubt they will be denied entry.\n\nGood Luck\nShah Peerally\n\nFounder and Managing Attorney of Shah Peerally Law Group PC\nLaw Firm Deals in Immigration law & Debt Relief\n\nNote: The above answer is provided for informational use only.

    "title": "What is the California Statute of Limitations for medical/hospital debt?",
    "question": "I attempted to make an appointment at CHOC Orange County, Calif. for my special needs son Dec. 2013.The Doctor's office informed me his file was red flagged and wouldn't take the appointment until I paid an outstanding debt for my son from Jan. 2009. I was told the bill was sent to collections in June 2009 after the Doc's office had sent 2 bills to me (one in Feb. 2009 and April 2009). My son needed a medically necessary surgery, so I paid the bill. The bill is on my credit report, as of Jan. 2014 (the report shows: reported June 2009 and status shows: unpaid.) I plan to have CHOC send written notice to me and to Transunion, etc. to show it has been paid but I am wondering what recourse I have if their was a violation on their collecting, if there is a Statute of Limitations for Collection",

        "The statute of limitations on a written agreement in California is 4 years from the date of the breach of the written agreement. Most medical debts are incurred as a result of a written agreement. If, on the other hand, the medical bill is an \"open book account\", the rule is different. For open book accounts, the statute of imitations is 4 years from the date of the last entry in the account, i.e., from the date of the last payment, or from the date of the most recent charge on the account, if there was no payment made. California state law provides with the law on what constitutes an open book account.\n\nCalifornia Code of Civil Procedure Section 337(2) provides: An action to recover (1) upon a book account whether consisting of one or more entries; (2) upon an account stated based upon an\naccount in writing, but the acknowledgment of the account stated need not be in writing; (3) a balance due upon a mutual, open and current account, the items of which are in writing; provided, however, that where an account stated is based upon an account of one item, the\ntime shall begin to run from the date of said item, and where an account stated is based upon an account of more than one item, the time shall begin to run from the date of the last item."

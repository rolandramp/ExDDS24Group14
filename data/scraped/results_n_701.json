    "title": "For private student loans, do I have any recourse to lower payments besides bankruptcy? What if the lender violated FDCPA?",
    "question": "I have a private student loan and filed a loan modification request through the lender's program because the payments are difficult due to recent hospitalization and unemployment. After filing the application they told me that I would receive an answer in 5-7 business days. After 14 days, I did not receive a response to my application and I called 4 times and sent 4 letters requesting a response from them regarding what was needed to process my application. I was given the run around and 4 weeks later I received a denial letter and the reason for denial was listed as failure to provide required documents. The problem is that they never responded to my letters or phone calls to tell me what documents I needed to provide. I do not want to file bankruptcy. Because of this delay, I could not apply for a forbearance. Do I have any other recourse besides filling bankruptcy to get a lower payment? If you are knowledgeable about student loans and may be able to help, please mention it in the comments and I will call your office. I am willing to pay for your time for a consultation.",

        "First, the FDCPA only requires 3rd party collectors, normally law firms, collection agencies and debt buyers. If an employee of the original lender is collecting, that person is not required to comply with FDCPA provisions. However, some states have state laws that gives protection to consumers for certain acts of the original holder of the debt must follow. You need to meet with an attorney that is experienced in FDCPA claims as he/she would also be knowledgeable about any state laws that protect consumer borrowers.\n\nObtaining a discharge of student loans is very difficult. Because the federal student loans offer people the opportunity to participate in the income based repayment (IBR) plan and there is an opportunity to obtain an administrative discharge under some specific circumstances, discharging federal student loans in a bankruptcy is almost impossible. If a person’s income is low enough, the IBR payment can be reduced to $0.00 per month.\n\nDischarging at least a portion of the outstanding debt owed on private student loans can be done in some cases. First a law suit, called an adversary proceeding must be filed alleging that the student loan debt is dischargeable because payment of the loan will cause an undue hardship on the debtor and his/her dependents. Some courts use a test called the “totality of circumstances” in making the ruling on dischargeability. However, most of the bankruptcy courts around the country follow something called the “Brunner Test” to determine if a student loan can be discharged. The “Brunner Test” must be used in all of the Fifth Circuit states, which is where I practice. If your court follows the Brunner Test, then in layman’s terms you will be require to prove:\n\n1) That you cannot afford to pay the loan payments when your normal monthly income and living expenses are considered.\n\n2) That for the foreseeable future, your financial picture will continue to cause you to be unable to afford the payment for a significant portion of the student loan repayment period.\n\n3) That you have made a good faith effort to repay the loan or loans.\n\nFactors two and three are the issues we have proving so that my clients are entitled to discharge all or part of the student loans. First, the loan needs to be in payment status for a significant period of time and you need to be able to prove that you made payments when you could afford to pay them. I have seen cases in which the judge ruled that the debtor did not show a good faith effort to pay because the Debtor went by Starbucks every morning. The lenders and/or collection agencies will tell you that if you can’t pay the full payment, then do not send anything at all and the lenders’ attorneys will use the fact that you paid nothing against you.\n\nAnother possibility of discharging any student loan is showing that the degree from the school that you attended did not result in an educational benefit.\n\nYou need to contact an experienced bankruptcy lawyer in your area that handles a significant amount of litigation in his/her bankruptcy case and ask him to review your situation with what must be proved to discharge a student loan. Many attorneys will give you a free consultation to help you make the decision on what is best for you. You can use the Avvo \"Find a Lawyer\" link above to search for an attorney in your area.",

        "So let's start with the basics. First, filing a Chapter 7 case is the very first step. Your present and historic income has to be reviewed to ensure you qualify. Assuming that you do, you need to file the Chapter 7 case and obtain a discharge. At that juncture, you may then file an adversary proceeding and litigate your student loan issue. Depending on what your allegations are regarding the basis for your Adversary Proceeding against NCT, will determine your income issue.\n\nIf you allege that you are suffering from undue hardship and therefore the private student loan is a dischargeable debt, then your undue hardship has to last for quite some time. If, on the other hand, you allege that the student loan itself never qualified for the exception to discharge because of a Title IV issue, then your income is irrelevant.\n\nMay I strongly suggest that you seek the assistance of an experienced Bankruptcy/Student Loan Lawyer in California to assist you. This type of bankruptcy litigation can be tricky.\n\nHave a detailed plan on how to address NCT BEFORE you file your Chapter 7.",
        "Unless I misread your question, no one can answer \"How long will it take before I can start making money again\". What is preventing you from making money now?",
        "You are assuming that you are going to win? The tone of your question makes me think that you will be faking your hardship claim. It's pretty hard to win a hardship case even when you have a legitimate claim. It should be near impossible to win when you start out lying about it."

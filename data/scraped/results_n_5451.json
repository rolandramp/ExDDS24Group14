        "It is my understanding that you cannot bankrupt on Student Loans. There may be some loopholes, however since the law was revised so much in 2005, I would ask a full-time bankruptcy attorney.",
        "If either you or your daughter filed a Chapter 13 there is a co-debtor stay that would stop all legal action on the Wells Fargo student loan while the debtor is in the bankruptcy. The Chapter 13 plan can be written in such a way to pay the loan through the plan or not pay the loan. There is more flexibility in dealing with student loans in Chapter 13. This Wells Fargo student loan is currently non-dischargeable in any chapter of bankruptcy.",

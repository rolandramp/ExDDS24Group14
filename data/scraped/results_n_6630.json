    "title": "Does my credit affect my partner's if we register as domestic partners?",
    "question": "My partner is a homeowner, and has good credit, as well as significant savings. I have poor credit and am in debt roughly to the tune of 80% of those savings. If we become registered domestic partners, does my debt become shared? We are trying to pay my debt and build my credit, but it will not be the strong, perfect credit my partner has built. Will my lower credit score be a drag on my partner's score? If it matters, we plan not to comingle our money until my debts are resolved and my credit is better.",

        "No, the debts of a registered domestic partner that existed prior to registration as domestic partners do not become the debts of the other partner simply by virtue of your registration. Provided that your partner does not specifically agree to become a guarantor of your pre-existing debt, then he or she will not become liable for it. Nor will it affect his or her credit. Your instincts are sound regarding not commingling assets while you have debts. If you have debts that might result in a judgment against you, then you should avoid being added on title to your partner's property. Joint tenancy can lead to very negative consequences for a non-debtor co-owner in bankruptcy and in other contexts.",
        "Unless you have joint credit or joint assets, it shouldn't impact them."

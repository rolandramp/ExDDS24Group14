    "title": "Can I include civil judgments against me in bankruptcy?",
    "question": "My hubby sued \"Bob\" and lost. Hubby was ordered to pay $60k for Bob's legal costs. Bob is claiming Hubby acted maliciously causing Bob financial damage. There have not been any criminal charges at all. Bob is now suing us for another $300+k for damages. An upcoming settlement conference is expected to resolve the dispute and Bob will likely get $ just to end the suit. How can we include any orders to pay Bob in our Ch. 7 BK? What verbiage needs to be in the upcoming orders?",

        "You can file a bankruptcy and get out of this debt. A bankruptcy will stop all legal actions against you and your husband under the provisions of the Automatic Stay. You might expect that \"Bob\" might challenge your discharge and make your meeting of creditors difficult so please consult an experienced bankruptcy in your area. Some bankruptcy cases can be extremely difficult and yours may be one of those difficult cases.",
        "The Bankruptcy discharge will do away with their ability to collect the indebtedness and your obligation to pay it. However, the filed judgment will stay in the records of the Clerk's office for all to see unless you also bring a motion under section 522(f) of the code to vacate the record of the judgment and expunge it.",
        "A chapter 7 bankruptcy will in fact discharge civil judgments; also, the automatic stay of bankruptcy stops civil suits and the final discharge ends such civil law suits.\n\nThere is a question on the statement of financial affairs that asks you to list law suits, and then you also schedule the debt on schedule F along with your other unsecured debts.\n\nHowever, the exception is any count within a lawsuit that alleges fraud. You can file the bankruptcy, and then file a \"suggestion of bankruptcy\" in the court where the other case is pending. Then it will be up to \"Bob\" to file papers in the bankruptcy court. If \"Bob\" can prove that he has been or is being defrauded, the court can allow the claim to go forward.\n\nRetain experienced bankruptcy counsel to do this for you.\n\nThis answer is provided for informational purposes only.

        "No that is not legal. It is discrimination. If you have it in writing keep the evidence if they ever do fire you sue the pants off of them. If you dont have it in writing ask them to put it in writing and see what the reaction is.",
        "No, that would not be legal. BK Code Sect. 525(b) specifically states \"No private employer may terminate the employment of, or discriminate with respect to employment against, an individual who is or has been a debtor under this title, a debtor or bankrupt under the Bankruptcy Act, or an individual associated with such debtor or bankruptc, solely because such debtor or bankrupt - (1) is or has been a debtor under this title or a debtor or bankrupt under the Bankruptcy Act.\"\n\nHOWEVER, as stated in the referenced code section above, the anti-discrimination language of that section states that you cannot be terminated SOLELY because you have filed bankruptcy. BUT if there are other independent grounds for you to be terminated, then that would be a different matter. For example, since US Bank is a financial institution, you may have an employment agreement stating that the filing of a bankruptcy or other showing of an inability to manage your finances, or other such language for example, may be grounds for termination. If that is the case, then you might want to consult with an attorney that specializes in employment law to determine the enforceability of any such provision you may have agreed to as a condition of employment. If no such condition, then the above-referenced section should apply and it would be illegal for your employer to terminate you SOLELY for filing a BK.",
        "Categorically untrue - federal bankruptcy code specifically makes that illegal. I would be hard pressed to believe your employer would use THAT as the justification for terminating you.

        "If US Bank follows through on this claim, I am sure you would be able to find someone to represent you for a violation of 11 USC section 525(b). Sounds like this supervisor needs to take some refresher classes before costing the Bank some big bucks. Hope this perspective helps!",
        "It is illegal for an employer to fire you for filing for bankruptcy protection. 11 U.S.C. 525(b). This is true even if you have a debt with your employer that you are discharging. That being said, it is not terribly difficult for an employer to find alternative reasons for which to base your termination. If your back is against a wall, get your employer's threat to fire you in an email. That way, you have evidence should they decide to attempt to fire you and have leverage for them to reconsider their decision."

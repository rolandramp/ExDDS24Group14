    "title": "Is a notarized separation agreement binding?",
    "question": "My husband and I have separated. He and I both signed, and had notarized, a separation agreement distributing assets and financial accounts, we have no children and no joint debt. Does this constitute as a legal and binding contract? If he incurs debt between now and the time divorce papers are drawn, do I have any liability since we live in a community property state? Is he still entitled to any of my assets (specifically financially) even though he signed the separation agreement and willfully signed over previously agreed to accounts?",

        "It is best if it has been recognized and entered by the court. You can always submit it as evidence but it needs to be recognized by the court\n\n\nArnold & Wadsworth\nhttp://www.awdivorceutah.com",
        "All notarization does is guaranty the genuineness of signatures to prevent forgery claims. It's not some magic, all-purpose legal shortcut and/or seal of approval that turns an otherwise unenforceable contract into an enforceable one.\n\nYou're right that CA is a community property state, and the community begins at marriage and ends at separation. Generally, absent gifts to each other, whatever assets each of you had before marriage were your separate property and stay your respective separate property, and your sharing of your respective incomes and debts end when the community ends. So if this document clearly confirms a separation date, that date would be hard to deny later on.\n\nAs for the rest of your contract, as with any question that asks \"what does my contract say, what have I agreed to, and what are my rights?\" no lawyer can respond in any meaningful way without reviewing the document in question.

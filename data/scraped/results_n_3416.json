        "You can discharge your personal liability on the loans, but the SBA and the affiliated bank can still look to your collateral for payment. Typically, SBA loans will take a blanket security interest in your cars and sometimes other assets, as well as put a lien on your home. Depending on the equity or lack thereof in your home, you may be able to get rid of the lien on your home in a Chapter 13. I'd consult with an experienced bankruptcy attorney to discuss your options.\n\nAlso, the SBA has an offer in compromise program that may help you. In that regard, I would consult with a debt settlement attorney to see if the SBA OIC process is right for you.",
        "You need to speak to a good bankruptcy attorney in your area. There are many good ones here on Avvo. You can discharge your personal liability on the SBA loan and if there's little to no equity in your home, you might negotiate the lien away.\n\nRob",
        "Discharging the SBA loan isn't the problem. Typically the SBA takes all other property you own as collateral for its debt, so you pay the SBA to retain your property, not because the SBA loan wasn't discharged. Hope this perspective helps!",
        "You can wipe out your personal liability to pay, but the security would remain with the collateral unless you could strip it in a Chapter 13. Please be sure to get a market analysis and then meet with counsel as to what your best option is relative to the SBA loan and whether a 13 is even possible for you."

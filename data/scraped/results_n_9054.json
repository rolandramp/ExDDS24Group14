Then I realized that this case had been dismissed with out prejudice, but now I'm getting letters from a different collection company. What should I do? Help!",

        "You may have nothing to worry about if too much time has passed. Credit card company has 4 years from date due or date of last payment, whichever is later, to file suit. If they sent it to collections beyond the 4 years you can stop worrying and tell collectors claim is barred by Statute of Limitations and you will not pay ever.\n\nThe response given is not intended to create, nor does it create an ongoing duty to respond to questions.

        "Depending on how long it has been since your last payment, the debt may be beyond the statute of limitations, and thus time-barred. That does not mean that they cannot call you or report it on your credit, but time-barred means that they may not threaten to sue you or actually sue you. For more information about the debt, I would send letter 1.1 from my sample letters (link below) to the new debt collector, by certified mail, return receipt requested. Of course, always keep copies of your letter and their letters to you in a file or folder.\n\nIf you have any further questions, please contact me through my Avvo profile.

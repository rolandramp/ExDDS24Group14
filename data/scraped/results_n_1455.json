Under the purchase, JPMorgan Chase agreed to purchase and assume the secured debts of Washington Mutual.\n\nI guess you asking Chase Bank for proof that they owned the debt was liking asking for proof that the sun rises in the east every morning.",

You can however check the property records to see if an assignment was recorded on the deed of trust. WAMU went into a bankruptcy of sorts and all the loans were sold through the bk process some went through Wells Fargo then Chase, some went other places. so it was complicated; but a property report from a title company will tell you anything recorded against your property.",

    "question": "I have a medical debt which I am not able to pay. The creditors have said that if this is not paid within the next 10 days it will be sent to collection. I have some savings ($35,000) but it is not enough to pay the debt & I know that if I make a settlement for less than I owe that I will get a 1099 & still be unable to pay. My debt is around $93,000. I don't own any property but have about $10,000 in stock, a 401K plan, life insurance & about $4,300 in mutual funds. Can I loose all this money if I file BK. I do qualify for Chapter 7. Income is around $42,000 with a family of 3. Should I wait at least an year before filing or should I start the proceedings right away.",

        "In your case, you should speak with a Bankruptcy attorney in your area to begin Bankruptcy planning right away. If you filed without planning, you could lose a substantial portion of your cash assets, stocks and possibly the mutual funds. In California, the personal exemption is about $22,000 plus certain exemptions for personal property. Qualified retirement plans are exempt from the Trustee's reach. Life insurance is usually exempt unless there is a cash payout of more than about $13K.\n\nAgain, you are strongly urged to call a local Bankruptcy attorney to discuss your case.\n\nScott Jordan",

        "I say this to literally everyone that calls my office... the key to an appropriate bankruptcy filing is proper bankruptcy planning. The important thing is not to file prematurely.

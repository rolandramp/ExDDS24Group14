    "title": "How do I get a \"Robo-Signed\" Affidavit from a credit card debt collector thrown out as hearsay??",
    "question": "I'm in the discovery phase and received what appears to be a \"robo-signed\" affidavit from Citibank confirming my unproven debt even though the debt was sold and resold to two different debt collectors. The Affidavit is signed by someone at Citibank named Lana Handy. I Googled \"Lana Handy Affidavit\" and found out debt collectors are sending thousands of these generic affidavits to defendants to allegedly confirm whatever amount they want. How can I get this Affidavit thrown out as hearsay?? There is no way one person (Lana Handy) has knowledge of thousands of accounts and balances and has the time to notarize affidavits and send them to first and second hand debt collectors within a few days. There's something fishy going on, and I need to know specifically how to get this affidavit axed",

        "There are attorneys that handle this cases where credit card companies sell unpaid accounts to companies known as \"junk debt\" buyers or \"debt scavengers\" for pennies on the dollar and then file suit without the necessary documents and verifications or affidavits from individuals who have no knowledge of the facts in the complaint at issue.\nChallenging this on y0ur own can be very difficult if not impossible. YOu need to retain someone to assist you. i suggest you go to the website of the National Association of Consumer Advocates. There you can search for a local lawyer who handles these cases.",
        "While I agree that you can call Ms. Handy as a witness, you may be required to pay for her travel here to appear at trial. You might send her special interrogatories and put her on your witness list as a tactic to settlement. A lot depends on how much is at stake. The signer of an affidavit must have \"personal knowledge\" of the contents in her affidavit, but in this type of case, Ms. Handy would be able to review her books and records which are kept in the ordinary course of business and the entries therein were made at or near the time of the event and are otherwise \"trustworthy\". This is the so-called business record exception to the hearsay rule. In Federal cases the rule is found at FRE ยง803(b). In California it is found Evidence Code ยง1270 et seq. Good luck.",

        "If the credit card company actually made a fraudulent representation to you with the knowledge or at least reasonable belief you would rely on this representation to your determent, and you in fact did rely on the statement and suffered some damage, then you may have a case. However, the Court will also want to know if you received a benefit from the use of the card. Additionally, I have never heard of a credit card company committing fraud to the level a Judge reversed the obligation to pay back the card. If however, this is more of a case where you are being chased by a debt collection company, and the account was not properly assigned, there may be standing issues, where the debt collector is not the proper party trying to recover the debt and their case could be dismissed. In either case, check with a good consumer debt attorney.",

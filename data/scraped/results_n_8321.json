    "title": "Chapter 7 Bankruptcy? Can I carry tax forward?",
    "question": "Hello I want to file chapter 7 bankruptcy in California. In the last several years I lost a lot of money on my investments. I now have large tax loses (over 200k). I am not able to carry them back to get a refund, but I am able to carry them forward. If I file chapter 7, will I lose my right to carry-forward the tax losses against income I earn in the future?",
    "answers": [
        "Since the carry forward losses reduce your tax liability for future years and may even result in a tax refund, the carry forward losses count as future assets that a bankruptcy trustee can seize. Whether he can sell them or must hold your case open until you claim them all is determined whether the IRC lets you sell or otherwise transfer them. A good CPA can value them and determine what it might cost you to buy back the losses at a discount. You still might come out ahead.\n\n[I am a Virginia-licensed attorney.

        "You may be able to use the losses if you have gains this year and file a short period tax return. You are running out of time for this maneuver. Other wise the losses are part of the estate.\n\nDisclaimer\nAlthough the above response is believed to be accurate, it should not be relied upon as any type of legal advice because the information provided is incomplete.

        "Yes, you may lose the carry forwards in an amount equal to the amount of debt you are discharging. You really need to consult with a qualified CPA on this. Section 108 of the Internal Revenue Code states that forgiveness of debt is not included in your gross income, but any tax attributes--such as loss carry forwards--will be reduced in order of priority by the amount of debt forgiven (the priority is set forth in that code section).\n\nMark J.

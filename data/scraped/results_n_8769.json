    "title": "Is there any way to find out if you have been sued or have judjements against you?",
    "question": "My husband and I are going to file bankruptcy, we have about $140,000 in unpaid debt from 2006-2007. We owned our own company and it went under at the end of 2007 beginning of 2008. Most of the debt though is personal. We had been moving for jobs and did not receive some of our mail, so we do not know if we have ever been sued or have any judjements against us. Thanks for the help.",

        "Your bankruptcy lawyer should pull your credit report. However, the information you are seeking may not yet be on your credit report, so you should then do a name search on the superior court website for the county you live in and the counties surrounding it to determine if there are any lawsuits filed against you.\n\nHope that helps.\n\nGerald Wolfe",

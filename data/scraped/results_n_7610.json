    "question": "I have been contacted by Nelson & Kennard regarding a $13k debt I have with Capital One. This has been dismissed without prejudice in the state of Ohio when I was temp. living in that state. I am now a resident of CA and this firm is trying to collect. I just mailed a debt validation letter back to them. How should I handle? Should I try and settle or let them sue?",

    "answers": [
        "Please be aware that Capital One cards are subject to Virginia's 3 year statute of limitations and not the longer 4 year statute of limitations under California law. If it has been more than 3 years since your last payment on the account, this would be a winning defense to any lawsuit filed by Nelson & Kennard. Finally, I would never recommend that someone simply pay a debt collector. Any attorney who does is either a debt collector or has no knowledge or experience in this area of the law.",
        "I don't have enough info about your case to advise you whether to settle. You have several options: (1) attempt to settle before filing of lawsuit (you might receive a IRS Form 1099-C for any deficiency); (2) wait for suit and hope Capital One can't serve you and it dismisses the case; (3) wait for suit and service and serve a demand for bill of particulars, file an answer or general denial, and serve discovery requests with the hope Capital One dismisses the case. (Some plaintiffs are only interested in obtaining easy default judgments.) You can attempt to settle any time during the process; make sure you get an agreement in writing signed by someone from Capital One (not just its attorney) and the agreement releases all claims against you. If bankruptcy is an option for you, you can file anytime during the process; Capital One will have to stop its collections efforts immediately upon filing of the bankruptcy petition.",
        "you can answer the complaint and request the bills with discovery. If you force these guys and get close to trial you can typically get a 50% settlement. Talk to a local lawyer.",
        "Normally, I agree with Mr. Chen, but not this time.\n\nWhether you have a defense against Capital One is not the issue. You can push Nelson & Kennard to prove that they have a right to collect. Also, if you dispute the debt and they cannot validate it, they cannot sue you. If they do, you may claims against them.\n\nSee a local consumer law attorney if they sue you on this debt. You do not need a defense if they can't prove their case.",
        "If they sue, and you want to settle, you will need to have some leverage. Leverage in settling a debt is filing the correct responding paperwork so it will be tied up in court & a lump sum of cash in your pocket to offer them. Without a lump sum of cash, you won't be able to obtain a very good settlement offer.\n\nHope this perspective helps!",
        "If you owe the debt and have no viable defenses, you ought to settle before they sue."

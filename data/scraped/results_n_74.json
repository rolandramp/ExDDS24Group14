    "title": "My car is totaled and the loan was discharged in chapter 7 . Ford finance refuses to inform ca. dmv that loan is discharged,",
    "question": "Car still has lien with ca. dmv Ford has received discharged info but tells me no obligation to inform dmv . Since car still shows lien I cant give to Junk Yard or donate. How to inform dmv of discharge?",
    "answers": [
        "If this vehicle is still in your possession, and Ford will not come and pick it up, you can have it towed to the nearest Ford dealership and then go to the DMV and file a release of liability. Ford will then dispose of the vehicle. BTW, did you have full coverage for the financed vehicle as required? If so, turn the issue over to your insurance carrier.",
        "... not sure why a Lemon Law attorney would be weighing in on a BK question, but there is no BK rule requiring a lender to inform ANYONE of your Discharge - that's YOUR responsibility (as suggested by Mr Steingraber)\nFord's lien remains on what's left of the car (liens survive bankruptcy).",
        "I make this suggestion in desperation: Have you been to DMW with a copy of your Discharge Notice and Schedule D?",
        "Sorry for your issues. I think your bk attorney may be able to make some hay for you if they are refusing to abide by the BK rules."

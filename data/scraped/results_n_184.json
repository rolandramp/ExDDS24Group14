    "title": "Can you discharge a civil judgment if the claim was for nonpayment on a student loan?",
    "question": "I received a judgment and began garnishing wages for breach of contract, non payment for a student loan I co-signed on. The original student filed for bankruptcy and his attorney recently contacted me to say that I cannot garnish his wages anymore since my claim was discharged in the bankruptcy. How can I see if my claim was indeed discharged? Also, the student loan is still in collections, can I see if I am the only debtor on the student loan since he apparently got it discharged?",

        "I understand that there is some confusion, so let me try to explain. When the student loan was taken out, you and the student agreed that you would both be responsible for the full amount of the debt. The student loan lender can choose who to pursue, and they are collecting on the judgment from you. That being said, you cannot go after the student borrower because your claim against him is not a student loan and was discharged, absent you initiating a proceeding during the student's bankruptcy. Further, absent the student initiating an action during the bankruptcy, that debt is not discharged.\n\nYou may want to consider speaking with an attorney who is experienced in both student loans and bankruptcy.",
        "The lawyer should be sending you a copy of the discharge and you would get a case number, and name of the court, etc.\n\nI'm having difficulty with the question because the background facts are not completely stated.\n\nIt sounds like you sued the student and obtained a judgment against him because he owed you money to reimburse you for paying for his student loan.\n\nOn the other hand you write that the student loan is still in collection. Then why would the student owe you money, if you both still owe it to the lender?\n\nIf he filed a chapter 7 case, his liability to you could be discharged. It wouldn't mean that the loan to the lender is discharged as to anyone else.\n\nWhether the student loan from the lender's perspective is within the exception to discharge pursuant to Sec. 523(a)(8) is a whole different question, but I don't think the exception could apply to your claim against the student because you didn't make a loan; you only would be seeking reimbursement from the student if the lender came after you.",
        "Having received notice of the bankruptcy, you are prevented from further collection efforts - as stated by my colleagues. Whether you had some type of claim in the bankruptcy case to see nondischargeability of the debt, requires an analysis by a bankruptcy attorney and depending upon when the case was filed, it may be too late to take that action. Talking with a bankruptcy attorney for a full review is recommended."

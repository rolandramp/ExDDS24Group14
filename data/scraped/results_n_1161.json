        "Law enforcement can subpoena text messages for a few days after they are exchanged. After that, you can only get them off the devices that exchanged them. Once deleted, after a few days, they disappear.\n\nAnd WHAT would you prove with these text messages? Cheating is legally irrelevant except to the extent that you can prove transactions or occurrences that affect the welfare of minor children or an accounting for income, assets, and debts. Fault for the breakdown of a marriage just isn't relevant.",
        "Very unlikely. Text messages are not typically recorded because of the large amount of costs in saving them. Accordingly, all you will be able to get is the number that was being text to and from. But then again, the question is what relevance will they play. Doesn't appear that you will be able to use that information even if you had it. Good luck.",
        "Cheating is irrelevant in California. Irreconcilable differences are the grounds for dissolution. As irrelevant texts of \"cheating\" would not be discoverable under most circumstances."

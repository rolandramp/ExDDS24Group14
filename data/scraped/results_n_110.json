        "What are \"autistic deductions,\" exactly? In any event, the answer to your question is yes. You must disclose this overdrawn bank account as a debt in your bankruptcy. 99 out of 100 times, that debt will be discharged. An overdrawn bank account is simply a line of credit extended by the bank. That debt has no special status in bankruptcy and is dischargeable.",
        "Good answers already provided by my colleagues. Be very mindful about the negative impact discharging the debt on your ability to get a bank account. You should be talking directly with a bankruptcy attorney for overall advice regarding filing bankruptcy.",
        "My colleagues have given you accurate advice. I add the following: Remember, BK is more than checking boxes on forms you find online. Find/consult/hire a lawyer in your area using the Avvo feature \"Find a Lawyer\". Make a list of 4-5 having many 5 star reviews from satisfied clients. If you don't get a prompt call back from one, go on to the next on your list. Some offer a free consultation by phone or in person. Take us up on it.\n\nBecause the bankruptcy process can be handled entirely by phone, email and fax, there is no need to personally visit the lawyer’s office unless you want to. Don’t be limited by the location of the BK lawyers you select.",
        "You can list it in your bankruptcy petition and have the debt discharged, but your bigger problem may be that the bank will put you in the CHEX system to which, to my knowledge, every bank subscribes. It means that you will never be able to open up another bank account without clearing up the negative balance. See your bankruptcy attorney for details. If you don't have one, get one. This is not a DIY project.",
        "The first BIG mistake persons make filing bankruptcy is NOT to sit down with an attorney and discussing all aspects and because of that I infer you have NOT done that. Why? Because every attorney will tell you ALL debts no matter what must be listed in any Bankruptcy. Period. No exceptions.\n\nSecond, the good news: it is dischargeable.\n\nThird, other issues and facts can affect your case and the only thing you need to do now..I already told you..see an attorney in person. Here are reasons why too.\nYou need and want to enjoy your fresh start also. But the most important thing is to meet with an attorney as you asking this question means you have not. You care about 2 goals: keeping everything you have equity in and discharging all your debts. If you don't have any of the exceptions to discharge you will obtain that goal; most exceptions are set forth in 11 USC. 523 (Google it) like child support, some income taxes, traffic (in a ch 7) and criminal fines , and presumption of student loans. But some debts are dischargeable in a ch 13 but NOT in a ch 7 so you want to make sure and your attorney will discuss any such types with you also!\n\nYour exemptions depend on what state you have lived in in the last 2 years and thus if in your state, then your states exemptions will apply. Most persons filing keep everything they own but your attorney will confirm that with you when they learn everything you own and the equity thereof!\n\nSome secured debts like homes, vehicles, other secured debts an attorney will discuss your options on also as you must list any debts; but that does not mean you will lose them unless you have too much equity or are in default on paying for them! Discuss those options if they apply with your attorney too.\n\nBut other issues can arise that can greatly harm your case. Just one example: If you paid back a relative $3,000 11 months ago and now file bankruptcy next week, the trustee can SUE that relative to retrieve that $3,000 (under what is called a preference) for the benefit of the bankruptcy estate. As a result, most attorneys don't charge to meet with them the first meeting so meet with one no matter what.\n\nMany great attorneys can be found right here on AVVO in your state so look, call, and meet one as soon as you can.\n\nYou should also want to know when to file: is there an advantage of waiting versus filing now and who should you pay between now and then! Good luck and enjoy your later fresh start."

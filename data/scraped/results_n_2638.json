        "As the other attorneys have stated, your mobile home is real property and a lien can be recorded against the mobile home. California is a community property state and therefore the mobile phone could very well be community property. As to whether your wife has any liability with your debts, that is an analysis a bankruptcy attorney can do for you. I agree with my colleagues, if you have concerns about your assets at this level, you should see a bankruptcy attorney.",
        "Your mobile home is considered real property for purposes of bankruptcy and is exempt in the amount of approximately $25,000 or up to $175,000 depending on which exemption statute we use. A lien can be put on the property but the creditor will need to get a judgment against you first. Even thought you think it is a separate debt, California is a community property state and as such, your wife may also be liable. Please talk to a bankruptcy attorney for further clarification and to review your options.",
        "Yes a lien can be put on your mobile home. Your wife could be liable. It seems like BK may be a good option for you to rid this debt prior to it becoming a secured debt on your mobile home. Call and speak with an experienced BK attorney ."

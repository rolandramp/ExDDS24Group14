    "title": "How is a Judgment Debtorâ€™s examination recorded?",
    "question": "How will my answer be preserved? Will there be a Court Reporter? Can either side record it? Do I get a copy of the Q and A? Can I demand a copy at the beginning to ensure I get one at the end and if not can I refuse to participate? My opponent cannot be trusted to have control of the record.",
    "answers": [
        "Either side can hire a certified court reporter, although I have never seen this done in a normal judgment debtor examination relating to a consumer debt. Why do you want to have a record? If you are the debtor, just tell the truth. The truth is the truth, regardless of whether there is a court reporter.\n\nAt the examination the debtor will be sworn by the court clerk, who will note the appearances in the court's notes. The creditor will then take the debtor to another room, or into the hallway, and ask questions. At the conclusion of the questioning, everyone returns to the courtroom, and the clerk will release the debtor.",
        "Normally there is no record. However, if the judgment creditor wants to pay for a reporter, a reporter can be present. If you want a copy of any transcript, you can order one. It will cost you -- you are not entitled to one free of charge. Your answers are intended to allow the creditor to discover your assets and, perhaps, to obtain a turn-over or other court order with respect to them. You cannot refuse to attend or answer questions without consequences. You are entitled to be represented by counsel at the examination. Good luck.",
        "Normally, there is no court reporter (although the judgement creditor is entitled to pay for one and to have a court reporter there). You will not obtain a copy of the questions and answers. You cannot demand a copy at the beginning, and you cannot refuse to participate.\n\nYou are entitled to be represented by an attorney at the judgment debtor's examination.\n\nThe reason why the judgment debtor examination is conducted at the courthouse is that the judgment creditor can go back to the judge if there is a problem and/or the judgment creditor needs an order from the court."

    "title": "Filing chapter 7. Separated from husband. He makes all the $. How should I show on budget section?",
    "question": "So filing chapter 7 for a very simple situation. But I am separated from my husband. We just separated recently and his money is still pretty much paying all of the bills and I get a little from him for expenses. I'm living at my sisters. How do I show my income or lack thereof in the budget section of the bankruptcy petition? We also share custody of the kids. We own a home together but he is staying there. No equity in the home though.",
    "answers": [
        "Your question involves crossover BK and FL issues.\nBecause you are separated, only include income you receive, from all sources, on your income schedule.",
        "Divorce and Bankruptcy often go hand in hand... If you are separated, your husband's income will not count against your. However, you need to meet with an attorney who specialized in both bankruptcy and family law who can tell you all the ins and outs of the situation you are walking in to. California is a community property state, it can make things extremely confusing.",
        "I agree with my colleagues. If you are separated and living apart you do not put his income on your petition. However you must put on the petition he or anyone else gives you for example his payments for groceries, child support etc as well as your sister pays for your expenses such as rent.\n\nAlthough your situation may be common it is not necessarily simple. You should consult a bankruptcy attorney to deal with both of your assets debts and income and expenses.",
        "Contrary to your belief, your situation is anything but simple. If you really need to file for bankruptcy protection your husband's income is not included in the means test or your budget, but you do need to list any and all income including any support you receive from your husband. In addition, although separated, unless you had a prenuptial agreement or your husband's assets are truly separate property, you still need to list all of your husband's assets in your bankruptcy case because California is a community property state. In addition, you need to make sure that there is no equity in the home or any other asset that you own. If you have too much equity you the Chapter 7 Trustee will take the asset and sell it to pay your creditors. As others have stated bankruptcy is not a \"do it yourself project\". I strongly encourage you to engage an experienced bankruptcy attorney to assist you.",
        "I hope you enjoy quality time with your sister and the kids their aunt. As you already know, you list what income you receive only, not what he receives. But because you are asking the question, it means you have not discussed with an attorney and hence my statement: you really need to do that. Too many issues can affect your case and I point out only some below.\n\nYou need and want to enjoy your fresh start also. But the most important thing is to meet with an attorney as you asking this question means you have not. You care about 2 goals: keeping everything you have equity in and discharging all your debts. If you don't have any of the exceptions to discharge you will obtain that goal; most exceptions are set forth in 11 USC. 523 (Google it) like child support, some income taxes, traffic (in a ch 7) and criminal fines , and presumption of student loans. But some debts are dischargeable in a ch 13 but NOT in a ch 7 so you want to make sure and your attorney will discuss any such types with you also!\n\nYour exemptions depend on what state you have lived in in the last 2 years and thus if in your state, then your states exemptions will apply. Most persons filing keep everything they own but your attorney will confirm that with you when they learn everything you own and the equity thereof!\n\nSome secured debts like homes, vehicles, other secured debts an attorney will discuss your options on also as you must list any debts; but that does not mean you will lose them unless you have too much equity or are in default on paying for them! Discuss those options if they apply with your attorney too.\n\nBut other issues can arise that can greatly harm your case. Just one example: If you paid back a relative $3,000 11 months ago and now file bankruptcy next week, the trustee can SUE that relative to retrieve that $3,000 (under what is called a preference) for the benefit of the bankruptcy estate. As a result, most attorneys don't charge to meet with them the first meeting so meet with one no matter what.\n\nMany great attorneys can be found right here on AVVO in your state so look, call, and meet one as soon as you can.\n\nYou should also want to know when to file: is there an advantage of waiting versus filing now and who should you pay between now and then! Good luck and enjoy your later fresh start.",
        "While I agree with my colleagues, I have to ask: \"Why are you filing BK?\" Until that reason is known, I would reserve making any response. You need to meet with a BK lawyer. Some of us offer a free consultation or case analysis by phone or in person. Take us up on it.",
        "If separated, then income of non-filing spouse will not count against you. You may still want to include in your budget a line item for his contribution income received by you to help support your monthly living expenses. There are a few different places in your chapter 7 bankruptcy filings where the details of your separation and your income/income sources become important and should be taken care of correctly when preparing your case.\n\nWhen considering bankruptcy, even your suggestion of a \"very simple\" situation gets tricky almost immediately, especially when talking about marital separations and division of assets, division of income, ownership status, domestic support needs/obligations, and so on. Sometimes it makes more sense to get quality professional help when facing the unknown.",
        "First of all- I am sorry you are going through this. Life is humbling isn't it? Second, being physically separated, you would list your income (whatever you get each month from him or family) and list your expenses by yourself. You would list your assets and your percentage of ownership to them. I would highly recommend you hire a bankruptcy lawyer as soon as possible. This is not to be construed as legal advice. Good luck!",
        "You believing that bankruptcy will involve a 'simple situation' would be funny if the repercussions to you won't be so tragic. I expect you are someone that will need to learn the hard way. To answer your question, your income is whatever you have coming in to live off. If that is money from your spouse, your mom, or other family, list that. If you get benefits, like food stamps, social security, or unemployment, list that too. Be absolutely sure you list every crumb you receive. Tell the truth, the whole truth, etc. Hope this perspective helps."

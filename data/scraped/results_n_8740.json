    "answers": [
        "Yes, the FL-141, or Declaration Regarding Service of Declaration of Disclosure, is a mandatory form. In it, you swear to the court that you have served your Preliminary and/or your Final Declaration of Disclosure. This is a packet of forms consisting of the Declaration of Disclosure Cover sheet, the FL-140, a Schedule of Assets and Debts (or FL-142), and an Income and Expense Declaration (or FL-150). All of these forms must be served with every Preliminary Declaration of Disclosure, and this package as a whole must be served in every, divorce, legal separation or nullity.\n\nIn addition, if you are preparing for a trial on the matter, you must serve a Final Declaration of Disclosure at least 45 days before the trial. The Final Declaration of Disclosure contains the same three forms mentioned above, along with some other information. The Final Declaration of Disclosure serves to update and complete the information in the Preliminary Declaration of Disclosure. However, this is generally only done if parties are preparing for trial.\n\nIf you have reached a settlement, you will waive the Final Declaration of Disclosure by having both parties sign a FL-144, or Stipulation and Waiver of Final Declaration of Disclosure. If the other side is not appearing, then you would check the appropriate box on your FL-141 and in your other default judgment paperwork.\n\nHope that answers your questions.",
        "The FL-141 form is a declaration that serves as a proof of service, in which you declare to the Court that you have served your preliminary and/or final declaration of disclosure on the other party in the case. You must file a proof of service as to your preliminary and final declaration. There is an exception, which is that the parties can waive the final declaration of disclosure in a separately executed document that must also be filed.\n\nThe FL-150 Income & Expense Declaration is part of your mandatory family law disclosure in the state. You must complete an I&E even if your case settles."

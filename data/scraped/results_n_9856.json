    "question": "I got sued for one credit card for 2500. I stopped making payments because they wouldn't work with me on a payment plan. I got a letter placing a lien on any of my property, but I have nothing. So what does this mean down the road?",

        "Note that I am not licensed to practice in your state.\n\nIf the first credit card company has a judgment against you already and threatened to place a lien on you then that's what they have. They probbaly can't get a lien on you because you don't owe a home and they don't have bank account information. If you ever do pay them, remember to do a bank check or money order and never pay from a personal checkings account because then they will have your information and can garnish your accounts.\n\nIt sounds like a small amount of credit card debt compared to many people in America but I know how you must feel. The student loan debt is going to be with you forever and it's not something you can discharge even in bankruptcy.\n\nWhat you need to do is look at this not as a burden, but an opportunity. You've gotten a better degree using the student loan. Use that degree. And if that degree is not getting you enough work, then get a second job and a third job if you must. Have family try to babysit for you if they can. YOu have to do everything in your power to build a good home for your child. Living in debt weighs not only on you but your child. They can feel that something is wrong and it weighs on them too.\n\nBottom line, don't see your student loan debt as a bad thing. It furthered your education and gave you something for the rest of your life. You will eventually pay it off. Little by little, it will happen. As you make more and more money, you will also pay off the credit card debts. You have a degree. You're a single mother. You are strong and you need to believe that. When you believe you're weak or stuck, then that keep you from being more and making more."

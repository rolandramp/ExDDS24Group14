    "title": "Is there a Statute of Limitations for credit card dispute ( civil case ) ?",
    "question": "I am the defendant in a civic case. Credit card debt. Is there a statute of limitations of that debt and does that change if I have made any payments on the account. I.E. does the statute of limitations start from the date of the last credit card charge or my last payment ? Or doesn't a statute of limitations apply here ?",
    "answers": [
        "Yes, there is a statute of limitations. However, what it is depends on facts you have not posted. Depending on the exact facts it may be anywhere from 2-4 years, if you were a CA resident when the account was opened.\n\nWhen the statue starts to run depends on the cause of action alleged and the conduct of the parties following breach. There are tolling provisions that may also be applicable.\n\nYou should consult a consumer attorney to discover your available defenses and for assistance in gathering the required proof of any available defense so you can properly defend against the suit.",
        "The answer is that it depends on what causes of action are alleged in the complaint, if a complaint is filed. It also depends on whether the creditor presents evidence that the agreement satisfies the requirement for a written contract, versus an oral or implied contract. If a written contract, does the agreement adopt the laws of a state with a shorter statute of limitations, such as Virginia, New Hampshire, or Delaware?\n\nI have a blog that explains my \"Don't Pay a Dime Strategy,\" linked below. The SOL requires careful legal analysis, for which your posting did not provide sufficient facts and there is no lawsuit filed yet, so it is difficult to speculate what the creditor or debt collector will allege.\n\nRobert Stempler (please see DISCLAIMER below)\nwww.StopCollectionLawsuits.com\nwww.facebook.com/SoCalConsumerLawyer\nTwitter: @RStempler",

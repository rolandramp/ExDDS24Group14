    "title": "Is back rent are considered \"consumer debts\" within the meaning Federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act?",
    "question": "I was served with 3-day notice to pay or quit by I assume a new deed holder. The notice is written in a form of debt collecting. It states that I owe the \"original creditor\"( my landlord) for two months June and July 2014. I have to pay the \"new creditors\" that \"debt\" or move out within 3 days. It also quotes Fair Debt collection laws like \"This is an attempt to collect the debt and any information obtained will be .....\"",

        "To answer your primary question, the definition of \"Consumer Debt\" Under the FDCPA is: \"The term “debt” means any obligation or alleged obligation of a consumer to pay money arising out of a transaction in which the money, property, insurance, or services which are the subject of the transaction are primarily for personal, family, or household purposes, whether or not such obligation has been reduced to judgment.\"\n\nAs such, since the obligation was primarily for personal, family, or household purposes, back rent is considered a debt under the FDCPA.\n\nThe other attorney answers adequately addressed the other aspects of your question.",
        "In an action for unlawful detainer (\"eviction\"), the landlord must file the lawsuit within 1 year of the date of default. Otherwise, the landlord can sue for the rent but not for possession of the premises. Before giving an opinion as to whether the collector's notice violated 1682e, I would need to review the document.",
        "Do you owe back rent? If so you need to act fast.",
        "Yes. Back rent is a \"consumer debt\" within FDCPA. Several recent cases support this position.\nHowever, special expedited procedures apply to landlord tenant law, evictions and collections.\nThere is no statutory right to notice when building ownership transferred. New owner is subject to rental agreement you had with previous owner..\nI have attached a link you may find helpful below.\nhttp://www.tenant.net/Court/romea/nylj981007.html",
        "Debt collectors are liable if they violate the FDCPA, so they almost always put it in their letters to a consumer, even if the debt is not subject to the FDCPA. However, there are cases that consider unpaid rent on a consumer tenancy a debt, subject to the FDCPA. The notice you received is a three-day notice, under California law. Consult promptly an attorney in your area who handles cases for tenants to understand your options and rights and fight eviction, if improper. However, if an eviction is filed and you don't have a defense, then the court will evict you and this will also likely show up on credit reports that future landlords will also see, so you may want to consider resolving this before an unlawful detainer action is filed."

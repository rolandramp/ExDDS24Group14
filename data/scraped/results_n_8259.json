I need advice on what is best for me at this time. Should I:",

        "Believe it or not, your situation is fairly normal. A lot of my advice depends on whether you have any liability for deficiencies on your Texas rental properties. I do not know Texas law but I think a deficiency is a good possiblity. If you do, bankruptcy may be your best option to get rid of the Texas rental property debt and your credit card debt. Also, as long as you own your home, you are much more likely to qualify for a Chapter 7 bankruptcy. You should meet with a good bankruptcy attorney for a strategy session to see what your best option is. When someone does file bankruptcy, I usually recommend filing bankruptcy first, trying for a loan modification after you file for bankruptcy (yes, it can proceed even during bankrutpcy) and then if the loan modification does not work and you cannot afford your mortgage, trying a short sale. A short sale will make it easier than a foreclosure to buy a house in the future. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have underwriting guidelines on their websites. These guidelines change often but they have consistently allowed someone to get a new home loan sooner after a short sale than after a foreclosure. The most important thing is for you to make a decision while you still own your home and you should allow enough time to prepare a bankruptcy petition. With a sale date of 2/20/11, you are smart to be thinking of these questions but I would encourage you to meet with an attorney as soon as possible to give yourself the time to pursue your best strategy.\n\nPlease note that although this answer may provide information concerning potential legal issues, it is not a substitute for legal advice from qualified counsel. You should consult an attorney for individual advice regarding your own situation.

        "I agree with Attorney Bunce. Your situation is far too complicated for anyone on Avvo to advise you what you should do. Moreover, as she indicates, you might not even qualify to file for bankruptcy.\n\nSince the foreclosure sale is coming up in February, you need to immediately hire (and pay for) a bankruptcy attorney to analyze your situation and to explain the options to you.",
        "Your circumstances are far too complicated for a simple answer. You will need to sit down with a very experienced bankruptcy attorney to review your entire situation. Expect to pay a fee for this advice, as the amount of time to complete the analysis of this situation will be substantial.\n\nYou may not qualify for bankruptcy and you may have other issues that affect the decision on how to proceed.\n\nHope this perspective helps!"

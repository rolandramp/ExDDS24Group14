    "title": "What form do you use to respond to a SUM-100?",
    "question": "My sister is physically and mentally disabled and somehow ended up with many credit cards (and used them!) I went to a legal aid office, and they said I could write letters to the credit companies indicating her situation, and that she was \"judgement free\"...This worked for all but one...today she was served with a summons from Discover and is being sued for that outstanding balance. I'm wondering what form I use to respond. I know once the court sees her condition, and hears the details of the charges.... it will most likely be dropped. She loaned the card to another patient at the adult day health center who said she'd pay her back. Obviously my sister is no longer in charge of her finances.",

    "title": "Bankruptcy attorney isn't doing his job. We've already paid him. What do we do?",
    "question": "My parent's hired him for their bankruptcy a year ago before my dad died. They paid an extra $1,000 to have all the leins and judgements against their house lifted. There were a lot of issues w/ him the first time around (once he didn't show up for a court date and didn't call or respond to us for over a week) but my mom got a letter confirming everything was finished finally. I'm buying my parent's house to help my mom and the title company just told us all leins are still on the house ($30,000 worth). The attorney said he'd reopen the case and \"take care of it\" but now he's stopped responding again. His assistant confirmed we'd paid to have them taken care of last year so he apparently just didn't do his job. It's been 3 weeks and the loan company is ready to drop us. What can I do?",

        "In my 38 years as a BK atty, I always regret hearing about the misdeeds, mistakes, and failures of one of my colleagues. The good news is, you have remedies available to you: (1) If your parents case is closed, it can be reopened, and the judgment liens can be removed by the filing of motions to avoid the liens; (2) If the original attorney is unwilling to refund the extra money he rec'd to remove the liens, you can file a complaint against him/her with the State Bar; (3) You can also file a complaint in the Small Claims court to force repayment of the money paid for which no services were provided. If you want, you or another attorney, can write a letter, using certified mail to insure it is received telling the BK lawyer that your parents are dissatisfied that the work was not properly done. If you send me a copy of the title report showing the liens still in place and if you give me the case number I can access PACER and review the docket history to see whether or not the BK lawyer filed any motions to avoid the liens. You definitely need the help of an experienced BK lawyer to fix this.",
        "I know this isn't the answer you want to hear but you should call another experienced attorney to reopen the Chapter 7 and have the liens removed. Even though it may cost a reasonable fee it is worth it to remove the $30k so the house can be sold and go through escrow. After you did this or simultaneously you can report this attorney to the State bar or a fee arbitration panel and your parents may be able to obtain a refund of their monies for the work that was never performed. Hope this helps.",
        "Long term, you may be able to seek disgorgement of fees or make a complaint to the state bar. Those don't necessarily help you with your short term needs, though. For those short term needs, if you've lost all confidence in this attorney, it may be best to hire another lawyer to take care of the time-sensitive tasks that need to be done. That being said, it is possible in cases like these that all the hard work has been done, and some small administrative task is holding things up. If you think that might be the case, it might be best to just be persistent with the attorney. Have you tried setting up a face-to-face meeting that would force him to interact with you and answer your questions?\n\nI hope that is helpful; I hate hearing stories like this and hope that you are able to work it out quickly and with a minimum hassle.",
        "I'd hire someone new to get the work done, then go after a refund of fees paid for any work that wasn't done.",
        "Depending on the number of liens, you may find it cheaper to offer up $500 to $1,000 to the lien-holder to release the lien especially if time is of the essence in getting the sale of the house completed. Then you can go after the attorney for what it cost you.",
        "You might try calling his office again and letting them know you will be filing a formal complaint with the State Bar of California. This will probably get his attention. Since time is of the essence, consulting with a different attorney might be helpful. I'm sorry for your trouble. Good luck to you!"

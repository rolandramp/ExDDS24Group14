        "I agree with Mr. Steingraber. If you have assets in the U.S. then you can file BK In the U.S., wherever the assets are located. If you do not have assets in the U.S. and if you do not live in the U.S. then you likely cannot file in the U.S.",
        "Thats a great question, I would talk to a bankruptcy attorney in the US.",
        "If you don't live in the US you must have assets located in the US. If so, you can file bankruptcy in the jurisdiction where the assets are located."

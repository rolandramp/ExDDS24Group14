        "If you have lived there for ten years, you have undoubtedly contributed to the mortgage and the upkeep of the house which gives it huge community property component which would be subject to the bankruptcy laws even if you file alone. Discuss this with your lawyer and absolutely do not try to file bankruptcy without an experienced bankruptcy attorney. You have too much at risk.",
        "Do not file bankruptcy without consulting an attorney. Property acquired during marriage, even where title is taken in the name of one party alone, is presumed to be community property. 100% of community property is included in a bankruptcy filed by either spouse. The language you cite to in the deed may be sufficient to make clear that the property was your wife's separate property at the time of its acquisition. But if you have been married for 10 years subsequent to its purchase, the payments have been made with earnings presumably, and the earnings of married people are community property. In other words, almost certainly there is a community interest in the home. My colleague is right, you can protect equity in the home if you file bankruptcy, and the amount is currently $100,000 for a married couple, unless one of you is elderly, disabled, or you have a combined annual income in the past 12 months of less than $35,000. In that case, the homestead exemption can be as much as $175,000.",
        "You are correct that California is a community property state.\n\nCalifornia has a set of exemption laws that you can use to protect property you wish to keep when you file a Chapter 7 bankruptcy case. The amount of equity that can be protected in a home varies depending on circumstances. This is important enough that you should speak with a bankruptcy attorney in your area to get a personalized answer.\n\nIt is not likely that you will be able to have an in-person consultation right now, but I suggest calling around to see if you can find an LA area attorney to have a phone consult with about this matter."

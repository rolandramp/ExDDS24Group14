        "A corporate shareholder is generally not personally liable for the debts and obligations of the corporation, even if those debts are owed to the Franchise Tax Board.\n\nA shareholder can, however, be held personally liable under the \"alter-ego\" theory of liability if he failed to run the corporation as a separate legal entity. This can occur when shareholders fail to distinguish their personal finances from that of the corporation, and do not comply with corporate formalities.",
        "It does not make any difference whether your corporation was a C or an S Corporation. Even in an S corporation, liability for taxes and other obligations do not pass through to the shareholders.\n\nYou will only have liability to the extent that you received corporate assets, barring alter ego or transferee liability issues. As a practical matter, the Franchise Tax Board doesn't often pursue shareholders for failure to pay corporate taxes.",
        "The post at the link below addresses the issue that you are raising. Here is the most important sentence:\n\n\"Assuming that you go through the dissolution process properly and that you do not have any 'alter ego' problems, your personal liability generally will be limited to the amount of any distributions that you received at the time of dissolution.\"",

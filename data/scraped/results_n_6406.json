        "Excellent answer by Mr. Jacobson. You should also be advised that you do not owe taxes on an LLC; the LLC does. Since it is a limited liability entity, the owners are not liable for its debts such as taxes, unless the owners took a distribution of assets at a time when the LLC was insolvent, or which made it insolvent."

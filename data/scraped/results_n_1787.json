        "More information would need to be provided to give you a better idea of whether or not you should file bankruptcy. However, if you have lost everything, bankruptcy will not help you. Filing a bankruptcy will discharge your debts, it will not create new income or restore any property that you have lost.\n\nThere is no shame in filing bankruptcy. Abraham Lincoln, Ulsses S.

        "I agree with my colleagues that it is more important that you deal with a possible gambling addiction than filing for bankruptcy. Keep in mind, once you file for a Chapter 7 bankruptcy and get a discharge, you cannot file and get a discharge in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy again for 8 years from the date of the first filing. If an underlying issue with gambling is not dealt with, you could find yourself in a worse situation in the future even after having discharged these specific gambling debts in bankruptcy.",

        "My very first bankruptcy client had lost her money gambling. The good news was that she had already joined Gamblers Anonymous. After she received her discharge of debts, she truly had a Fresh Start. If you follow her example, you can truly start over. Your girlfriend deserves to know the real you, including the gambling debt and the fact that you are turning your life around (if in fact you are).",
        "As the other attorneys have pointed out, now is the time to take advantage of the free consultation most reputable bankruptcy attorneys provide and sit down with an experienced attorney to find out if bankruptcy is right for you. A complete financial analysis is necessary before a determination can be made as to whether or not bankruptcy is right for you, and if so, which chapter to file and when to file.",
        "Don't even think about filing bankruptcy until you have spent at least ninety days in Gamblers Anonymous. I have had several clients with gambling addictions and have found that filing bankruptcy to get a fresh start only works when the client wants to address the underlying reason why he or she needed to file bankruptcy in the first place. And tell your girl friend. She is going to find out anyway and a relationship based on a lie is no relationship.",
        "Much more needed to give you useful advice. I strongly suggest you click the Avvo tab \"Find a Lawyer\" and talk to 2 or 3. Many offer a free consultation. Take them up on it and you will get pointed in the right direction.",
        "Losing everything is not really a reason to file for Bankruptcy. It does not get those losses back. You mention nothing about your debt. As far as your girlfriend, if you want to make sure it doesn't last, keep secrets on important matters like money.",
        "Whether you should file bankruptcy or not depends on factors beyond your gambling issues. I'd recommend that you set up one or more consultations with local bankruptcy attorneys to discuss all of your options. You'll need to discuss your whole financial picture, but you should leave with a clear picture of your options.\n\nIf you file for bankruptcy, you will need to disclose your gambling losses as a part of that bankruptcy, so yes, your girlfriend will probably find out.\n\nNo bankruptcy, by itself, is going to eliminate the root gambling problem, though, so it may be that step one is to make sure you address the root problem as opposed to the symptoms. I wish you the best of luck."

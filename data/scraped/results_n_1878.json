        "Generally, there is 30 day response time from the date your employer was served with the writ of garnishment. If notice to your employer's payroll department and to the judgment creditor does not result in a withdrawal of the writ for garnishment, you should file an answer in the court case from which the writ of garnishment was issued.",
        "Only a judgment debtor or his/her spouse may have their wages garnished on an unpaid judgment. See below my link to options to a default judgment and the second link below discusses ways to lower or reduce a wage garnishment. For specific help on your garnishment, consult with a debt collection DEFENSE attorney immediately, as valuable rights expire soon, such as the right to set aside an invalid default judgment can expire in 90 days, and only an actual motion properly filed in court or a bankruptcy petition can stops that deadline from expiring. Also, if you file for a claim of exemption, you need to do that with the levying officer (usually county Sheriff's Civil Division), not with the court directly.",
        "First, let your employer know this is not you. Also contact the creditor and prove you are not the debtor."

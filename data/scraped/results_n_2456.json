        "Claiming a homestead is an issue involving your intention. I have had client's throw a sleeping bag on the couch of an empty home and as long as they intend to stay (as long as needed to obtain the homestead), they could claim the homestead the following morning.

        "Each state has its own homestead rules. For example in Washington, you are presumed to have a homestead where you live.

But the most important thing is to meet with an attorney as you asking this question means you have not. You care about 2 goals: keeping everything you have equity in and discharging all your debts. If you don't have any of the exceptions to discharge you will obtain that goal; most exceptions are set forth in 11 USC. 523 (Google it) like child support, some income taxes, traffic (in a ch 7) and criminal fines , and presumption of student loans.

        "As you know, you have to really and actually live in the property you're claiming as a homestead. Since the property is already vested in your name, you should be able to simply move back in BEFORE you file BK. If anyone (creditor, for example), knows your address is different, you may have a problem, but if you really move in, transfer the utilities back into your name, you should be OK. Be sure to check with a local BK lawyer in your area, but i think the rules are the same. Good luck to you."

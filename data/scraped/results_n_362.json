    "question": "I own a vape shop. The presidents recent comments and actions of other states has caused my sales to plummet 70%. I need out of the lease. Bankruptcy is an option. The problem is the lease is in mine and my fathers name, even though we write checks from the business, not personal checks. We did not sign a personal guarantee, but the lease is in our names....shouldn't the bankruptcy absolve us of any personal liability? We are an S corp.",

        "It does not seem like the lease is in the S Corp's name, if your name and your father's name is in the lease. It seems you would both need to file bankruptcy to eliminate the liability as to the lease. I recommend calling a couple experienced bankruptcy attorneys and having them review the lease for you and give you your options.",

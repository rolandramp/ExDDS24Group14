        "Many bank account funds are exempt from levy. For example, if the the source of the funds in your account was Social Security, other public benefits, or alimony or child support, these are generally exempt. There are many other exemptions.\n\nIf you have no account, then there is nothing for the levying officer to execute. The writ is supposed to be delivered by the levying officer to the bank officer to take your money, but if you have no account, then to whom did the levying officer deliver the writ? I don' t understand why you believe that you need to respond in this situation. You should consult with the local legal services office in your area at a clinic."

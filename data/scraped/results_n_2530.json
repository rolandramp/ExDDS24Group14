        "Generally speaking, a private creditor cannot garnish your unemployment benefits. However, once the money is in a bank account you need to be careful because a creditor can serve a levy on your bank, which will then freeze the account and give you a little bit of time to demonstrate that the funds are exempt from levy. It would make sense to keep as little money as necessary in your account.",

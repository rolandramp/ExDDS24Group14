        "It is not as simple as you try to make it sound. There are more factors that need to be considered other than the mere value of the furniture.

He normally would auction the items off, which the auctioneer typically receives a 15% commission (or more). He also has to pay you the exempt portion of the furniture, which often is the majority, if not all of the value of the furniture.

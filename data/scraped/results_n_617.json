    "question": "I'm trying to file for bankruptcy and want to pass the means test and get a chapter 7. In the past, my wife and my annual income would be too high to qualify for a chapter 7, but my wife gave birth to my daughter in the last 6 months, and went on disability and received disability pay.",

        "No. Simple as that. But asking means you have not sat down with an experienced bankruptcy attorney DO SO NOW. You may beat the MT on the expense side, can try and overcome the presumption or possibly reduce the INCOME side based on possibly retirement contributions or loan repayments depending on the Judges in your DIstrict on that issue too.

But the most important thing is to meet with an attorney as you asking this question means you have not. You care about 2 goals: keeping everything you have equity in and discharging all your debts. If you don't have any of the exceptions to discharge you will obtain that goal; most exceptions are set forth in 11 USC. 523 (Google it) like child support, some income taxes, traffic (in a ch 7) and criminal fines , and presumption of student loans.

    "title": "Am I liable for my ex-husband's debt incurred under his sole proprietorship which he owns soley?",
    "question": "We separated in July 2010 and our divorce was finalized in August 2011. My ex-husband owns a sole proprietorship which I don't have any involvement and has used our address as his mailing address since he started the business when we were still together. Now I just got a collection letter addressed to the name of his busines and then on the 2nd line my first name without my last name on it. Should I call the collection agency and explain to them that we are divorced ? Am i liable for whatever they are collecting from him?",

        "California Family Code section 910 states that you are liable for \"community\" debts incurred by your spouse \"during the marriage.\" The operative date is the date of separation, not the date when the court enters the divorce decree. Do not believe any legal advise that a debt ollector gives you. You now-ex's business may have been his separate property during marriage, depending upon the circumstances and evidence. Did the creditor rely upon your separate credit when it extended credit to the business?\n\nI do not think that you should telephone the debt collector. Instead, write to them, saying that you dispute your liability on the debt and asking that they send you a copy of the whatever document(s) they have which supports their claim that you are responsible. Also, demand the name (legal name not just the dba) and address (street address, not just a PO Box) of the original creditor.\n\nYou should also check your credit with each of the three credit reporting agencies. You can get a copy of your credit report for free one time each year, but you have to avoid their attempts to sign you up with a credit monitoring or credit protection service. The free, really free, link to your free credit report is usually the smallest and most obscure link on their website. You can also get a copy for free if you apply for credit and are turned down. That creditor will send you a turn-down letter with the name of the credit reporting agency.\n\nIf the account is on your credit report, you should dispute it with the credit reporting agencies.\n\nAfter you have done this, and assuming that your now-ex has not resolved the matter, consult a lawyer. You may have a good lawsuit against the debt collector for violations of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. The FDCPA provides for recovery of \"statutory damages\", actual damages for distress, aggravation, credit damage, etc., and attorney's fees.\n\nFinally, do not pay the collector one cent. They will consider your payment to be an acknowledgment that you are liable for the entire amount. Do not give them access to your bank account. Do not believe them if they threaten to sue. They cannot threaten to sue you unless they have consulted a lawyer in your jurisdiction who has personally reviewed the file. Do not give them any information. That is why it is not a good idea to talk with them. The debt collector is not interested in whether or not you are responsible, he/she only wants money. If you limit your communications to written communications, you will have a record of the communications.\n\nRichard Scott Lysle",
        "Your name was not on these accounts regarding your ex's business, so I don't know that you are liable and you don't know if these debts were incurred before your separation or after. The reference of these debts in your marital dissolution papers or divorce decree will help you to answer this question, as all debts should have been accurately described, so that all parties and the court can verify that the community assets and debts have been properly divided. You should also speak with your family law attorney about this situation, perhaps he or she can assist you to answer this question.\n\nWith this understanding and lack of information, I would suggest that you send the debt collection agency a letter disputing the debt and asking for verification. It is possible that the debt is not a consumer debt, if it was a debt incurred for your ex-husband's business, thus the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act would not apply. Until you are satisfied that this is a community debt of yours, I would caution you against agreeing to pay any part of this debt.

Dispute the debt informing them that you are not responsible for it and make them prove otherwise. Make them validate the debt. If you are sued, fight. You are not responsible for his business debt unless the divorce decree says otherwise."

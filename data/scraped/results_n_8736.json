    "title": "CA Statute of limitations on an overdrawn bank account.",
    "question": "I recently started receiving calls from a debt collector regarding a bank account I opened in 2003 that became overdrawn and was closed by the bank. They told me they atemped to unsuccessfully serve me a subponea to my residence and if I did not make payment arrangements they would come to my job. They were unable to tell me the dates they attemped service and stated there is no court date yet (which makes me believe there is no subponea either). What is the statute of limitations on this type of debt? Can they still sue me? They told me the bank last added late fees in 2007 so thats the time the statute of limitations began. If they decided to continue adding fee does that reset the clock? Thank You",

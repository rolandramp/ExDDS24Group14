    "question": "To my shock and surprise, my bank account was levied by the CA Vehicle Registration Collection Franchise Tax Board for over $500 in 2013. It is for a car that I left at my mechanic's shop in 2007 when I left California. I left town quickly and dropped the car off at his shop. There were no payments due on the car. I have not driven, seen or know anything about it since the day that I left. I have not even inquired regarding what was done with the car. I would prefer not to talk with the mechanic, in fact.",

        "Unlikely you will receive refund of amount levied. Do contact CA DMV to determine why they levied, explain circumstances. Contact mechanic to determine what happened to vehicle. You may be entitled to a recovery from mechanic if he sold vehicle and sale proceeds exceeded amount you owed him.",
        "I doubt you will get your money back. You said this happened in 2013...why does it all of sudden mater now?\n\nIs there still money owed? The first step would be to call the entity that garnished your funds. However, there may be nothing to resolve.",
        "You need to contact the DMV to find out exactly what you need to do fix the problem, if it is still outstanding. This could be a reoccurring problem. Good luck."

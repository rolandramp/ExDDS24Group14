        "I agree with my colleagues that: (1) Your questions are beyond the scope of this venue, and (2) your questions are best answered in consultation with a tax/family law attorney. You can find/consult/hire a lawyer in your area using the Avvo feature \"Find a Lawyer\". Make a list of 4-5 having many 5 star reviews from satisfied clients. If you don't get a prompt call back from one, go on to the next on your list. Some offer a free consultation by phone or in person. Take us up on it.\n\nThat said, taxes owed as a result of a jointly prepared, signed, and submitted tax return are a community debt.",
        "Income tax liability is usually considered community debt which means you are both liable for the tax debt. Seek more information from a CPA regarding your specific situation.",
        "This question is far too complicated to be adequately addressed in an online forum. I hope your tax guy is either a CPA or a licensed attorney as anyone else will just be guessing. Sure would have helped had you indicated whether you filed joint tax returns with your spouse. Hope this perspective helps!"

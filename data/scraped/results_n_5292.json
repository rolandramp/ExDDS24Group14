    "title": "How to get a copy of original promissory note from Sallie Mae?",
    "question": "My new spouse has some old private student loan debt. For 4 months, I have been trying to contact Sallie Mae for a copy of the original promissory note that was signed over ten years ago. All of my attempts at communication have been deflected to collection agencies who have told me that they can't provide that information. I have called, e-mailed, and sent letters by USPS certified mail asking for documentation and have heard nothing back. The woman I spoke to on the phone from the collections agency \"Legal Recovery Law Office\" told me that she is not allowed to send me that information because my account is set to go into litigation soon, and that all attempts at contacting Sallie Mae will just be redirected to her LRLO.",

        "I think I should point out that, with respect to this obligation, YOU have absolutely no right to this information. Only your spouse has a right to obtain it whether or not a lawsuit has been filed.",
        "Outside of litigation, there is no way to compel them to produce those documents involuntarily.\n\nIf you have leverage, like if you say you won't pay unless, then maybe they will.",
        "Make sure your request is in writing. If they do not have the original paperwork that could be a real problem for them.",
        "If they sue you, you can get a copy of it in the process known as discovery, in particular a Request for Production of Documents. Before being sued, perhaps you can ask the financial aid office where she attended school if they have a copy. Sometimes they keep these files for many years.\n\nIf sued on this debt, she will be well advised to retain an attorney who regularly handles debt collection lawsuits, as perhaps the case can be settled for an affordable amount. Many students loan account files have inadequate documentation. Please see the videos on the home page of my website, which overviews options if she is sued, but bankruptcy is NOT likely available to her.\n\nRobert Stempler (please see DISCLAIMER below)\nwww.StopCollectionLawsuits.com\nwww.facebook.com/SoCalConsumerLawyer\nTwitter: @RStempler"

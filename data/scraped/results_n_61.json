        "The short answer is yes. The long answer is it depends. It's best to seek chapter 7 because you can discharge (zero out the debt) the most debt. If you qualify for Chapter 7 in CA, under the new exemption laws, that can be a very good solution. Please act before plaintiff obtains a judgment. A judgment decreases you chances of discharge.",

        "I urge you to talk with an experienced bankruptcy attorney (some of us offer a no charge half hour consultation) as soon as possible. There is a lot of information that needs to be discussed and analyzed to determine if bankruptcy is your best option - including the fact that you co-signed on other vehicles. Being a \"nice person\" to help others is not necessarily the best way to help - particularly when it deals with financial issues. If your sister did not also sign on the agreement - you are the only one on the hook. If both of you signed, the creditor will pursue you both. Don't wait to get the information you need until you are served with a lawsuit.",

        "How much are you earning as a professional co-signer? No enough, I'm sure. In my opinion, just because you agreed to be responsible for the rent if the occupant doesn't pay doesn't make you responsible for fire damages. I'm sure the LL has fire insurance so why is the tenant being sued?",

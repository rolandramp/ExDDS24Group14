    "title": "Is it possible to close LLC but still keeping company banking account for paying office rental purpose?",
    "question": "We are in the process of closing our LLC. But our office lease is up to next April. The rental management office wants the money from our company account. We have a sub-lease but that sub-leasing company only wants to pay the rental to our company account. So, is it possible to keep the LLC company banking account but close LLC?",

        "No, it seems the LLC accounts remain active as does the LLC lease, so the entity should not be \"closed\". There are still active debts and obligations of the LLC through at least April that cannot be wrapped up. Wind up the business as you must, but until that is finished you cannot do a final accounting or \"close\" the LLC books.",
        "I've never tried it, but the following approach - based on the fact that dissolution in CA is a two-step process (please see the post at the link below) - should work:\n\n- The members vote to dissolve the LLC and file a Certificate of Dissolution.\n- At this point, the LLC stops its business activities, and it exists solely to wind up its affairs (e.g., makes a final payment to the Franchise Tax Board).\n- The bank account is retained, and - as part of the winding-up process - the LLC receives sub-lease payments and forwards the money to the landlord.\n- In April, once the final payment is made, the account is closed and the Certificate of Cancellation is filed. At this point, the LLC's existence terminates.\n\nDisclaimer: This post does not constitute legal advice and does not establish an attorney-client relationship."

    "question": "IF the corporation has an illegal set up or is being run improperly can you bypass sueing the Corporation and sue the individual that owns it instead. I'm talking about probably a professional corporation?",
    "answers": [
        "If you have standing to sue, I wouldn't bypass suing the corporation, I would consider suing both legal entities as two separate parties at the same time, in the same lawsuit. While one party may have the capability to remove itself from the lawsuit after a hearing, your tactic ensures that you're going to get the responsible party as a named defendant. You haven't provided enough information for us to determine which party would be the most appropriate.\n\nBased on what you've mentioned (or failed to mention), you may lack standing to sue the corporation/individual. Corporations are frequently set-up incorrectly and run incorrectly, but there are a limited number of people that (know about or) are actually harmed by this activity. If you're a shareholder of the corporation, you may bring a lawsuit if you qualify under California's derivative lawsuit statutes before you can file a lawsuit, and your damages would be limited. If you've entered into a business relationship with the corporation/individual, e.g. client, employee, creditor, vendor, etc., you may also have standing pursuant to the terms of the business relationship and the duties established pursuant to California law, and the terms of the business relationship may (or may not) limit the damages you may recover.\n\nIf you're not a shareholder nor have any relationship with the corporation, and you've observed or know about wrongdoing, you may lack standing to file a lawsuit short of special provisions in the law, however, you have other recourse options to write a complaint to the appropriate licensing authority, the California Attorney General or even law enforcement if the conduct is in violation of the penal code.\n\nIn short, you must be in a position where the corporation/individual has a duty to you, there was a violation of such duty, and you have been harmed. If you don't meet these requirements, your options are seemingly limited to filing a lawsuit, but you may want to hash-out all of the details with your attorney before you make your final determination.\n\nBest of luck.",
        "yes, you can. Generally, however, you would file a lawsuit naming both the corporate entity and the individual officer. When you sue the individual directly, it is termed \"piercing the corporate veil\". Generally, when evaluating if the corporate veil should be pierced, courts look at the following factors:\n\nCorporate Formalities - Did the corporation follow proper procedure, for example in its formation and appointment of directors, issuance of stock, the holding of its annual meetings, the filing of annual reports with the state, and the maintenance of its own property, and financial books and accounts? Or were the procedures not followed, was the corporation dependent on property or assets of a shareholder which it did not technically own or control, or were the corporate finances commingled with those of its shareholders?\n\nIndividual Control - What amount of financial interest, ownership and control did the principals maintain over the corporation?\n\nPersonal Use - Did the principals use the corporation to advance personal purposes?\n\nIf the court examines those factors and concludes that there is such unity of interest between the corporation and its shareholders that they are inseparable, and it would be unjust to permit the corporate form to stand, a court will typically pierce the corporate veil.\n\nFraud\nA court may also pierce the corporate veil to prevent a fraud, where the corporation is found to be a \"sham\" meant to facilitate fraud against third parties. If the corporation was set up, for example, to shield its owners from liability over a fraudulent real estate deal, and the owners siphon out the corporate assets such that the corporation is unable to compensate the victims of the fraud, a court is likely to set aside the corporation and allow the victims to recover from the personal assets of the owners.\n\nThese issues are very complex, however, and it is strongly recommended that you seek an attorney to draft the complaint for you as you will have to deal with a number of complicated arguments from the defendants as to why the Court should not pierce the veil.\n\nGood luck.",
        "Ms. Anwari's answer, above, is excellent, and the tactic of suing an individual for liability for the corporation's debts or actions is called piercing the corporate veil. In California, an individual or another company can be held liable for the debts, obligations and actions of a corporation, as an 'alter ego' of that corporation, when certain circumstances exist.\nYou are entitled to allege that the individual is the alter ego of the corporation, but it is your obligation during the lawsuit to prove the facts to establish that, which is not necessarily easily done, and there are many different circumstances and situations under which you could be successful. Your question indicates a belief that the corporation has an 'illegal set up', which may mean that the corporation does not properly exist, or that it has been suspended or dissolved in California for one of many possible reasons. You should check the Secretary of State, Department of Corporations website for the current status of the corporation.\nAs to being improperly run, I do not know what you mean, but if the corporation's assets are being improperly used by the shareholder as though they are his own, or if the corporation and the shareholder are not observing the rules required to maintain their existence as separate entities, you may have a good basis to succeed against the shareholder.\nI suggest you consult an attorney to review the facts available before filing this action, and you will likely need his or her assistance in proving the facts necessary to succeed on this type of claim.\nBest of Luck.",
        "The short answer to your questions is YES - you can sue the individual shareholders (owners) of a corporation instead of the corporation itself. This is called \"piercing the corporate veil\" and a court will allow it in certain situations. California courts in particular are more likely to allow you to sue the owners of a corporation where there has been some type of wrongdoing.\n\nYour best bet to increase your chances of recovering damages (money) in a lawsuit is to name both the corporation and its owners in your suit.\n\nFinally, if it is a professional corporation, the fact that the professional (doctor, lawyer, accountant) has formed a corporation will not prevent him/her for being personally liable for malpractice.\n\nGood luck with your suit."

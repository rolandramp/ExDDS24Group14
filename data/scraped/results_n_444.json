    "title": "Can a bankrupt corporation continue to be sued?",
    "question": "A creditor was suing a corporation debtor in state court. The corporation filed for chapter 7 bankruptcy and the case is now closed. The creditor, in the lower court case, now wants to depose the CEO of the bankrupt corporation. Can he do that? If so, is it by subpoena or by a notice of deposition in the pending lower state court case?",
    "question_tags": "Bankruptcy,Debt,Bankruptcy and debt",
    "answers": [
        "There is no discharge for a corporate Chapter 7 debtor. Only individuals can get a Ch. 7 discharge.\n\nSo the answer is yes, yes and yes. The creditor can also request a debtor's examination.",

        "A corporation cannot receive a discharge of debts in a Ch7 BK ... so if the case is closed, and the automatic stay has been lifted, the creditor is free to go after the corporation.\nHowever, there is likely nothing there to go after because the Ch7 would have liquidated any non-exempt assets, if any.\nIf creditor's purpose, however, is to \"pierce the corporate veil\" and hold the CEO responsible for the corporate debts, they may proceed."

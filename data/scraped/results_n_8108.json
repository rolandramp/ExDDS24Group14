    "question": "a monetary gift. Since I've been living in the home and don't want to sell it, I refinanced the home and got the title changed into my name in order to take equity out in order to pay him.

        "Was probate opened? The credit card companies have one year from date of death to file a claim for payment in your parent's probate estate (meaning the last person who passed away). If a probate is not opened, meaning you were able to transfer the house into your name without probate, then the credit card company has to open probate themselves. You have no obligation to pay the debt until they open probate. If they do not open probate within one year, then the debts are forever barred from being collected.\n\nIf probate was opened, or if a creditor opens probate and files their claim for payment, then you would need to either pay the credit cards or negotiate.\n\nBy the way, credit card companies routinely negotiate this type of debt.

        "Sadly, I cannot speak to your direct issue, as the answer may differ from California to Texas. But your question raises two possibilities. Either the credit card debt is yours, in which case your creditors may seek collection from you for failure to pay. Or, the credit card debt belonged to your parents, and you're wondering if you are obligated to pay those debts before making the gift to your son. Again, while the answer may differ significantly in California, specific monetary gifts in a Texas Will are generally protected from being poached in order to satisfy debts of the decedent -- they are typically the last to be used for such things.\n\nAt the same time, it sounds like the cash that you have received from the equity loan would hardly be considered an asset of the Estate, and thus maybe not liable for any debt of the Estate.

If the Estate did not own any other assets, and assuming the credit card debt is your parents', their creditors may be left looking at no assets to recoup their debt with."

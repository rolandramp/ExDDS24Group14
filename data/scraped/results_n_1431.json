    "title": "What happens if I do not open a probate for my mother's estate?",
    "question": "My mother died about a month ago and I am her only family. I know that her finances were messy and that she really only owned a small house in Riverside. I am not interested in the house nor her estate. Am I legally obligated to open a probate case for her? What happens to her property if I never claim it?",

        "As stated you are not legally obligated to open probate and you can just let the house go back to the bank. The only way I would recommend that would be if the debts are more than the assets and/or the house is worth less than what is owed on it. If there are assets, you can always hire a probate attorney to deal with the mess for you so that you at least get the benefit of any monies left over. Probate attorneys are paid from the estate (not you personally) and not until the end of the probate, so if there are assets, you have nothing to lose by having an attorney take you through the process. Good luck.",
        "A creditor of your mother, like a medical center say if there was a large unpaid bill could open probate to sell the house and obtain payment of the bill. If so, your mother's heirs would end up with any excess money. If no one takes any action, then the mortgage holder will eventually foreclose or if there is no mortgage, the house will eventually be sold for back property taxes.",
        "Excellent advice from colleagues. Some observations;\n-you are not obligated to open probate;\n-may be in best interest to open probate to deal with creditors, resolve title to assets, including real property;\n-wait one year if there are creditors before opening probate;\n-certain government claims entitled to priority;\n-if you do nothing, public administrator may file probate to resolve outstanding estate liabilities",
        "There is no obligation to file the probate. If there are creditors and that is a concern, I always instruct my clients to wait one (1) year after death and then file the probate. The reason is creditors have one (1) year from the date of death to file their claims otherwise they are void. The only claims that are excluded are the Franchise Tax Board and the Department of Health Care Services. Waiting the one (1) year will make your mother’s estate less messy. If you do nothing, then the public administrator may file the probate if there is money owed them for burial or the county will take the property back after five (5) years for delinquent property taxes. The probate will be easy after the year period and at the very least if you do not want the money you can always donate it to charity. The other alternative is to appoint the attorney as the personal representative and they will complete the entire probate process and you do not have to do anything. I have found this allows the heirs to be free of the stress and unknown of probate. I hope this helps.",
        "You are not legally obligated to probate the estate. If no one steps forward, then a creditor could step forward to probate it and claim their debt along with the fees or any other person in the family or just other person with ties to the family could step forward. If no one does, then the public guardian's office will step forward. Any assets would be distributed to the legal heirs but the heirs could disclaim the estates proceeds and in that sense, after paying off all debts, the estate would \"escheat\" to the state of California."

    "title": "How would I get access to see where and what my US Trustee spent my estate on? Who holds them accountable?",
    "question": "I had been mislead by an attorney to file chapter 13 to save my house from getting it forecloses on. The 13 stopped the foreclosure so I was able to get the house finished, but the Attorney then transitioned it into a chapter 7 for some reason and because of a business lawsuit The attorneys on the other side would not let it out of the 7. The trustee then sold my house which I had $700k equity in. All my debts were around $300k Itâ€™s now been 6 years and I have no Idea what they did with all the money. I would like to be able to see how they squandered it and if they did I would like to sue them to get some back.",

        "While I agree with my colleagues that the information you're seeking concerning the first and final accounting of how the proceeds were distributed in the Chapter 7 case is to go to the court file, your account of what happened to you as the ring of \"The Perils of Pauline\".\n\nDon't get me wrong; there are both skilled and unfortunately unskilled attorneys out there, to which the caveat \"let the buyer beware\" regrettably is applicable. But there is also oversight by the court system itself. In other words, while your attorney was your advisor, the court must be satisfied that the actions being taken by your attorney as your agent were authorized by you as the principal.\n\nYour story suggests that you did not maintain open and effective lines of communication with your attorney. In any event, the diligent protection of your interest required you do something other than only look into the matter six years after the fact. You may be able to obtain a full accounting of the receipts and disbursements from the bankruptcy estate, but the opportunity to raise any objections you might have had to the accounting required you act many years ago. Failing to do so, it is likely you are without any remedy today.",
        "I always regret hearing about a client who had a bad experience with their lawyer. Most of the time it is due to miscommunication. If your lawyer actuallly did not perform his/her duties in a professional, ethical, and legal manner, redress is available in a malpractice scenario. The problem is why have you waited this long to explore your options. The Statute of Limitation has probably passed unless a competent lawyer can find an exception for you.",
        "Troy, I'm sorry to hear you had a bad experience. As the previous commenter said, records of how money was paid out in your bankruptcy can be obtained from the bankruptcy court. You can log on and access documents from both your cases at the PACER website (Public Access to Court Electronic Records). You will need to pay for records access at $0.10 per page, up to a max of $3.00 for a document of 30 pages or longer.\n\nOne aspect of your question is concerning, and that is that you felt you were misled and had no idea what was going on in either of your bankruptcy cases. Before you can file a bankruptcy case, you must sign the petition and schedules, and in those documents you swear and affirm to the bankruptcy court that you have read and agree with all the documents you are signing. The law presumes that if a person signs something, they have read and understand what they are signing. If you did not understand something at the time, that would've been a good time to raise the issue with your attorney so he or she could explain to you what you were signing, and you could sign the documents with knowledge of what you were doing. It doesn't really pass the smell test for someone to come back years later and blame their former attorney for results they don't like, when the person complaining pleads complete ignorance and takes no responsibility for their role in the process. If you hire another attorney in the future, I hope you read what you are asked to sign before you sign it, ask questions if you do not understand, and take responsibility for your decisions and the things you willingly sign your name to. If you do things without understanding what you're doing, that's really on you, not the attorney.",
        "The short answer is the Court, and you can check the Court record to see what was done. I am going to guess that if you moved to a 7 it was because your debts were such that to satisfy your creditors, you needed to liquidate rather than restructure. I am going to move this question out of Ethics and into BK so you can get a more specific response from the specialists."

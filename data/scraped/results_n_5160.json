        "File a claim of exemption, Cal.

I have done many motions to set aside for people and the facts are always different and what the judge needs to be convinced also depends on the situation. There is no cookie cutter, in my opinion, though some evidence is more persuasive than other evidence to many judges.

        "The reason that the Sheriff levied upon your bank account is because you were served with a Summons and Complaint in a lawsuit. You either went to court and lost, or you did not appear. The creditor is entitled to levy on all of your assets that are not exempt from execution. You can file a Claim of Exemption with the Sheriff if you need the money for necessities of life. You can file bankruptcy. If you were not properly served with Summons and Complaint, or have some other reason for not going to court, you can file a motion to vacate the judgment. You will need an attorney to prepare the motion papers because there is no pre-printed court form.\n\nYour attorney will need to review relevant documents in the court's file. These are public records that you can get by going to the courthouse."

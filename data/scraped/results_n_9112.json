        "I'm sorry that things didn't work out for you.\n\nUnlike a divorce, you can't get an annulment just because you haven't been married very long, and you don't like being married. You can only get an annulment for one of a fairly specific list of reasons, and getting an annulment, even if you're entitled to one, is a more complicated process than dissolving the marriage.\n\nIf you and your wife agree to dissolve the marriage, have limited assets and debts, and no children of the marriage, you may qualify for a \"Summary Dissolution\", which is intended to be a simple \"do-it-yourself without a lawyer\" dissolution (divorce). The instructions and forms are available online (see below) or at your local courthouse.\n\nGood luck, and thank you for your service to our country."

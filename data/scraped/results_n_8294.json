    "title": "Have over 300k in positive equity in my home. Can I file for BK ?",
    "question": "I'm a single mother with only child support income coming into the household. I'm self employed but the economy has driven me to be broke. I have no income to catch up with my bills besides the bare neccesities, I have horrible credit and can't qualify for a home equity or a refi to help me pay off the deliquent accounts. Could I qualify for a BK (13) without losing my home?",

        "To keep your home, you would need to pay the Chapter 13 Trustee an amount equal to the amount of equity that isn't protected by California exemptions.\n\nGo to the state website to review these exemptions - California has two formulas, one under CCP 303 and another under CCP 304. You will pick the one that is most advantageous to you.\n\nYou will never have to pay more than 100% of your debt (except for attorney fees & trustee commission), and if you are required to pay 100% due to the amount of equity in your home, you will be paying the unsecured creditors at 0% interest. So if you have high interest debt, you could save a lot of money & pay off everything over 5 years.\n\nBut can you afford to do this? Take your total debt & divide it by 60. Add on at least an extra $100 for trustee fees & attorney fees. Can you afford this payment? If so, you may be able to solve your debt problem with a Chapter 13.\n\nHope this perspective helps & good luck!",
        "It's a complex process to determine if you can fund a Chapter 13 plan that works for you and also fulfills the requirements for paying your creditors. It depends of many factors in your financial situation. You need to consult with a qualified bankruptcy attorney in your area.",
        "Chapter 13 bankruptcy allows individuals to repay their debt and keep items that they would not be able to keep in Chapter 7. The biggest issue in Chapter 13 cases is feasibility. If the proposed plan works then you should be just fine. I suggest meeting with an attorney in order to figure out if you can fund the Chapter 13."

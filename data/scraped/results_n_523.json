    "title": "Does bankruptcy excuse all lawsuits?",
    "question": "I'm suing a woman for perjury & fraud. She helped another individual file paperwork in court full of lies against me including my forged signature on a form. The other individual obtained orders in their favor for this fraud. They never even served me the complaint & summons, but they lied saying I was personally served. I now have to look for an attorney for my case to vacate the judgement. I am a single mother. It's not fair that I have to spend $5,000 for an attorney to fix the damages they caused when that money could be used on my child. The other individual had the audacity to calls police on me & file a police report for not following his fraudulent orders. If I win my case & they both have to pay my attorney fees & other fees that will be discussed at the hearing can this woman use the excuse of her filing for bankruptcy around Feb 2019 as an excuse not to pay? Our court hearing is on July 2019.",

        "Why don’t you wait until she files a bankruptcy. Then take all court papers and bk filings and have them reviewed so a competent attorney can give you a meaningful course of action. Otherwise, your concerns cannot be addressed in the abstract",
        "You do not write about the purpose of the July hearing. If it concerns a case you have filed, you need to be aware that the automatic stay issued by the bankruptcy court prevents you from proceeding with that case unless the stay is lifted or expired by operation of law.\n\nNot all debts are discharged in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy, but you must make a timely motion in bankruptcy court to prevent a discharge.\n\nPosting here on Avvo will not help you, nor will the “unfairness” of the situation. You need to consult a bankruptcy attorney to determine how to proceed.",
        "you should be able to do the application (motion) to vacate or reverse the default judgment by filing a simple brief stating the fact (that you were never served that it is axiomatic that a person not served is not within the authority of the court) and attaching the same simple affidavit by you that you were never served."

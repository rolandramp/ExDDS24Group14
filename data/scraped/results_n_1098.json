    "question": "I filed for bankruptcy and had an adversary preceding filed against me. The loans were \"consolidation loans\". The credit union is alleging I got the loans with the intention of increasing my debt as opposed to consolidating my debt because I used some of the funds for other things instead of soley paying off other credit cards. They also alleged that I did not qualify for personal loans. I plan to defend this by showing my intent, showing any other use of their funds wasn't a proximate cause of me filing BK or cause of their loss and disproving justifiable reliance citing old case law.",

You deposited the check, that is your assent. You don't mention if you ever made a payment on this loan, but if you did, that is also evidence that you understood and assented to the loan. At most, if you are lucky, you may be able to get out of some of the specific \"terms\" contained in the written document (like, paying their attorney fees if you lose), but that defense only works if the agreement is \"required\" to be in writing by the statute of frauds (which wouldn't apply).",

As for loan documents and applications, they have to give you whatever they have through the discovery process. As for an unsigned document, it's some evidence but not everything. The court will have to try to decide what the contract terms were, but if you deposited the check, that's evidence that you accepted a good portion their loan agreement. They were sloppy so you may be okay, but those without attorneys often make mistakes. If you're unable to pay for an attorney, some courts may be able to assign a volunteer attorney if they have such a program.",

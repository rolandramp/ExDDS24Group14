        "Using a fake social security card is criminal fraud which can get you sent to prison and put you at the head of the list for deportation. Filing for bankruptcy will entail a huge risk for you. I don't recommend it.",
        "You will be committing perjury by filing BK using a fake SS#. It is not the BK that exposes you to immigration trouble, it is the felony of knowingly committing perjury of a material fact. Fines, prison time and deportation await you. Plus, since this is a public forum, your location, your admission of fake SS#, and possible BK filer are excellent clues the US Trustee/Dept of Justice will use to find you. I would keep a low profile if I were you. Any lawyer who represents you in perpetrating your lies could be disciplined as well.",

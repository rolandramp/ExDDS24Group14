    "title": "In a CA chapter 7 bankruptcy, can I use my 29 yr old daughter as a dependent for means test household size? No job, I support",
    "question": "So she is 29 and presently and for a while has not been working. I pay for all her daily needs but don't / can't claim on taxes. What would be the trustee response from listing her as an added dependent and thereby increasing household size for means test purposes?",
    "answers": [
        "Is there a compelling reason why you MUST file BK now or might it make sense to wait 3 mos, claim daughter on 18 return and file after? Like other counsel says, it is not imperative to have claimed the person on dependent on return especially if you can show she has no income, lives with you and you have been supporting her and likely will for an extended time. Will the household income increase in the next 3 mos? Are you certain that you cant pass the meams test even without claiming her? Means test takes practice and it is part math, part art, knowing how your local trustee office interprets certain expenses is one trick. Sometimes changes and passage of time can help a debtor pass the test. In my humble opinion we are worth the expense, sometimes lawyers file BK and they too hire BK lawyers instead of DIY.",
        "Typically, claiming a dependent on your tax return shows the trustee viable evidence that you in fact had a dependent prior to filing bankruptcy. However, just because you did not claim a person as a dependent on your previously filed tax return does not necessarily mean that person is not a dependent of yours.\n\nHowever, the bankruptcy code looks to similar factors for who a dependent is as does the IRS.

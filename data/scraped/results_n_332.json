        "The above attorneys are correct in their analysis regarding community property. Essentially, you cannot be made to pay, but your assets can be used to pay, including wage garnishment for debts taken out in your husband's name, while in marriage. With the exception to federal student loans as the other attorney stated.",
        "Federal Student Loans incurred by one person will always be their sole responsibility, regardless of where they live. You will never be obligated to pay your spouses Federal Student Loans because they are governed by Federal Law, not state law.\n\nIf you have co-signed on a Private Student Loan, then yes. As for the credit cards, they are his responsibility, but you may be held liable if a family law judge orders some sort of contribution.",
        "The California statutes that deal with this are Family Code sections 910 and 911. It should be clarified that your earnings may be garnished for his debt the debt is incurred during marriage and you are not separated. You are probably aware that student loan debt is not dischargeable.",
        "You are not personally liable for your husband's debts that are only in his name.

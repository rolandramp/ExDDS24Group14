    "question": "I tried to arrange a re-payment agreement with the company but they will not stop charging me fees. I will not ever be able to repay them. I am sure they will sue me in court eventually, what chances do I have of winning and not having to repay them? I heard that some installment loan companies operate illegally in California, would you know if Cash Call and Advance America are some of them?",

        "Filing a lawsuit, small claims or otherwise, requires the plaintiff to voluntarily subject itself to the jurisdiction of your local court. Most on line lenders are not interested in filing lawsuits, because they are then subject to any counterclaims you might bring. Many of them are based on Indian reservations, where they can claim immunity in lawsuits against them, but that is not available if they start a lawsuit against you in your local court. They feel they can break local and state laws in their debt collection efforts, as long as they never have to deal with the state and local courts. If an action is actually brought (unlikely), you need an attorney well versed in the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. Since the Act allows for the recovery of attorney fees, you can likely consult with one free to review you situation.",

Because you haven't paid them?\nRather than worrying about what will happen if you are sued and whether your case can be dismissed due to some far-fetched legal theory, focus on what is in your control and what is actually happening.

You should schedule a consultation with an experienced bankruptcy attorney in your community to discuss all of your bankruptcy and non-bankruptcy options for dealing with this debt and others, if applicable.

        "Do not believe anything that a debt collector tells you. Payday lenders and other high interest lenders rarely file lawsuit. Instead they just threaten and annoy people.

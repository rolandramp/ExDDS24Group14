        "If an Abstract of Judgment is filed in the County Recorders Office it will remain a lien on your house and any other real property in your name for at least 10 years. The judgment will be worth nothing because of the bankruptcy (discharged debt) but if you try to sell the house the title company will want to have the lien removed by the creditor. The worthless lien will be a cloud (a dark one) on your title and imagine the problem of trying to clear that up many years from now. Therefore, your attorney has to file a motion to avoid the lien and the order avoiding the lien may have to be filed at the County Recorders Office. This should add approximately $600 to your case in attorney's fees unless the creditor objects and then requires more time by your lawyer to resolve the problem.",
        "The answer is that a judgment lien attaches to the house and does not automatically disappear. Some work needs to be done to get rid of the lien.

    "title": "How long does it take for the Judge to approve or sign the stipulation of dismissal? I have a case with a debt collector.",
    "question": "A debt was used under my name but not my social security. I have consulted a lawyer and the lawyer filed a stipulation of dismissal to the other party. But he or I did not attended a hearing, Instead the other party was the one that filed the stipulation of dismissal in front of the judge. Does this make sense? Now I am waiting for the judge to approve/sign? how long does this normally take? My set court date is in 3 weeks. Will this end before my hearing? What happens in the hearing?",

        "The answer regarding how long it takes depends upon whether this is a federal court case, or a state superior court limited jurisdiction case (Norwalk or Chatsworth), or a state superior court unlimited jurisdiction case. Normally, a stipulation of dismissal is only used in federal court. In state superior court, a plaintiff files a Request for Dismissal. Your post does not indicate why the case is being dismissed-- was it settled, or did the plaintiff just agree to dismiss because it was you were not the correct party?",
        "Not enough information. In particular, your post did not specify what court (State Superior Court or U.S. District Court), what type of party you were (plaintiff or defendant), or what the stipulation was agreeing to do? If this was in Cal. Superior Court, stipulations are rarely used for routine dismissal. A stipulation typically means that one party agreed to pay the other party payments, and at the end the case would be dismissed. Did you agree to make payments to the other side? Please ask your lawyer this question."

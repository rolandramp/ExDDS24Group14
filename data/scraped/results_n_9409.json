    "title": "Can I still cancel a short sale contract as a buyer after acceptance from bank, if not what are my options?",
    "question": "I waited 4 months for an answer to my offer in a short sale for a South lake Tahoe condo. After acceptance, I am asked if I would pay arrearages in HOA dues totaling $3100 as the bank is refusing to pay, along with any other outstanding debts which may include utilities. The bank has also paid property taxes in Nov. I then receive seller's disclosures to which all their answers are \"Don't Know.\" I am concerned about a lien being placed on the property and what unknowns await me since I have not received any disclosure at all. What are my options as the selling agent insists the current owner is an out of town landlord since purchasing 4 years ago and does not have the answers. Also, if both parties refuse to pay the HOA dues if the HOA does not waive it, who is legally responsible?",

        "If your offer didn't include the payment of delinquent HOA dues, utilities, and anything else you're now being asked to pay, that's a counteroffer to your offer, and you can say no. It's likely that either the bank will pay them or the HOA will waive them in order to get a new dues paying owner in the unit.\n\nAs for liens, have you received a title report on the property? If not, get one. That would disclose any liens.\n\nAs for the seller's lack of disclosures, you're right ot be concerned, but it may well be true that the owner knows nothing and only past renters know anything. You can ask the selling agent to ask the landlord for the renter's names, but they may not give them to you. You need to get your own inspector and make sure you're as fully informed about this property as possible, if you decide to go through with the sale.\n\nShort sales are complicated, and if you don't have a real estate agent experienced in short sales (the bank has to pay their commission, not you) or a lawyer helping you with this transaction, get one or both.\n\nDisclaimer: Please note that this answer does not constitute legal advice, and should not be relied on, since each state has different laws, each situation is fact specific, and it is impossible to evaluate a legal problem without a comprehensive consultation and review of all the facts and documents at issue. This answer does not create an attorney-client relationship."

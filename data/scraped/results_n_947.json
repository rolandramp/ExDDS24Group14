    "question": "I terminated a contract with Verizon. I was hit with early termination fees but we were able to agree on a monthly payment until paid. The amount had been $2,100 and I had $600 left as balance. I was making the full monthly payments as agreed too.",

        "Sorry this happened to you. Sounds as if someone did not read the notes. Unfortunately, they can charge off the debt. As the original creditor they are not usually subject to the FDCPA - there are a few exceptions. However,since the debt was in default when it was transferred, the collection agency is subject to the FDCPA. So, make sure the collection agency follows the rules. You will have 30 days to dispute the debt so make sure they have the correct balance that you owe. You may want to set up a payment plan with the agency to complete the payments. Finally, as indicated in the earlier reply, consider putting an explanation on your each of your credit reports explaining the agreement you thought you had with Verizon and the reason you fell behind. Good luck!",
        "If you were paying as agreed then I don't think they have any grounds to report the debt as a charge off but I'd want to review all the paperwork. California has a law to protect consumers from creditors reporting false or inaccurate information on their credit. Sounds like there might be a case. I would talk to an attorney and have them review your case.",
        "You have assumed that big corporatiosn play fair and don't make mistakes or lie to you. If you only owe $600, you should be able to negotiate a settlement with the credit compnay",
        "All creditors are required to report accurate information on your account. A charge-off does ding your credit score, but if that is what happened, I don't think you can compel Verizon to change it. That said, you do have the right to compel the national credit bureaus (Experian, Equifax, TransUnion) to include a \"consumer statement\" in which you can give your side of the story. The consumer statement will appear in your credit report and may mitigate/offset the negative reference to a charge off. Don't hire a credit repair service because you can do this yourself."

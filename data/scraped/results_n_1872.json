    "title": "How do I get the maximum amount of relocation money for my condo in foreclosure after having a Chapter 7 BK discharged?",
    "question": "I am permanently disabled and my condo is in foreclosure. I was denied a loan modification. The value of my condo is now about $200,000 less than my mortgage balance, due to the decline in market conditions. I need maximum relocation assistance. What is the best way to accomplish this? Deed in lieu, short sale, letting the bank foreclose and get cash for keys? Other ways? Thank you very much!",

        "The buyer of the property at foreclosure sale may offer you \"cash for keys\" rather than spending a comparable amount on the eviction process. A deed in lieu of foreclosure agreement will most likely contain a terms requiring you to vacate the property quickly.

Therefore, foreclosure may be your best option from the standpoint of potentially obtaining funds that you can use to relocate.",
        "The most likely time that a bank will offer \"cash for keys\" is in a deed in lieu of foreclosure. Since you are already in a foreclosure the bank may not be willing to offer you any relocation assistance. Have you been saving the money you would have been paying for your mortgage payment? If you have, then that should provide some funds to relocate.",
        "All of those options require the agreement of the lender, who has less reason to do so if they are already in foreclosure. You can try to negotiate any one of those things, but getting money back is not part of any of them unless the bank agrees. Your relocation money's best source is the amount you have not been paying to the mortgage company, though there is always a chance that the bank will agree to one of the other options as well.",

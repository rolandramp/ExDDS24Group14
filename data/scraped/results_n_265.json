    "title": "What are my options when closing down my business due to Covid19 and I can't pay my suppliers?",
    "question": "I've tried negotiating with them and they're all just being so horrid and selfish. I've been an amazing business owner for 30 years, my credit is stellar. But now I've had to make the difficult decision to shut down my small restaurant because I've lost too much income with Coronavirus. I owe about $8,000 to various vendors and suppliers. What should do I? What's the worst that can happen if I just don't pay them? Any help would be very much appreciated. Thank you.",

        "You would need to have each contract reviewed. Generic options would be pay them, settle for less, ignore them let them sue for their damage, or talk to a bankruptcy attorney.",
        "My colleagues have given you good information and many things to think about, but I had to answer as well to congratulate you on your success in a very difficult industry and to share your sadness. With a comparatively small amount of debt - which is amazing - you can hold off on any bankruptcy filing - but may want to talk with an experienced bankruptcy attorney just to cover a few possible issues related to the closure of your business. Some of us offer a no charge half hour consult via phone for this purpose.",
        "Please excuse me as I DO commiserate with you and I truly believe you did in fact build a nice business, which is not an easy thing in the restaurant industry. Just surviving that long gets a blue ribbon! Still, 30 years in, you should have squirreled away some money for a rainy day. I cannot see going bankrupt over $8,000.00 since you have stellar credit either, so, I'd recommend, IF you walked into my door, that you negotiate the best deal you can on the funds and if it is in fact $8,000.00 only with no other debts, and they will not move, find a way to pay it and keep your stellar credit rating.\n\nAlternatively and maybe even a better idea, if you have a name that is good in the business, SELL your business. While you may have to do a \"fire sale\" there a good chance your physical assets alone are worth at least $8,000.00. If the name is a good one someone WILL pay for that name.\n\nBest of luck to you in these tough times",
        "I hope you will try to hang in there until you can open again. It's criminal (in my opinion) what over-reaching bureaucrats have done to the small business owners in America.\nWith the courts closed, there is very little heartless lenders can do to you - for a while at least. Can you offer curbside service? takeout? delivery?\n\nIf you end up having to close for good, you can file a bankruptcy at that time (or shortly thereafter) to discharge your responsibility to pay all debts, leases, etc.",
        "My colleagues have given you good advice. Basically, you have 3 options: (1) do nothing and expose yourself and your assets to liability when judgments are entered against you. If you own real estate with a sizeable equity, the creditors will record their judgments to become liens against your property; With proper asset protection, you may be able to shield some or all of your assets via a trust (2) If you have any cash, you can attempt negotiating to pay them lump sum settlements; (3) Depending on your overall debt load, filing a bankruptcy petition allows you to discharge certain unsecured debts with no payment to them.\n\nTry not to invade your retirement funds if you have any, because you will need cash to resume your enterprises after this mess is finished (provided our rookie politicians don't prolong the shutdown and offer socialism as a remedy).

        "You are not alone. I have been speaking with caterers, restaurant owners, and other folks in the food and hospitality industry. First question: Are you going to try to remain in business? Many folks have decided the future is too bleak to remain in operation. If you aren't going to continue business, then you may want to consider whether bankruptcy is a good option.

        "I am sorry to hear that you are having trouble with your vendors.

You may also have some sort of outstanding tax liability for your business.\n\nAny lawyer you talk to will want to know the form you do business in (corporation, sole proprietorship etc.) as well as the amounts that are owed to your various creditors. It is important to understand if you have made a personal guarantee on any of the debts or if only the business is liable for it. If there are personal guarantees, you should be prepared to discuss your personal assets as well as any corporate assets.\n\nThere are lots of very capable attorneys here in San Diego that can walk you through what you need to think about.

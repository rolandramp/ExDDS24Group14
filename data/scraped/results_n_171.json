    "title": "Relief from Automatic Stay?",
    "question": "I'm plaintiff, in pro per, against the same defendant in two different unrelated actions. Defendant filed bankruptcy and the automatic stay is in force. I just filed for relief from stay citing to only one of the cases because I'm further along in that one. If the relief is granted, does it automatically apply to the other case?",

        "I too urge you to consult with an experienced bankruptcy attorney in order to consider all related issues to your situation. Some of us offer a half hour no charge consultation which may result in a clear understanding of the direction you should take and why.",
        "You also beg the question as to whether relief will be granted for either. If the Debtor filed a chapter 7, and there is no insurance coverage, the likelihood of relief to pursue litigation is minimal. I would suggest that you contact experienced local counsel to determine if you have options in the bankruptcy court. In a chapter 7, time is short, so the sooner you seek one-on-one advice the better.",
        "I doubt the Order you are seeking based on the facts of one case will apply to another case. You are asking the judge to rule on another case not before him/her. The judge is not likely to do that. Now, I must tell you that you are in the middle of a legal minefield. Before you make a misstep, i urge you to do the following: Find/consult/hire a lawyer in your area using the Avvo feature \"Find a Lawyer\". Make a list of 4-5 having many 5 star reviews from satisfied clients. If you don't get a prompt call back from one, go on to the next on your list. Some offer a free consultation by phone or in person. Take us up on it.",
        "It might depend on the language in the order. You should bring it up at the hearing.\n\nIn the situation of state court litigation which commenced before the bankruptcy petition was filed, a stay is not terminated as to the creditor but only modified so that the litigation may proceed to a judgment or other resolution. After that you would be expected to go back to the Bankruptcy Court to request further relief before enforcing a judgment."

    "question": "I filed ch 7 in 2010. Now expecting a settlement from lawsuit. Being told the trustee wants the check unless I open BK again.",
    "answers": [
        "Contact your Bankruptcy attorney ASAP. Avvo is not a replacement for legal representation. Good Luck!",
        "Assuming the settlement is for a cause of action that arose prior to your 2010 bankruptcy it is an asset of the estate, even if you didn't know about it when you filed.\nThe trustee is not garnishing the settlement, he is asserting the estates interest in the cause of action. Yes, you need to talk to your chapter 7 attorney and discuss reopening your case and possibly exempting all or some of the settlement.\nGood luck.",
        "Look, you need to contact your attorney from that case immediately.\n\nThe answer to this question is absolutely dependent upon the property disclosure and corresponding exemptions from that case in 2010.",
        "Did you list the settlement or possibility of a settlement as an asset in your 2010 Chapter 7 case? If you did list that asset, then you should be able to claim all or part of the settlement as exempt, depending on how large the settlement and how much of available exemptions you have. If you didn't list the asset, then you might be able to claim an exemption in the settlement, as long as you can satisfactorily explain to the judge why that asset was not listed [assuming you didn't list it].",
        "Was the lawsuit for an injury caused by something that happened before you filed the bankruptcy petition in 2010?"

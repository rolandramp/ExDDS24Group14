    "question": "Can an answer to a complaint be considered served if the document has been shrinked so that it has 2 pages of pleading per single page? The font is very tiny and difficult to read. So im wondering if this would be still considered served as it is.",

        "My colleagues are correct. Plus, you can use the trusty magnifying glass.",
        "The trustee frequenlty serves documents that are not 100% actual size and on both sides of the paper. You have notice. You can download a better copy from Pacer.",
        "If the clerk accepted it for filing, its done. You received copies so you are served. Call the other side and tell them that you appreciate the effort to save trees but you would prefer full size copies. You can check California's rules for E-service also.\n\nGood Luck"

        "Your BK lawyer should have taken care of this during the time your case was opened. If you didn't use a lawyer in your BK, this is what happens to debtors who don't have the benefit of good representation. If you thought you could do this yourself and save money, it will now be time to pay an attorney to take care of this. If you still intend on doing this yourself, it is a very unwise decision. Here are the steps necessary to fix this:\n\n1. File a proper motion to reopen your case;\n2. If your motion to reopen is granted, prepare a proper order for the judge to sign;\n3. File a motion to avoid the lien(s), assuming you don't have any surplus equity beyond what you exempted;\n4. Serve the motion on all necessary parties; (special rules for service must be following including using certified mail to an officer of the creditor company;\n5. If no opposition is received, file a declaration of no opposition with the court;\n6. If your motion is granted, prepare a proper order for the judge's signature;\n7. Get a certified copy of the order from the clerk in the BK court;\n8. Record the certified copy of the order in the county where the original judgment lien was recorded.\n\nWithout any mistakes, this process usually takes about 60 days. If you make mistakes, the process will take a lot longer. Don't expect the judge to \"cut you any slack\" for mistakes. The judge will not act as your attorney and will hold you to the same standards as a BK lawyer. The BK judges don't like the extra time they must spend reading poorly drawn motions, detecting insufficient evidence, rejecting your paperwork for deficiencies, etc. This leads to the very likely outcome of dismissing your proceedings because the judge has too many other matters to resolve and won't take a lot of time fiddling around with pro se parties.",
        "The term \"charge off\" is simply an accounting practice whereby the debt is written off the books. This does not mean that the lien was extinguished or removed from the property. During the housing crisis, most banks did not encompass both the 1st and 2nd mortgages into one modification. If you have proof of this, present it to Citibank. More than likely, you didn't hear from Citibank because your house was under water. There was no equity over and above the 1st mortgage. The issue of being current with the 1st is not related to the 2nd mortgage. Creditors are not required to report to the credit bureaus. You have the following options:\n1. Refinance the house and payoff the 2nd mortgage.\n2. Pay the balance of $110,000 in full satisfaction.\n3. Negotiate a settlement with Citibank.\n4. Provide proof that the 2nd was included in the Modification.\n5. Convince Citibank that the 2nd mortgage should be extinguished.\n\nConsult with an attorney to help you with the process.",
        "welcome to mortgage lien law. You may have been released from personal liability on the second deed of trust when you filed bankruptcy, but the lien remained on your house. You are going to have to negotiate a settlement with CITI. I know of no other way. Maybe my colleagues do."

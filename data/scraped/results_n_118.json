    "question": "My ex will file a bankruptcy chapter 7 and he does not include his mortgage loan because he gave up his ownership and quitclaim deed and paper shows a house ownership is ex wife only.",
    "answers": [
        "Your husband will include the mortgage loan in his bankruptcy because that's the law. His personal liability will be eliminated if an Order of Discharged is entered by the court. The transfer of his interest in the real property must be disclosed on the Statement of Financial Affairs. A transfer may be voided by the Chapter 7 Trustee if transfer was made with actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud creditors or if debtor received less than a reasonably equivalent value in exchange for such transfer.",
        "See my prior answer also to your question. You still keep the home but his personal liability is discharged if he files and obtains a discharge. You just keep on paying the mortgage just like before ."

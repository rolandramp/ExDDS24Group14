    "title": "Is it legal for a moving company that I used in 2006 to put me into collections w/o ever notifying me? I did pay them.",
    "question": "Back in 2006 I used a moving company to move me from the Valley to Orange County.Movers arrived, gave a full assessment of how much it will cost me for their services.They wrote the amount on the invoice, I agreed. They moved my things, I fed them lunch and dinner, and paid them. I heard from the company a little later claiming I didn't pay the whole amount.They asked me to provide proof that i paid.I asked my guy at the time if he could get a copy of the check I used.He gave me a copy of the check, also showing it had been paid.I sent it to the company. Now again in 2010, they're contacting me saying they never received proof and my account is now in collections with interest. How are they now contacting me after almost 4 years? never once did they send me a letter in the mail. Pls help.",

        "If it has been more than four years, most likely the account is unenforceable in court, although they may try to report this on your credit report. The first link, below, are guides by the California Attorney General's Office on movers, which you may want to review. Within California, movers are regulated by the Cal. Public Utilities Commission, and there is a link within the AG's link, below.\n\nI would not offer to pay a dime and you should write a letter to them disputing this bill on the facts that you stated in your posting and anything you find useful on the AG's or PUC's sites. Free sample letters are in my second link, below. I suggest that you use letter 1.1 to the debt collector and if they report the debt on your credit, then send letter 3.1 to the Credit Reporting Agencies. Please always keep copies of your letters and send it by Certified Mail, Return Receipt Requested, because companies routinely throw out mail or deny receiving it.\n\nIf you need further help with illegal harassment, please contact me through my Avvo profile. I have been helping consumers with illegal collections since 1997. Threatening to sue you on a time-barred debt is also illegal harassment.",
        "Yes. Sending an account to collections is not a legal proceeding.",
        "In CA the statute of limitations to sue on a breach of a written contract is 4 years from the date of breach, so if they're within that 4 years, they can send the debt to collections and/or sue you, and there's no requirement that they call you or write you a demand letter first.\n\nBut this claim is bogus, since you paid in full and proved that you did. This company obviously keeps lousy records. Next time you hear from the collection agency, respond in writing that you paid this moving invoice in full, you proved it by sending the company a copy of your check when they asked for it back in 200X, and if they don't stop contacting you, you'll sue them for violation of the CA and federal debt collection laws. Send your letter (and enclose a copy of the check again) by certified mail, return receipt requested, so you can prove their receipt.\n\nDisclaimer: Please note that this answer does not constitute legal advice, and should not be relied on, since each state has different laws, each situation is fact specific, and it is impossible to evaluate a legal problem without a comprehensive consultation and review of all the facts and documents at issue. This answer does not create an attorney-client relationship."

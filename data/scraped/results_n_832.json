    "title": "Unpaid medical bills in California as a tourist.",
    "question": "Last year I ended up at a hospital in the Bay area. I got stitches and a CT-scan. The bill came out to be a little over $47.000 which almost $40.000 of the total is for the hours I spent in the emergency room. I have now, one year later, received several calls from a collector who's calling from Switzerland (I'm guessing the hospital sold the bill to a collector) that wants to settle an agreement but I don't know what to agree to considering I cannot pay this amount of money in a very long time and I did not have an insurance when the accident occurred.",

        "You may be denied admission as a result and yet, you may be served with a legal process to answer for the bill's amount.",
        "I think that there are some serious barriers standing between the hospital and the enforcement of this debt. Some of them could involve the application of Swiss law so you have to take what any US attorney has to say with a grain of salt. Turning to your questions, here are my thoughts:\n\n1) if you don't pay the bill, the hospital can continue to seek voluntary payment using collections agencies. The real question is whether they could enforce the debt as a judgment against your assets (presumably all in Switzerland). Assuming that they filed suit against you in Switzerland, that is a pure question of Swiss law as to what the rights and remedies are. Assuming they file suit in California, they would need to obtain service of process before any judgment could be entered which would require compliance with the Hague Convention assuming you remain in Switzerland, which is an expensive process. Assuming they obtained a judgment in California and sought to enforce that judgment in Switzerland, again a question of Swiss law there as to whether Swiss law recognizes a CA judgment.\n2) No.\n3) The statute of limitations to file a lawsuit for medical debt is probably four years. But they can seek voluntary payment indefinitely.\n4) In theory this would be possible but it is unclear whether it would be in your favor to countersue for this conduct as opposed to using it as a defense to the lawsuit, assuming it was even advisable to defend the suit in the first place because of the jurisdictional problems."

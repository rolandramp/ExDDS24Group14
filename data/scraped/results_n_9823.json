        "Because you are in bankruptcy, the lender is going to likely not want to speak with you unless they have permission from your attorney. Because you are behind on your mortgage in a chapter 7, you are at risk of losing your house, but if they are willing to work with you with getting you current, you might be okay. Typically, when someone is behind on their house, I advise them to file chapter 13 if they want to keep their house."

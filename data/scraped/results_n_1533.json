        "Yes. Bankruptcy has historically been considered an equitable matter, and bankruptcy courts are considered \"courts of equity\" and exercise equitable powers under Section 105 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. The U.S. Courts were created under Article III of the U.S. Constitution to administer justice fairly and impartially, within the jurisdiction established by the Constitution and Congress. The US Bankruptcy Courts are courts created under Article I of the U.S. Constitution, and function as \"units\" of the U.S. District Courts and have subject-matter jurisdiction over bankruptcy cases.",
        "The answers given provide you with how and why the bankruptcy court is given the authority to follow equitable principals. Per numerous Supreme Court decisions, the bankruptcy court is given the power to use equity when the bankruptcy code does not have a provision that the bankruptcy court must follow.\n\nTo answer your question about equity, an action at law is an action generally a suit for money damages such as a tort (personal injury or medical malpractice action) or breach of contract action. Also, criminal proceedings are actions at law. An action in equity seeks a remedy when there is no available remedy at law. For instance, if money damages will resolve the issue. An example of an equitable action is specific performance in a sale of property or a house. In this action, the plaintiff will ask the court to make the owner go through with the purchase because houses or property are unique. Family law issues are normally consider to be equity. For example, custody of a child is normally based upon the best interests of the child."

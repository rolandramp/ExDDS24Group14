        "Here's the problem: In CA, we are a \"no fault\" divorce state and either party is free to divorce their spouse with or without their \"permission\". As such, if your wife wants to be divorced, then she can be divorced. If you do not respond, then she can obtain a default judgment against you and be divorced without your participation. If you do not respond and she obtains a default against you, your rights will be severely effected. You need to file a response.\n\nJust remember, just because you respond does not necessarily mean that there is no hope for reconciliation of the marriage. Contrary to what you may believe, there is at least one divorce attorney (me!) who is supportive of marriage. No matter what the outcome, you will be able to look back and say you did everything you could do in this situation. Hopefully, you two will enroll in some counseling and find out which path your relationship should take! Good luck!",
        "Failure to respond will result in a default entered against you. The judge will create an order, binding both of you - legally enforceable (not following the order could result in penalties and sanctions), based solely on what your spouse has requested/stated. Your voice will not be heard.\n\nTraditionally, the fastest way to divorce is by coming to an agreement on the items in your divorce with your spouse. If the two of you can do this on your own, great! If not, there are many divorce mediators and collaborative divorce attorneys who can help you. Whatever process you choose, you should definitely have an attorney advising you and looking out for your best interests. For more information on consensual dispute resolution processes, you can visit my web site.\n\nThis is not legal advice. This information is general in nature and is not intended to create an attorney client relationship. You should consult an attorney directly to assess your situation and advise you accordingly.",
        "If you do not respond, the Petitioner can file for default and most likely will be awarded every reasonable things requested. If you do respond, you have the option of contesting Petitioner's claims, or negotiating a settlement to present to the court. Either way, the minimum time is 6 months from date Summons was served. In California, fillable form for response (FL 120) is available at http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/forms.cgi",
        "The easiest and most amicable way to get divorced is to agree on everything with your soon-to-be-ex, and each of you spend an hour with your own family lawyer to review your agreement to make sure it's fair to both of you, and have it be uncontested. If you can work out a division of property and debts and there are no custody or support issues to fight over, and your lawyer says it's fair, do it as an uncontested proceeding.\n\nPlease see the guide linked below, written for non-lawyers, and including all the forms required for the process.\n\nDisclaimer: Please note that this answer does not constitute legal advice, and should not be relied on, since each state has different laws, each situation is fact specific, and it is impossible to evaluate a legal problem without a comprehensive consultation and review of all the facts and documents at issue.

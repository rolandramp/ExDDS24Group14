        "Under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), as interpreted by the United States Supreme Court in Patterson v. Shumate, 504 U.S. 753 (1992), all of your income from the pension plan is excluded from the powers of the bankruptcy estate. It is not only excluded, but it is exempt. Your pension cannot be touched by the bankruptcy trustee.",

        "Yes, but first they have to sue you and win a judgment. Garnishing wages is one of the ways of enforcing a judgment.\n\nIt doesn't matter if there was nothing in writing if there was an oral contract to repay the rent payments. If you argue that the rent payments wre a gift, then it will be your word against his, if he claims that it was a loan that you agreed to repay. As for when repayment was due and when you breached, your ex thinks that time has passed, and while a judge won't enforce a contract that's too vague, they will impute a reasonable term if one's missing, and your ex may succeed in persuading the judge that the time to repay the money has come and gone.\n\nDisclaimer: Please note that this answer does not constitute legal advice, and should not be relied on, since each state has different laws, each situation is fact specific, and it is impossible to evaluate a legal problem without a comprehensive consultation and review of all the facts and documents at issue. This answer does not create an attorney-client relationship.",
        "Before anyone can garnish your wages (and, yes, it can be an individual), they have to go to court and get a judgment against you. In this case, he will have to show that his payment of the rent was a loan and that you promised to repay that. This is difficult to do if there is no written document but if there are witnesses who corroborate his version or if you ever said this to anyone else (an admission), he may be able to succeed. But can he get your wages garnished simply by saying he is going to? No.\n\nSorry this happened to you. Breakups are never fun and this kind of fighting and those kind of threats just make it worse. Good luck!\n\nLegal Disclaimer: You should remember that this answer does not constitute legal advice, and should not be relied on.

That is why a lawyer can't evaluate a legal problem without a consultation and a chance to review every fact and document at issue.\n\nAlso, this answer does not create an attorney-client relationship between us."

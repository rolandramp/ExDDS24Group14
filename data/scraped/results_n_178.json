    "question": "My brother had all of his money put with a financial advisor and had beneficiaries for several accounts. Is this considered part of an estate if it is already planned who gets it.? Without the cash value his estate is really nothing that we know about but by the time we will be able to remove contents of apartment another month of rent will be due. Who is to pay for this ? Or other debts?",

    "answers": [
        "It is all considered part of his \"estate\". An estate's gross value is determined by adding up the estimated value of all assets. As to \"who gets it\" that is another matter. Some of the money will go to the already designated beneficiaries. The rest needs to be assessed to whether or not it exceeds the $166,500 minimum to go through a probate proceeding or whether or not it can be passed on to his \"heirs\" via an affidavit of small estate. The estate is responsible for all debts and liabilities.",
        "Probate estate includes all property and interests of decedent which do not pass by beneficiary, joint tenancy,, POD designation."

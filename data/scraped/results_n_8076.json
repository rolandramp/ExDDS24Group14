    "title": "Can I settle with the Collection Agency for my Auto Title with 50% of the original debt?",
    "question": "The car has been charged off. They were unable to repossess the car from me. I believe the loan is with a collection agency that called my parents months ago. Original sale was 23k, put down 10k and was financed for13k. Had 4k left on loan and lost my job. Defaulted on the loan. Credit report shows a 7k charge off and loan transferred.",
    "answers": [
        "A \"charge off\" is an internal accounting method that takes a loan off the books. It doesn't mean that the creditor doesn't still own the loan and won't still try to collect on it, by either repossessing the car or by suing, especially since it's been a year and they have 4 years from the date of breach in which to sue you for the unpaid debt plus accrued interest at whatever rate you agreed to, plus collection costs, assuming you agreed to pay those too.\n\nIf your credit report doesn't disclose who owns the loan now (and is reporting it still unpaid), and if your parents don't know what collection agency called them, you can be reasonably sure they'll call again, they're known for their persistence. They may be motivated to settle, maybe not. They will be motivated if your loan was considered uncollectible and they only paid a small fraction of its value for it. You need to make sure that whoever you try to settle with actually owns the loan and can settle the debt.",
        "If they are willing to settle, yes."

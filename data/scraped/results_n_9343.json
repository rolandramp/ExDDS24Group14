        "I am not licensed in California, but can advise that in Florida, presenting proof of the filing of the bankruptcy will result in the reinstatement of the license.\n\nMy suggestion is that you contact California's DMV before you file the bankruptcy, not after, so that you can learn what THEIR requirements are. You may not want to file the bankruptcy if you can not meet those requirements. However, you may decide based upon your circumstances to file the bankruptcy regardless of the license issue since you are experiencing extreme hardship.\n\nGood luck.",
        "I have filed several cases in California with these facts. (However, if the judgment was for damage caused while driving under the influence, it would not be dischargeable).\n\nHowever, after filing the bankruptcy you will have to take additional steps to contact the DMV to clear the matter up.\n\nI believe there is an organization in Orange County that does assist people in need. Waiving the filing fee depends on various factors, but may be possible.",
        "Generally the automatic stay does not cover getting your driver's license back. By filing bankruptcy, generally the automatic stay will not let you automatically get your DL back.\n\nYou might try to contact your local bar association to seek a pro bono bankruptcy attorney. If you file yourself you can apply for a fee waiver."

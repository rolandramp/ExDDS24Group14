    "question": "The company closed its doors over a year ago and I still have not been paid my wages or PTO and they won't pay this debt. I was a manager and was given permission from my district manager to sign a contract for a phone book add. The contract wanted a principle to sign, however I signed my name with \"manager\" after. I had no ownership in the company. The creditor is trying to garnish my wages and has reported it on my credit report.",

However, you mention that the creditor is attempting to garnish your wages. A wage garnishment can be done only after the court enters a judgment against you. If you are sued, you must respond by filing the proper papers with the court. If your employer has received any garnishment paperwork from the Sheriff, get a copy and get the case number.

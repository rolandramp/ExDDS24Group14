    "title": "After I requested discovery by the Credit Card Collections attorney they sent me discovery forms?",
    "question": "This is nuts..I filed my response to the summons (credit card debt collections) then got a letter from the attorney asking me to make payments on a debt I don't know that I owe yet. I sent out discovery forms and I mean within 3 days I hade discovery forms sent to me! So I am not going to get the information I need before It is time for me to send back my answers to their discovery request. Something is not right here I don't think I have ever had a credit card by Chase and all I am asking for is proof that it is my debt. I suppose I keep saying defendant is without sufficient information until they give me what I am asking for? the way their questions are formed its like they are trying to get me to agree that I owe this money! any suggestions?",

If you did not open this account, then either it is a case of mistaken identity (someone else with the same name) or identity theft, for which you should get a police report for identity theft and follow the steps in my legal guide on Avvo (linked below) on what to do when you learn you are the victim of identity theft. You have numerous legal rights that you may not be asserting, if this was not your credit card. Failure to assert your rights often results in a waiver of such rights. Thus, you should retain experienced counsel right away.\n\nRobert Stempler (see DISCLAIMER, below)\nwww.StopCollectionLawsuits.com",

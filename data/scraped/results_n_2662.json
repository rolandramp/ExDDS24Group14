        "You write a check to make a loan payment, believing it to be good, and it bounces, that's not a crime. In fact, their threats to bring criminal charges is probably illegal. Debt should be dischargeable. You should get a free consultation from a good bankruptcy attorney!\n\nGood luck!\n\nRob",
        "Yes, filing a bankruptcy would (most likely) discharge an installment loan. However, if they are claiming that you committed fraud, further down the line you might be looking at an adversary proceeding to make a determination of dischargeability of that debt. I would recommend that you consult with a bankruptcy attorney as many offer free consultations.",
        "Unless the creditor exchanged some benefit for your NSF check, the likelihood of criminal charges is remote. If you pay a payment on an exisiting loan and that check bounces, there is no criminal charge. If you got a \"payday\" loan and issued post-dated checks and one of them bounced, there might be a different result. More facts needed to give you useful advice.",
        "Yes, you can file bankruptcy and discharge an installment loan, though there are many other factors that go into whether you should file for bankruptcy. I'd advise a consultation with a local attorney as soon as possible - many offer free consultations. I would add that writing bad checks is indeed a crime, and if criminal charges are brought you could run into issues with nondischargeability. It would be a good idea to act quickly to avoid problems for the future. I hope that helps, and best of luck to you."

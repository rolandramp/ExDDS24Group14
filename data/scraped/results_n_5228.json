    "title": "Can I appear in court on behalf of my wife?",
    "question": "She was sued over an outstanding loan debt. The summons is in her name only. They levied our bank accounts. Since I am the sole earner in our household, they levied all of my earnings. We filed a Claim of Exemption and now have a hearing scheduled. My question is, can I attend the hearing by myself (without my wife attending) to argue the case since it is basically my earnings and bank account (joint) that they levied? Do I need her to sign a power of attorney stating I can act on her behalf?",

        "Why will she not be able to appear on her own behalf? However, you should be able to appear as these are your wages being garnished on the basis that this is the debt of your spouse. It will be up to the judge to decide if you have presented enough evidence, but as the spouse and these are your wages, I don't know why a judge would not allow you to appear on your own, though they may ask why your wife was not also present.\n\nThe creditor can go after the spouse's accounts and income to collect a debt of a spouse with an unpaid money judgment. Cal. Code of Civil Procedure, Section 695.020(a), states: \"Community property is subject to enforcement of a money judgment as provided in the Family Code.”\n\nCal. Family Code, Section 910, states: “Except as otherwise expressly provided by statute, the community estate is liable for a debt incurred by either spouse before or during marriage, regardless of which spouse has the management and control of the property and regardless of whether one or both spouses are parties to the debt or to a judgment for the debt.”\n\nPlease read my two links, below to my blogs and legal guides and consider those options. If this lawsuit was not properly served on you, then you can get an attorney to set aside the default judgment, which will stop the wage garnishment, remove the judgment from the court's record, and stop any credit reporting of the default judgment. Please see my \"options\" blog, linked below. It is up to the judge in your case to decide, so you should contact an experienced attorney, who does this paperwork for defendants regularly, to put the odds in your favor or be advised if there is a problem. There are strict time limits on this, so please contact the attorney promptly, to protect your rights.

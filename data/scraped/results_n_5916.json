    "title": "I received 'request for dismissal' from the creditor that never filed a lawsuit against me. Is it one of deb collection tactics?",
    "question": "i have some credit card debts and one of the creditor (through attorney they hired for my case) recently sent me an offer letter to give a discount on my debt.. then after several weeks, sent me 2 identical letters (on the same day) that was tiled, \"request for dismissal\", and look like a court document. I've been served a judgement before so I know what court summon looks like, but this creditor never filed a lawsuit against me. So I don't understand why they're sending me this 'request for dismissal' to me when i didn't even ask them to dismiss it and they've never even tried to file a lawsuit against me. Do I need to respond? Not sure what i'm supposed to do with the documents I have received.",

I would make an appointment with with an attorney experienced in suing creditors for unfair debt collection practices. Using the information on the documents, the attorney should be able to quickly tell if a lawsuit actually filed and whether or not you have claims against the creditor for abusive debt collection practices.\n\nif you have lots of other debt as well, perhaps you should see a bankruptcy attorney as well.",

Collection companies are notorious for violating the law, so there's a reasonable chance they sent you false or inaccurate documents to get you to pay the bill."

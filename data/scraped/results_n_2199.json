    "title": "My dad was in a Chapter 13 bankruptcy and died. Should I keep paying the bill for his case",
    "question": "My dad filed for a Chapter 13 two years ago. I recently found out that he had done so. He has since died three months ago. Right now he is a couple of months behind on his payments to the court and the trustee mailed him a document saying he is late on his payment and that they will dismiss the case.",

        "I concur with my colleagues and add the following: It is important to know why he was in a 13 instead of a 7. If there were issues with him passing the \"means test\" because his income was too high, the case can be converted to a 7 and the creditors will not receive any more payments. If he had too much equity in his assets, his attorney may have recommended a 13 calling for full payment to the creditors. Upon completion of his 13, the assets in the case would belong to his estate and could be divided among the beneficiaries of his will/trust/etc.",
        "So sorry for your loss. I realize you only just found out about the 13, but you might want to look back and see what was going on at the time he filed. There are a number of factors to consider to determine if you should take up the chapter 13 payments for your father including but not limited to why he filed, what his payments were, and what was being accomplished by the chapter 13. For instance, if he filed to save his house from foreclosure, and he owes more on the first mortgage than it is worth, that may weigh in favor of dismissing the case. If it is worth more than the first mortgage, that may weigh in favor of continuing the chapter 13.\nYou really need to look at all the issues with chapter 13 counsel who is also familiar with probate to determine your best options.",
        "Check to see how many years remain on the bankruptcy payment plan before spending any of your own money.",
        "Get in touch with your father's bankruptcy attorney. Besides continuing the chapter 13 bankruptcy, you may have other options such as dismissing the case, converting to chapter 7, or even asking for a hardship discharge (where the court might elect to discharge the decedent's death anyway).\n\nIf your father filed the bankruptcy without the aid of an attorney, contact any of the well qualified attorneys here on AVVO. Sorry for your loss, and good luck.",
        "I am sorry for your loss. You need to consult the attorney that had filed the case, and if there was not one, you need find a BK attorney to assist in the next steps. There are procedures and notices for the death of a debtor, and BK attorney can guide you through that. Check AVVO, NACA or NACBA for a referral in your area."

Are there different forms that need filed or is it pretty much the same petition? I am in the Central District of California.",

        "Yes, there are many differences and things to consider. As many have said, the LLC does not receive a discharge of the debt and does not get to exempt any assets. I also agree that often times that chapter 7 bankruptcy for LLC is a waste if the correct planning is done to wind down the LLC. Remember that the LLC cannot operate in Chapter 7 (unless court approves which is very rare), so the LLC will need to be shut down immediately. Also, filing bankruptcy for the LLC can cause the bankruptcy trustee to seek to avoid and recover certain transfers to creditors or insiders. It is best to consult with an experienced attorney before considering this route.",
        "Besides not getting a discharge, the LLC doesn't get any exemptions either. For personal bankruptcies those are usually the two biggest benefits to filing. An entity will usually have to cease operating immediately.\n\nThere may be reasons for an LLC to pursue Chapter 7 bankruptcy. For example the priority of payments to creditors. However, you want to make sure you have a plan/strategy before the bk is filed. Consult with an experienced attorney before you proceed.",
        "Most of the time, filing BK for an LLC is a waste of time and money. An LLC does not get a discharge. It is better for you to file personally and list all the debts of the LLC for which you are responsible. Remember, BK is not a DIY project.

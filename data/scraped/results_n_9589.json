    "question": "I begin graduate school soon and have qualified for school loans. I may have to go bankrupt, however, and I am afraid that my school loans may seize half way in between school if I go bankrupt.

        "I agree with Mr. Mathias’ answer. Another consideration is to determine whether you will need private student loans to pay for your graduate program after the first year. As you are probably aware, the process to obtain federally backed student loans (Stafford Student Loans) does not involve a credit check. However, if you will be dependent upon private student loans in the second year, you should inquire as to whether a bankruptcy will affect your ability to obtain private loans. While I have never heard of a private student loan lender terminating an approved disbursement, it is quite possible that if you require private loans next year you will incur a higher interest rate or need a co-signor.",
        "I've filed cases for many students receiving loans over the years and have never had a client experience the problem you describe. Sometimes clients have just received a large loan and have the cash on hand when filing, which can complicate the filing, but I've never had any trustee even inquire about future disbursements.\n\nTo be safe you should ask your student loan office about whether bankruptcy might affect future loans and of course discuss the issue with your local attorney as local practice varies."

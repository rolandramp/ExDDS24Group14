    "answers": [
        "I agree with my colleagues. If the overpayment was not the result of fraud or intentional deceit on your behalf then you can likely discharge it in chapter 7 bankruptcy, assuming you qualify to file chapter 7. Make sure to consult a couple experienced bankruptcy attorneys and I highly suggest retaining one to handle your case, it is well worth the attorney fee to make sure everything is done correctly and it takes the stress of of you.",
        "I agree with my colleagues that if the overpayment was an innocent mistake and that you made no factual representations that were false or misleading in order to receive the excess payments, then the debt should be dischargeable. However, if you are also continuing to receive disability payments from the same provider, you may be subject to having the overpayment recouped against future payments. Although this may seem as if the disability provider is violating the automatic stay and eventual discharge of the debt, recoupment of the overpayments against future payments does not violate the stay or the discharge.",
        "You can file, and the insurance company will have an opportunity to object if they contend that the over payment was a result of fraud that you committed. You need a consultation with a lawyer, and you can probably get it for free.\n\nYou should go see a bankruptcy lawyer, or two and discuss your financial situation. Take all the paperwork, and most will provide a free consultation and tell you exactly what you need to know.",
        "Most debts are dischargeable, but not all. The exceptions include, among other things, those incurred by fraud or false financial statements. Assuming the overpayment was not obtained through your false statements or fraud, the debt is probably dischargeable. You should sit down with an experienced bankruptcy attorney to discuss your situation to determine your options and chose the best course to take for you.",
        "As long as there was no fraud or deception on your part in receiving the overpayment, you can most likely discharge this debt if you otherwise qualify for a Chapter 7.\n\nRemember, BK is more than checking boxes on forms you find online.

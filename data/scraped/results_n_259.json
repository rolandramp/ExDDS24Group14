    "question": "I owe $75k in state taxes. My ex and I filed taxes separately in our divorce and our account was flagged. At the time we had multiple rental properties and were asked for all receipts for deductions. During our marriage, my ex had our taxes done and I just signed. I had long moved out of the home and my ex said our basement flooded and all documents were loss. in the end, all rents were charged as income and allowed zero deductions. I can not rebuild with this hanging over my head and the state rep said I was too young for them to accept an offer. I'm 54 next month.",

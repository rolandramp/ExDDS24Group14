        "Yes, you do need to file an Answer to the Complaint. Even if you want to settle this debt, filing an answer and showing that you are prepared to litigate the case will ensure that you will have bargaining power. In most debt-buyer cases, the complaints are not verified, so you can file a General Denial (PLD-050) which is not difficult. You must also get a family member or friend to mail a copy of the Answer to the plaintiff's attorney and fill out a Proof of Service by Mail (POS-030). The General Denial and the Proof of Service by Mail need to be filed with the court, and you will need to pay a first appearance fee ($225 if the complaint seeks less than $10,000).\n\nOnce you have filed your answer, you should consult with a debt collection defense attorney about how to proceed.\n\nGood luck!",

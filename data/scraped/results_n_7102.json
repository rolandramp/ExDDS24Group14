        "This question is more of a family-law question than a debt collection question:\n\nLet me correct your question: \"Is the community estate responsible for premarital debts incurred prior to remarriage?\"\n\nSo that I am clear, you are not referring to spousal support, but rather, debt incurred during the period you were married to wife #1.\" Also, if the court ordered you to be \"responsible\" for the debt, it's most likely because the judge made a legal finding (or you and your previous wife agreed) that the debt--while it was technically incurred by your ex-wife--was incurred during the marital period--hence, it was a \"community debt\".\n\nI recommend you google California Family Code sections 910, 911 and 913 and read them. These family codes reflect, when taken as a whole, that the \"community estate\" IS responsible for the premarital debts of a spouse; however, there are ways to immunize your new wife's earnings and ways for your new wife, should you two divorce in the future, for her to request reimbursement from the community estate.\n\nFinally, I recommend you speak with an attorney because something from your inquiry does not make sense to me, to wit, \". . .make monthly payments to my ex-wife.\" Usually, the payments for prior debts would be made directly to the creditor, not the ex-wife. Discerning this distinction will help you determine the actual (versus perceived) risk that your new wife will be financially exposed to in the future. In other words, is the \"court ordered spouse debt\" for payment of spousal support (which could include arrearages--which are debt--or payment of consumer debt?"

        "The answer to your question is that under the 2005 revisions to the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, you will not receive a dischare unless you take the required financial management class and file a certificate of completion with the court. The procedure is to file a motion to reopen the case, pay the $299 filing fee, file the certificate, and then wait for the discharge.\n\nThis is why we so often suggest that experienced bankruptcy counsel be retained, to deal with procedural issues that come up, and to make sure that there is compliance with all requirements.\n\nBankruptcy requires review of your entire financial situation including all debts, income and assets. I highly recommend that you retain an experienced bankruptcy attorney in your jurisdiction to guide you through the complexities of bankruptcy law and procedure.\n\nI truly wish you the best.

        "Usually failing to file the financial management course does not lead to dismissal. Your case is closed without a discharge which will require you to complete course and file a motion to re-open the case. Yes, you can file again but there are issues involving the automatic stay and it makes no sense money and time wise and credit bureau record wise, etc. since all you need to do is reopen the case to file the certificate. Your motion is very likely to granted and you can get your discharge. It will also cost you less than starting a new case. Not taking a simple course online is going to cost you at least $500 assuming you already have a lawyer representing you. If your case was dismissed rather than just closed without a discharge maybe there was something else wrong and not just your failure to file the certificate of the second course."

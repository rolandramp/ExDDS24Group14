    "title": "How do I remove lien on my bank account from collections agency?",
    "question": "My ex-wife from 10 years ago is still on my account. I left her on because I work in a hazardous profession and I wanted he to have access to it for our children. A collections agency is seeking money from it because she has failed to pay her bills. She hasn't had access to the account for over 10 years. They are seeking $11.5K from the account. What can I do?",

        "You are fortunate that the creditor had not levied the account. That may happen if the creditor obtains a judgment against your ex-wife and follows all the necessary steps to execute the judgment. If that happens it might be impossible to get the funds back. The logical thing to do at this point would be to close the account. There are other ways to provide security for your kids in the event something happens to you.",
        "File a claim of exemption, Cal. Judicial Council Form EJ-160, see link below to the forms, which you can complete for free and press print, then sign it and make extra copies, to file with the Levying Officer (the sheriff's office that delivered the papers to the bank). Boxes 3-6 are the most important in your situation. You should look at the list of exemptions on EJ-155 for ideas. In particular, you may want to put CCP ยง 704.210 in box 5.

        "Your question illustrates exactly why you would want to remove her name from the account and allow her to have access in a manor that did not look like you have co-mingled funds. Your ex-wife may have other issues besides the $11.5K seeking to collect. Depending on other situations, she may need to speak with a bankruptcy attorney. Alternatively you can work with your bank to find out where the lien came from and then get a determination that the funds in the account are not your wife's. Depending on the amount that is in the account this may be necessary to protect the funds. If there is only a few hundred dollars in the account you might want to start doing business out of a different account, this time leave off your ex-wife's name and find another way to give her access.",

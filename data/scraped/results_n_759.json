        "In addition to the answer from the other attorneys, I can't help but wonder whether you have been getting harassed by the debt collectors and creditors. There are powerful federal laws that govern the conduct of debt collectors and creditors, and you could be entitled to recovery if they are violating your rights. Under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (\"TCPA\"), if creditors or debt collectors are calling your cell phone using an automated system (robocalls), and the calls are made without your consent, each call could be worth $500. In addition, creditors and debt collectors are bound to comply with the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (\"FDCPA\"), and they are prohibited from harassing you with excessive calls or aggressive tactics. If the debt collectors are violating the FDCPA when attempting to collect the debts, you might be entitled to up to $1,000. I recommend you contact an experienced consumer protection attorney for advice. Most consumer protection attorneys do not charge for their services.",
        "The statute of limitations for your case is probably 4 years. I suggest you immediately notify the debt collector that you do not owe the debt, but even if you ever did owe the debt, it is beyond the statute. You might want to hire a lawyer to send them a \"lawyer letter\" which usually ends a matter like this. However, the debt, if you did incur it, can remain on your credit report for 7 years.",
        "For a written contract in California, the statute of limitations is four years. However, be careful about the contract terms. There may be a clause in there that makes another state's statute of limitations control. It's very common with contracts for credit cards, personal loans, and other consumer debts.",
        "You should consult with a California consumer protection attorney. I do not know what the California statute of limitations is on a contract but if it is four years, then you may also have a claim under the federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA)."

        "Your credit will not be affected by your husband's decision not to pay his credit cards. Although you may technically be liable for the debts since they are community debts, it is extremely unlikely that the creditors will sue you for your husband's debts while you were living together on the basis that you might be liable because of community property laws. A creditor can only garnish wages when it has a judgment. A judgment requires that you be served with court papers and given an opportunity to have a trial. If you are sued you must seek legal representation to protect yourself from having a judgment entered against you. I seriously doubt that you will be sued for your husband's credit card debt. There is nothing you need to do to protect yourself except not ignoring any lawsuits against you even if the lawsuit has no legal merit.",

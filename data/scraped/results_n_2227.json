    "title": "Judgment Debtors Examination appointment is set and I have made numerous discoveries on defendant.",
    "question": "I have a judgment debtors exam set up on a smalls claims case that I won. I also received the defendants statement of assets and he placed a big fat 0 all the way down except for his wife's income which he cut in half. Since receiving the copy of his statement, I found out he and his wife just bought a brand new car, they have a bank account and that he does have a job. If I bring this information on the exam date and produce them to the judge to prove he is lying, what can the judge order be done? Will he make us set a new exam and simply request he bring the info in or can he allow me to do a levy or...?",
    "answers": [
        "The examination is not done before a judge. The court clerk will send you and the debtor outside, possibly to the hallway, where you can ask questions. There is no court reporter. If the debtor lies, he lies. The examination is not the place to attempt to prove that he is lying.\n\nIf you have information about a new car, you can serve a subpoena and ask that he bring specified documents to court. If you serve a subpoena, be sure to demand that he produce bank account records, credit card statements, etc.\n\nYou do not need to have a judge approve a levy. You need to obtain a Writ of Execution from the court and then take the Writ to the Sheriff with instructions to seize specified property.",
        "Debtor exam questions are made under oath, so if he were lying, he could be in contempt of court, or worse. If you have proof he is lying, stop the examination and ask to see the judge to find him in contempt of court.",
        "Get him to give you is employment information and his bank account information. wife's income is available for levy. In fact, you should hire an attorney who can keep him reminded that he must not commit perjury."

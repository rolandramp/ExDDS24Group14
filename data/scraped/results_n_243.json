        "Your statements are not clear: Did you receive notice in 2014 when his bankruptcy was filed? Or, did you just recently find out that he filed bankruptcy. If the case was chapter 7 - it should be concluded by now and closed so I don't know what you mean about getting in front of other creditors. Was the judgment specifically based on fraud or is that your opinion of what took place? I urge you to contact a local bankruptcy attorney to discuss the specifics of your judgment and status of the bankruptcy case for further advice regarding your options.",
        "You should seek the advice of an attorney to evaluate your case before you take any action. (1) You do not want to violate the automatic stay or any other court orders; (2) If it's past the deadline to file a non-dischargeability action, you will want to know this before you waste time or money pursuing it; (3) Whether or not you have a claim will depend on what cause(s) of action you sued the debtor for. If it was just for breach of contract and not fraud, you may not have a case. All legal matters have deadlines, and if you do not act immediately, you could lose important legal rights. Get to a Certified Bankruptcy Specialist to assist you.",
        "In addition to the above counsel's responses, there is a difference in \"thinking\" its \"fraud\" because he didn't do a good job and didn't return your money versus a judgment established on claims of legally defined fraud and/or within the definition of the bankruptcy code 11 USC 523 that provides for an exception to discharge.",
        "The case number you cite refers to a case filed in 2014. Clarification is needed to give you useful advice.",
        "You will need to hire a bankruptcy litigator to file an objection to discharge based on the contractor's fraud. Note, however, that if you won your judgment in small claims court, the legal fee to vindicate your award in bankruptcy court will likely be greater than your judgment."

        "You would sign and date the settlement and keep a copy for your records, then send it to the attorney. Monitor to ensure that they file dismissal of the case before your trial date, so that they don't pull a fast one and attend trial and get a judgment against you. You should also receive a signed copy, if your copy is not signed by the Plaintiff or its counsel. I have on Avvo three legal guides for settlement paperwork, which you may want to review to see if there is anything important you need to add.",
        "Once you sign a settlement agreement, you are tied into that agreement, even if it is one-sided. Before you sign any sort of agreement, it is prudent to have an attorney look it over.",
        "The smart money is on getting a paid consult. It should be short and simple (on these facts), therefor well wprth the cost.",
        "Before you sign, you should as an attorney to review the document, as well as the relevant circumstances. I do not think that you should sign any legal document if you are unsure about any aspect of the document or of your legal rights. Question: does the agreement mention that you will / will not receive a Form 1099-C, which may require that you pay income tax on the amount that their claim was reduced? What about credit reporting? Are you dealing with a debt buyer or with the original creditor? If you are dealing with a debt buyer, are any warranties included? What recourse do you have is some other collector comes after you for the same debt? Have you pulled your credit reports from each of the 3 major credit reporting agencies? If so, how is this account reported, who reported it and when?"

    "title": "What is bankruptcy authorization letter ?",
    "question": "After we had filed bankruptcy ch13 the bank called us asking for Bankruptcy authorization letter. What is that? We had tried to apply for mod for over 2-3 years now. No results. They send us foreclosure notice on our door, so we filled bankruptcy.",
    "answers": [
        "Banks routinely request authorization letters for debtors who are in active bankruptcies who wish to attempt a loan modification.\n\nThe bank simply wants assurances that they can discuss loan mitigation options with you without fear that they will be sued by you.\n\nIf you are considering loan modification, have your attorney send authorization asap. It will have no effect on the automatic stay or your ability to discharge the debt.\n\nBest Wishes,\n\nSteve Doan, Esq",
        "The bank is requesting an order from the Court allowing you to enter into discussions for a modification agreement with them. In the Central District of California (Los Angeles area) we have a local form for this purpose called \"DEBTOR'S APPLICATION FOR ORDER CONFIRMING THAT LOAN MODIFICATION DISCUSSION WILL NOT VIOLATE STAY\". This is done out of paranoia on the part of the banks that merely discussing this could get them in trouble for violating the automatic stay.\n\nYou should have your attorney file a similar motion (application) in your case to appease your lender.\n\nMark J.

        "Without more information, I would say they could be asking for a letter from your attorney (if any) authorizing the bank to continue loan modification talks with you directly, instead of through your attorney.\n\nAlso, I would recommend you speak with an attorney regarding your Chapter 13 case, if you haven't already. Chapter 13 may or may not be the best solution for you. Chapter 13 cases often fail when people file them without the assistance of an attorney."

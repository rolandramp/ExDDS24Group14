        "If you have lived in CA for 91 days before you file, then you file in CA. You would use a CA licensed attorney.\n\nThe issue is what exemptions do you use. You would not be eligible to use CA exemptions even though you are filing in CA. However, many state's exemptions can only be employed by residents. I don't recall if NV has such a provision, but I bet it doesn. In which case, you would default to federal exemptions.",

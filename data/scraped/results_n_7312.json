        "You may have SEVERAL problems. If your Corporation had Workers' Compensation Insurance, the Carrier is handling the matter. Unless there are allegations of Discrimination (132a) or Serious/Willful Misconduct, you shoulld have no liability.\n\nIf your Corporation did not have WC insurance, the Corporation will offer you no protection. As an Officer, you will be held personally responsible for any Uninsured Employer liability. You will need a Certified Specialist in WC who can assist you with an Uninsured Lawsuit, if that is the reality. I represent Employers in UEF actions, and so do some others. You may contact me or check AVVO for WC Attorneys in LA area for additional choices.\n\nI just had a UEF client with a LLC in my office yesterday, inquiring about potential personal protection from UEF liability though Bankruptcy. The Corporation will be of no use to you in this problem.",
        "There is no point in filing a Chap. 7 bankruptcy petition for your company. First, corporations are not automatically entitled to a discharge, and WC claims are non-dischargable anyway. You need to file a PERSONAL bankruptcy. Why? Because, despite your using a corporation, you PERSONALLY guaranteed the credit card debt. I guarantee that you did - you signed the applications personally guaranteeing payment, so they will simply come after you, personally, for the money. As for the WC debt, it sounds as if you weren't carrying insurance (otherwise, why would you be worried about discharging the debt, your insurance would pay it). You need to consult with a bankruptcy AND a WC/criminal defense attorney immediately.",
        "To answer your questions:\n\n1) Corporations are never entitled to a discharge. Hence, the work comp claim will not be discharged. Your insurance should pick up the claim;\n\n2) When your corporation files, it will receive the benefit of the automatic stay. For the most part, any attempt to collect on a debt of the corporation is stayed.\n\nIn most cases it is not necessary for a corporation to file a Chapter 7 Bankruptcy (see 1 above). I strongly recommend that you consult with a bankruptcy attorney (experienced) near you.\n\nBest Wishes,\n\nSteve Doan, Esq\n888-Doan-Law\nwww.doanlawfirm.com"

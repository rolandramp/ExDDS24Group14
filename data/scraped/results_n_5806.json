        "(1) What you had was a \"top-hat\" deferred compensation plan. The company held your benefit and the assets set aside for your benefit were transferred to a third party trustee who presently holds the funds. You left off an important fact in determining your benefit. Were the funds sets aside in the plan from your wages or were they paid by the employer. Likewise, you have not provided whether you were a very senior executive (e.g., a CFO, CEO or a COO) or a lower level executive (e.g., one of one hundred vice presidents). These two factors influence bankruptcy courts. If you had say a $200K salary and you put $50K in the plan (leaving you with $150K of salary) the courts see the benefit as being paid by money you already earned as opposed to a situation where the employer put $50K in the plan and you still got your $200K salary.\nThe bottom line on your first questions is that it depends on the facts and circumstances. A chapter 11 is better than a Chapter 7 as a Chapter 11 is a debt reorganization as opposed to a liquidation as you have in a Chapter 7. You need to put in a claim as a creditor and if you are not a more senior executive and the contributions were out of your salary, I would encourage you to hire counsel to educate the court as to why you should be entitled to a preference on this benefit. The bankruptcy courts do not give senior executives a break. they see them as the persons who ran the ship onto the reef. Less senior executives tend to be \"employees\" with less control over corporate financial decisions. Likewise, bankruptcy courts are much more inclined to protect lower level executives who paid money out of their salary that they could have received years earlier but wanted to save for retirement, especially where the executive is older and retirement is around the bend.\n(2) I can only surmise that your source was referring to Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code. Section 409A is a section that was adopted after the Enron Scandal to restrict executive's abilities to pull assets out of a fiscally insolvent business. There is a requirement under Code Section 409A that certain highly paid employees cannot take a distribution from a top-hat deferred compensation plan for six months after a distribution event. The application of these rules are very complicated, but, in general, these delay rules apply only to the senior executive types I described in (1) above. If you are not one of the senior executives the rules do not apply to you.",

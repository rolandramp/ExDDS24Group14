        "There is no obligation for you to pay your father's debts. With that said, you should have no fear of going to his home and reviewing his papers and going through his belongings. You may also want to consider having his mail forwarded.\n\nThe reality is if you were estranged, you may not know what he had and there me be enough someone in a bank account or some value to the trailer that will help dispose of his belongings and leave a little over for you to inherit. If not, you can simply inform the owner of the mobile home park and the mortuary that there is nothing to compensate them and make the choice at that time to walk away.\n\nThat said, if you want your father to have a proper burial, your family may want to work with the mortuary to see what can be done. Since he was a vet, there are likely burial benefits that can help with the expense and this is likely one of the reasons they want his social security number.\n\nBy looking into it you are not obligating yourself and you certainly are not financially responsible.",
        "I agree with Attorneys Potter & James. You have no financial responsibility in this matter. If you are the only heir, you may work with the trailer park to access your father's trailer to look for the information you need. If you have siblings, I would strongly urge you to retain counsel before accessing the trailer without the necessary legal authority to do so. Why? Because your siblings may accuse you of taking your father's property. Good luck to you.",
        "I'm sorry for your loss. If you and other family members can visit him home, you can probably find his SSN among his important papers file (i.e. life insurance policies, bank account statements, etc.). If you don't have the funds to clean & dispose, then head over there with a vehicle or two, some trash bags, boxes, etc. You can give his clothing to Goodwill or the Salvation Army. You will want to file a Probate for him with the local Court. See Avvo.Com under Find-A-Lawyer and enter \"Probate\" and \"Camarillo CA\". Good Luck!!"

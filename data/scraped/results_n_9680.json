        "If you are currently unemployed and have this amount of debt my advice is to file bankruptcy to protect yourself. I do not agree with the post above that you should look at debt settlement since realistically it does not appear you have any funds to settle with. Moreover, you have to allow your accounts to go delinquent before settlement will be ripe which will impact your credit. A bankruptcy will stop the lates, eliminate the debt and give you the fresh start you need. Chapter 7 fees generally range around $1500-$3000 depending on the complexity of the case however yours seems very simple and can be done for $999 plus the $299 court filing fee. While I am located in San Diego, I handle bankruptcy cases in Riverside and San Bernardino as well. If you would like more information, please visit my website below and contact me with any additional questions. I offer free consultations by phone and the paperwork and bankruptcy case can be prepared and completed by e-mail, telephone or fax.\n\nLEGAL DISCLAIMER\nMr. Larkin is licensed to practice law in CA and is located in San Diego.

        "I am sprry things look so bleak at the moment, but you do have options.\n\nYou seem to qualify for a chapter 7 bankruptcy (no assets other than a maybe a home and income under $61,000 since you are on unemployment).

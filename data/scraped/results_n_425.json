    "title": "How can I protect wifes equity share in a property if I file bankruptcy?",
    "question": "I am planning on filing bankruptcy chapter 7 and my wife will not be part of my bankruptcy and will not file. We live in a community property state and I would like to know if a Transmutation agreement between husband and wife can be used in chapter 7 and if the courts accept a transmutation agreement when filing chapter 7 to protect my spouses half of the equity in our property that we currently live in. We qualify for the 175,000 homestead exemption however, when we apply this exemption there is still too much equity and we fear losing the property to a forced sale. Can I use the homestead and the transmutation agreement when I file chapter 7, or can it be used in a chapter 11? Thank you",

        "Even if you were to consider filing a chapter 13 (which is a better idea than a 7 whenever you have equity), you really need to find an attorney who is experienced with your local trustees and judges and what the local customs are in this situation.",
        "The short answer is no, you cannot use a transmutation agreement and the homestead exemption to protect equity in real property. If you have equity in excess of the homestead exemption you are entitled to then you should not file chapter 7 if you do not want the trustee to sell the property. You should consider a chapter 13 filing. This might allow you to pay a percentage to your creditors based on the equity in the property. To fully discuss this option I recommend speaking with a couple experienced bankruptcy attorneys to understand your best course of action for your situation.",
        "Transfers of real property in anticipation of a bankruptcy filing can be set aside as actually or constructively fraudulent, especially where there is no consideration for the transfer. Consult an attorney before filing.",
        "I reclassified this as bankruptcy. You should get some more answers that way.\n\nYou will need to consult with a local bankruptcy attorney to review how title is currently held, appropriate homestead and/or other exemptions to use, and how bankruptcy will interact with that.\n\nYou don't want to transfer assets prior to filing a bankruptcy, especially if transferred without an exchange of equivalent value. That can and likely will be set aside as a fraudulent transfer.

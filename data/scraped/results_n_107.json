        "Bear in mind; you need to do a chapter 7 bankruptcy before doing the student loan case. They are separate cases.

        "First off, what type of student loan debt do you have? Federal or private? What is the status and how much is it? What school did you go to? Did you graduate?

Consult with an attorney who specializes in student loans and bankruptcy",

    "question": "I received a Demand for Cure from the chapter 13 Trustee. Do I have 21 days to catch up? Or, is he just asking for payment arrangements. The Demand Letter doesn’t list any deadlines. It just says to pay-up. Thanks",

    "answers": [
        "During the shelter-in-place the trustee is filing Demands for Cure. If you don’t pay, she will file a motion to Dismiss. Then you have 21 days to get current or respond to the motion.",
        "You have 21 days to catch up, but you may be able to make an alternative arrangement with the Trustee if you call the office.\n\nIf your regular income has been interrupted due to Covid-19, and you can produce documentation to support this, chances are the Trustee's office will be very accommodating in making arrangements with you.\n\nFor example, in many Districts, Courts are allowing 13 plans to go longer than 5 years.",
        "If you have an attorney, call him or her. If you don't have the ability to bring the payments current, ask about a payment suspension or excusal. If you have no attorney, you will have to contact the Trustee's office for additional information.",
        "I assume you have a bankruptcy attorney, so ask him/her. If you don't have one, you should. I've never seen a successful Chapter 13 without an attorney."

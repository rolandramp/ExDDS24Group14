    "title": "I received a vacated judgement without prejudice from midland funding llc California. How long do they have to sue me again?",
    "question": "When filing the papers I requested the original contract, proof of payments made, and the contract giving them the debt. They provided nothing, but filed a motion to vacate without prejudice. Is there a statute of limitations on this vacated judgement?",
    "answers": [
        "Have an attorney review the paperwork. I suspect that there is more involved than the Statute of Limitations. I doubt that Midland dismissed the case in order to benefit you.",
        "I agree with Attorney Stempler, not enough facts here.\n\nMidland may have moved to vacate without prejudice because there were issues with the entry of the judgment, or your papers crossed in the mail.\n\nThe issue is not whether they vacated, its whether they dismissed with or without prejudice.\n\nIf its dismissed then its 4 years from the date of default in the loan alleged by Midland. So if the default date was in 2009, a dismissal without prejudice would likely put the nail in the coffin since refiling would happen after the statute of limitations ran.\n\nAll good interesting questions but insufficient facts to go by to answer your question.",
        "Did they vacate a default judgment, then dismiss the entire complaint without prejudice or did they file the lawsuit, then dismiss the entire complaint without prejudice? Without these details, I am not clear on the status of your case and cannot answer. The statute of limitations normally is based on the nature of the debt and the date when the debtor breached the agreement. In the case of a credit card agreement, it would typically be four years from date that the first payment was missed and no further payments received, otherwise it would be from the date of last payment. It could be shorter, such as a credit card that adopts in its agreement a state law that has a three year statute of limitations.

        "The child support arrears, if any, would not be due to the children but to their custodial parent. Even if it was reduced to a judgment and the children inherited it somehow, I do not believe the children would be entitled to collect at this point. If the children believe they have a valid legal claim, let them prove it. Good luck!",
        "You said the wife's estate--did you mean the decedents estate? If so the wife is one heir--his children are also heirs. if there is anything to divide after debts they will get a share, but someone must open a probate and the heirs (kids) would do well to have counsel.",
        "I agree - it is very unlikely that you have a claim to the money based on child support arrears.\nHowever if he had no will you may be due to some money as heirs."

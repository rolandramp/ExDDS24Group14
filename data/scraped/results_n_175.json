    "title": "Can the bankruptcy trustee force me to sell a home that I inherited but is not in my name?",
    "question": "My father unexpectedly passed away last week without a will and we have not started the probate process. My brother and I are the only heirs and although the home is worth approximately $280k, and is paid off, my father owes approximately $67k to creditors/ back taxes. I am in the middle of my bankruptcy case (meeting of the creditors is scheduled for 10/28/20). My question is, can the trustee force the sale of the home or do I have the option of postponing/withdrawing my case while my brother and I go through the probate process?",
    "answers": [
        "First of all, if you are represented by an attorney, you should be asking this question to your attorney.\n\nGenerally speaking, yes it is possible the Trustee can sell the property. However, there are many questions that need to be answered. For instance, is your bankruptcy a Chapter 7 or 13? If you the case is chapter 7, dismissal is very rarely granted. If a chapter 13, you can simply file a motion to dismiss and it will likely be granted.\n\nAre you the only heir? If you are, the Trustee can force the sale and use the proceeds to pay-off your creditors. If there are more than one heir, the Trustee could force you to pay the Trustee the fair market value of the equity you would inherit, to pay off your creditors.",
        "My colleagues have provided excellent information for you. I urge you to meet with an experienced bankruptcy attorney in your area before the Trustee hearing in order to fully analyze your options. My condolences for the loss of your father.",
        "My colleagues have given you very sound advice. Section 541(a)(5)(A) provides that included in the bankruptcy estate is \"Any interest in property that would've been property of the estate of such interest had been an interest of the debtor on the date of the filing of the petition and that the debtor acquires or becomes entitled to acquire within 180 days after such date by bequest, devise, or inheritance\". Unless 180 days had lapsed since you filed the petition at the time of your father's passing, even though the probate estate has not settled, or perhaps has not even been opened, or the interest is passing outside of probate through a trust, your right to your interests attached upon your father's passing.\n\nI agree with my colleagues that dismissing the bankruptcy to avoid the trustee exercising his/her powers to administer the inherited interest by liquidation or sale is unlikely. You might be able to negotiate a settlement with the trustee, since considerable time would potentially pass before he or she would be in a position to exercise any powers, and you would have the option of asserting the wildcard exemption of $30,825 to exclude that amount from the trustee's powers. Most trustees will also allow you to \"buy back\" the interest from the bankruptcy estate over time, often up to a year or more of payments.\n\nAnd if all that fails, you could convert your case to Chapter 13. That would result in the removal of the Chapter 7 trustee from the case, and you would be able to propose a plan of full or even partial repayment of your debts. As long as the monies paid into the plan yielded a dividend to the general unsecured creditors equal to what would have been payable had you stated in Chapter 7, such a plan could be confirmed.",
        "I'm sorry about your father's passing. If he passed within 180 days of you filing your bankruptcy case, unfortunately any inheritance you are entitled to receive becomes property of the bankruptcy Trustee, subject to any exemptions you may have.\n\nDepending on how you allocated your exemptions, you may have up to approximately $30,000 you can protect in your inheritance.\n\nYou can seek to dismiss your case, but it is unlikely to be granted by the court if there are assets available to pay your creditors.\n\nWhat other options you have really depends on how much debt you have, what your income is and so forth. One might be to convert your case to Chapter 13 and do a repayment plan. Your attorney should be able to advise you on all the different options you have.",
        "If you already filed the bankruptcy petition, your portion of the inheritance is included in the bankruptcy estate.\n\nAt the Meeting of Creditors, the trustee will ask if you inherited or expect to inherit anything.\n\nIt's the same situation if you were to postpone the bankruptcy case, and would be true even if your father passed away in the next few months.\n\nI think you should hire an attorney (if you haven't already).",

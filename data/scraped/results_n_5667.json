        "First you should ensure a Chapter 13 is the best chapter for your situation. Central District Chapter 13 trustees are tough and having someone from out of the district is bad enough. Jumping through the hoops to try to get an out of state attorney to represent you is not recommended. They won't know our specific rules nor are they likely to attend your 341 and confirmation hearings which means you will be represented by an appearance attorney.\nHave you asked the FL attorney if she is willing to represent you? This question would be best posed to her to answer and then I would still advise to seek a free consultation from a Chap 13 attorney in your area.",
        "The out of state lawyer would have to be certified to practice pro hake viche. Which means for this matter only. She would have to apply to the court and the court would have to grant the motion. There are several qualified bankruptcy attorneys who are CA licensed who can assist you and work with your current lawyer.",
        "Yes, the out of state attorney can file an application to appear pro hac vice on one case, but must file the detailed application required by L.R. 83-2.3.1 Permission to Appear Pro Hac Vice, must designate local counsel to assist and pay a $325 application fee. It would be much simpler and easier to just use experienced local counsel.",
        "Bankruptcy Court is a Federal Court. An attorney must be licensed in the State of California in order to be admitted to practice in the Federal Districts of California. However, it is possible for an out-of-state attorney to be temporarily \"admitted\" to represent a client in a single case \"pro hac vice\". A motion needs to be filed with the Central District Bankruptcy Court accompanied by an \"invitation\" to do so by another attorney who IS admitted.",
        "As for lawyers not licensed in California, they cannot practice law in California nor represent bankruptcy clients in chapter 13 cases in California; to the best of my knowledge, California does not have reciprocity with any state.\n\nAs already mentioned, even a great lawyer in another jurisdiction may not turn out to be so great when filing a case in a different jurisdiction where local rules (and local-local rules) may vary quite a lot from that lawyer's \"home\" jurisdiction.\n\nBest bet: stick with an experienced, local attorney for cases that require special attention to detail and frequent hand-holding throughout - you'll be glad you did when it's all said and done.\n\nBest of luck!\n\nMichael Salanick, Esq.\n310-590-4575\nmsalanick@salanicklaw.com\nwww.salanicklaw.com",

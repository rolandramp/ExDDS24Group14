    "title": "I need to get Writ's of Execution for two different counties on amonetary family law judgment.",
    "question": "I need to get Writ's of Execution for two different counties in California on a monetary family law judgment. The judgment is not related to Child or Spousal Support. The court clerk stated that I can't get two Writs issued on the same judgment. That does not sound correct, as I have done it before in a different county. The jurisdiction was changed on the divorce case to the county where I now live. Anyone know the answer?",

        "The answer is you can obtain a writ in every county in which the debtor has property.",
        "A judgment creditor may request and receive a separate writ for each county in which a judgment debtor may have property. The reason is that writ of execution is authorization to the levying officer in a particular county (e.g., the Sheriff) to levy on property located in that county. The San Diego County Sheriff cannot, for example, levy on property located in Los Angeles County. Unless I am misunderstanding something, I think that the Clerk was incorrect.",
        "There is not actually a question here. You could get writs in more then one county if there are assets in more then one county, but the situation seem to be you are trying to get a writ for the same judgement from two courts. That you cannot do."

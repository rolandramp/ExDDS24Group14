        "You are a creditor of your bankrupt tenant. In the course of administering the case, the court/trustee sends out certain notices to creditors. The report you received is commonly called a \"no asset\" report and means exactly what it says. You may have also received a notices from the court/trustee informing you of the so-called \"bar date\" which is the last date a creditor can object to the discharge of its debt. If no objections/complaints are filed by that date, your right to proceed thereafter is cut off. You will probably need to consult with a creditor's rights BK attorney and explain the details and circumstances surrounding the debt which was incurred between your tenant and yourself. The atty can help determine if there are any grounds for you to object to the discharge of your debt. As stated in atty Bunce's response, the statute describing non-dischargeable debts is found at 11 USC ยง523 et seq. Good luck to you.",
        "The reasons for objecting are contained in 11 USC section 523. You can find a copy of this law with a simple websearch, but like most federal law, reading it is not so simple. Hope this perspective helps!",
        "No.\nYou would need evidence that the debtor had undisclosed and non-exempt assets which the Trustee should be administering."

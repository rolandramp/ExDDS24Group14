    "title": "Debt said to be cancelled but collection agency still validating debt, and perhaps may attempt to collect.",
    "question": "I called a collection agency and they said that the debt was cancelled. Because it was past the statute of limitations. However, they validated the debt with me afterwards. It said they are reporting my dispute to credit bureaus, if applicable. It seems as if they still want to collect this debt. Is this debt really considered \"cancelled\" also, what are the chances of a 1099 C being issued by the collection agency for medical debt? If you use the insolvency, excuse. To avoid paying taxes on forgiven debt. Can you include debts that are past the statute of limitations? But that you still owe and can be reported to the credit bureaus",
    "answers": [
        "Yes, 1099 may be forthcoming if they debt was cancelled. You would need to speak with a tax professional about the IRC ยง108 exemption. Making a payment can restart the Statute of Limitations.",
        "They may have \"cancelled\" the debt insofar as they have written it off for their own accounting purposes. However, that doesn't mean you don't owe it, and it doesn't mean they (or some subsequent collector) can't try to collect from you. What does stop their right to collect is the passage of the statute of limitation. After the statute of limitations passes, they can only send you letters saying something like \"We can't sue you for this, but pretty please send us some money voluntarily,\" and if it ran for the original creditor, it also ran for any collector they sell it to. Be careful about validating the debt; if you do so in a signed writing, it can restart the statute of limitations (see Cal. Code of Civ. Proc. ยง 360).\n\nAnother thing that can stop their right to collect is if they actually forgive your liability on the debt (as opposed to cancelling it for their own accounting purposes). But if the debt is forgiven, you WILL be issued a 1099-C. However, if you are insolvent at the time of forgiveness (i.e. your debts exceed your assets), you can file a Form 982 & you will not have to pay taxes on the forgiveness income.",
        "Most creditors \"write off\" the debt which doesn't mean it's not still collectible. They do this for accounting purposes. Once the statute of limitations is up they can no longer sue you. When they issue a 1099c can sometimes be confusing but if they issue you a 1099c to actually cancel the debt then the following year is when you would need to qualify as \"insolvent\" for income tax purposes. That is different than if you file a Chapter 7 bankruptcy. You really should talk to a tax expert about your specific situation to get the best advice."

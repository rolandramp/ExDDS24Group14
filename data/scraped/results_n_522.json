        "In general, an ex-spouse will not be liable for any debts held solely in the other spouse's name. There are a few exceptions. Typically, creditors decide not to pursue the ex-spouse post divorce and after a bankruptcy filing. Certain facts and whether the amounts owed (high dollar amount owed) could possibly compel a creditor to pursue your ex-wife, but unlikely.",
        "Your ex-wife will generally not be liable for any debts that are in your name only. Mr. Heston points out an exception to this, however, creditors, especially credit card companies, rarely, if ever, go after an ex-spouse (whose name is not on the contract) after one spouse has filed for BK and after a divorce proceeding.",
        "While generally the name on the statement of account, or the signature on the contract or application is controlling, Fam.C. § 914(a)(2) provides that a spouse is personally liable for debts incurred for “common necessaries of life” by the other spouse after the date of separation … except that if the debt is incurred while they are separated under an agreement, the other spouse is personally liable only if liability for support is stipulated to in the agreement. Common “necessaries of life” encompass more than food or shelter expenses. In a reported case, a creditor who supplied business equipment to one spouse during marriage was able to recover against the other spouse. Although the equipment was not essential to sustain life and did not qualify as a “common necessary of life,” it qualified under Fam.C. § 914(a)(1) on the basis the equipment was considered reasonably necessary to running the debtor spouse's business and ability to earning a living. [Direct Capital Corp. v. Brooks (2017) 14 CA5th 1168, 1172-1177, 222 CR3d 601, 603-608.\n\nYou may want to consider what the debts were incurred for and whether the amounts involved would be enough for the creditor to consider seeking to recover against your ex-wife. Also, if your divorce settlement includes a provision that you agreed to hold her harmless and indemnify her, while you may discharge the debt in your bankruptcy, except in cases filed under Chapter 13, your obligation to indemnify your ex-wife would be a nondischargeable debt. (See 11 U.S.C. § 523(A)(15).)",
        "If the debt was incurred in your name only, then your ex will not be held liable for the debt post divorce, despite any arguments (or even orders) that it was community debt. If you file BK, you will be discharged of your liability on the debts ... they can only go after her if her name was on the contract."

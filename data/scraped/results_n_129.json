        "If your name is on any of his accounts, you would probably be responsible for those accounts. So make sure, with the creditors, that you are not on the accounts. If you are not involved in any of his accounts, you are not directly liable.\n\nAs to community property, assuming that you live in California, all property acquired, and all debts incurred, after the date of physical separation are the separate property of each. See Calif Family Code 910 and related statutes.\n\nThere are some situations in which you might be liable for medical expenses or certain welfare expenses which involve government programs which have specific provisions. Also, even though it has been 15 years, if either of you filed for a contested divorce, he might be able to ask for spousal support (alimony). Asking for, and getting the court to order, are two different things.",
        "Probably none, unless you still own some property with him (e.g. his name is on your bank account) or you are joint on a credit card or other debt with him (highly unlikely), or if you owe him alimony or child support. If any of those three situations apply to you, talk to a bankruptcy lawyer.",
        "When your ex files for BK, his SEPARATE property is liable, as well as any property that you acquired while married and living together (COMMUNITY property). As you are not living together for 15 years, community property might be minimal.\n\nAs an example, if you bought a car or home together, or you both still make payments on it/them, that could be considered community property, and that property might be seized and sold in the BK, depending on the facts.\n\nGOOD LUCK",
        "In order for you to be liable, the creditor must have some connection to you such as you signing on the credit account. Next, the creditor has to file a lawsuit in which you are identified as a defendant. This is unlikely because they may not even know your name. If they don't name you as a defendant, but name your husband only, they may get a judgment against him only. If they try to collect that judgment, they might seek out assets in his name.\nIf your name is also listed, (like on a deed to real estate), a lien against such property will affect you."

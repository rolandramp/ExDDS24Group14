        "Your parents are not liable for your debts.",
        "It is unlikely that in a defamation lawsuit your parents could be found liable. Highly unlikely. It is also unlikely that if you provide a half-way decent defense, that you will lose. Defamation lawsuits are particularly difficult cases to win. Our office does not do this kind of legal defense, but I highly recommend hiring an attorney if you're going to defend on this case.",
        "Your parents should not be responsible for your individual tort of defamation so no worries there. Even though you have few assets now, if the plaintiff gets a judgment against you that judgment could follow you around for a long time until you are able to pay it. And it will be on your credit report most likely and just make life difficult. Better to avoid it now if you can. Best of luck to you."

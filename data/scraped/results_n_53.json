    "title": "Who has the right to plan the burial of my mother the trustee or the trustee/executor?",
    "question": "I handled the funeral arrangements for my mother as DPOA and Executor. I received information from a cemetery on prices for a nitch also. My Mom has since passed. I am now one of the trustees of 2 trustees and executor. Would I be the one who should be in charge to purchase the nitch at thecemetery. I want to continue handling this matter since I started the process. My sister is trying to plan her burial as the trustee but I want to do it as the executor because we don't agree on what needs to be done. So do I have a right to cancel what she has started and go ahead and finish what I started.",

        "You are confused. There can't be a trustee and executor if, as it sounds, you are administrating a trust. As to powers, it all depends on how the trust reads and what it requires. I would need to read the trust first.",
        "Agent with authority grants in POAH has priority over family member of equal consanguinity.\nReview POAH, trust with probate counsel if you cannot work this out with sister.",
        "There may be a legal answer but I recommend you try to reach a practical solution by meeting with the family members to get their input. Good luck and God bless.",
        "Hello,\n\nGenerally the Will has instructions as to the burial. Please check with your Mom's Will to confirm.",
        "Only the agent under a healthcare directive has the legal right above a family member of equal priority. Very sad. Work it out."

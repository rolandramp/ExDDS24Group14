        "A stipulation is just a contract with terms both side must agree on. You can negotiate for most things, it's just whether a party would agree to it. You don't cite enough information on what you're trying to amend in the stipulation (e.g., not allowed by law, or won't be allowed by the judge?), but that is the general process of a stipulation and its terms.",

        "I don't know what you have read, or who wrote it, but I disagree with what you have concluded from your reading. There is no question that you will face an obstacle when you apply for licensure because of the prior theft offense. But this is a problem that can be successfully overcome if you are committed to a nursing career.Make sure that you don't acquire any additional criminal offenses in the years between now and then. Take a look at the statutory factors of rehabilitation and make sure that you have a lot you can show as evidence of rehabilitation. Get a good licensing attorney on board to help you craft a good \"narrative statement\" accounting for the facts and circumstances underlying the theft as the application requires. Know that it is likely to take extra time, effort, and even some expense (legal fees) for you to obtain the license, but you are not automatically or per se shut out.\n\nSTATUTORY REHABILITATION CRITERIA\n\n1. Payment of the fine or penalty imposed for criminal conviction.\n\n2. Stability of family life and fulfillment of parental and familial responsibilities subsequent to the conviction.\n\n3. Completion of, or sustained enrollment in, formal education or vocational training courses for economic self-improvement.\n\n4. Discharge of, or bona fide efforts toward discharging, adjudicated debts or monetary obligations to others. (Especially where financial problems were factors in offense.)\n\n5. Significant or conscientious involvement in community, church or privately-sponsored programs designed to provide social benefits or to ameliorate social problems.\n\n6. New and different social and business relationships from those which existed at the time of the criminal conduct.\n\n7.

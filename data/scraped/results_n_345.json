    "question": "I repaid my debt on Chapter 13 and was discharged. I was told that my student loan did not qualify so I continued paying my loan payment until on day my Navient loan payment was no longer accepted and I was told that I had zero balance.

        "This happens when the student loan servicer views payments as a violation of the automatic stay. My feeling is you were attempting to pay them electronically, and not sending a bill pay or paper check. If they did not file a proof of claim, then they did not get paid anything during your 13 and the interest continued to accrue during the time you were in your 13.\n\nYou have several options. Make acceptable payment arrangements, get into an income based repayment plan, if eligible, or attempt to get the student loan discharged in your bankruptcy.\n\nYou really need to speak with an attorney who is well versed in both Bankruptcy Law and Student Loan Law. You need to do this right away before an Administrative Wage Garnishment is issued."

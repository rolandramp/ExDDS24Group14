        "Are you sure it's \"answer contract\"? If you admit the debt, why don't you just settle this?

        "When you are served with a summons and complaint, a lawsuit against you has commenced. To protect your legal rights, you must serve a formal written answer on the opposing party. The information, which follows, is not legal advice. Each case is unique and if you have any questions, you may wish to contact an attorney in your area for assistance.\n\nA complaint consists of one or more allegations set out in numbered paragraphs stating why you are being sued. A complaint must also specify the relief that is being requested by the Plaintiff from the court. In your answer, you must respond to allegation in each numbered paragraph. Do not skip any of the allegations as this may be taken as an admission on your part. What you should or should not include in your answer must be determined by you alone. If you are not sure how much information to include or how to word your answer, you should see an attorney.\n\nYou must sign the answer in two places. You must sign at the end of your answer and must also give your address and telephone number. The answer must also be verified. This is a separate part at the end of the answer. You must sign the verification in front of a notary public or court clerk.\n\nA copy of your answer must be served on the opposing party. Assuming an attorney represents the creditor, the papers may be faxed, mailed or hand delivered to the attorney's office. Because you are a party to the lawsuit, you are not allowed to serve the papers personally so you must have someone do it for you. Anyone who is not involved in the lawsuit and is over the age of 18 may serve the papers. Whether the papers are hand delivered, mailed or faxed, the person must fill out an affidavit of service and file it with the court as soon as possible.\n\nA copy of your completed, signed and verified answer must be served on the opposing party or his/her attorney within 20 days after you receive the summons and complaint. After the papers are served, you must file the original answer and the affidavit of service with the court and pay a filing fee. Check with the court noted on the complaint for filing fee information.\n\nIf you are not contesting the debt, what do you hope to accomplish in court? You may be able to save the filing fee, as well as attorney fees you may owe to the creditor under the agreement by which you incurred the debt, by contacting the creditor's attorney to negotiate terms of a payment plan."

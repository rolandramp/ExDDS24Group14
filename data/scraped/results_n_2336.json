    "question": "Last year my friend bailed her son out of jail. The agreement was that he would make the monthly payments , He never made 1 payment and now the Bail Bondman office is calling my friend and making threats that they are garnishing her Social Security Disability and her SSI payments. Her son is back in jail and her income is so low that there is nothing left after she pays her living expenses. My question is \" Can the Bail Bondsman garnish SS Disability and SSI payments ? \" Thank you !",

        "Something you need to understand about filing bankruptcy for a sole proprietorship is that it is exactly the same as filing a personal bankruptcy. If your husband files bankruptcy, it doesn't only effect the assets of his business, it effects your marital assets as well (and transferring property is into one or the other's name is a really bad idea, it will only make things worse in a bankruptcy situation). While you would not get a discharge on the debts if you don't jointly file, the bankruptcy will have a negative impact on those debts because your spouse will get a discharge. Additionally, if you have assets that are above and beyond what you can claim exempt, you will lose them in a chapter 7. Your spouse may want to consider a chapter 13 reorganization, since you can make ends meet other than with the business.\n\nYou will need to consult with a local bankruptcy attorney (or your husband will at least), because this is fact specific and I gave you only a general overview of what to consider. How it effects you really depends on your individual circumstances."

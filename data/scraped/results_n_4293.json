        "It sounds to me like the FTB is attempting to collect an old tax debt from you after you obtained a bankruptcy discharge. If that is the case, then you may be able to file a complaint to determine dischargeability in your bankruptcy case. Whether the tax debts are dischargeable depends upon a number of factors, such as the age of the tax years, the date(s) on which the tax liabilities were assessed, and whether you timely filed a return. Please note that if the FTB filed a Notice of State Tax Lien (\"NSTL\") pre-petition and before expiration of the 10 year period for collection, it obtains an additional 10 years to collect the tax debt from you, making the total collection period 20 years, plus any period during which collection was stayed (i.e., during the pendency of your bankruptcy case) or otherwise extended. You should also be aware that tax liens pass through bankruptcy unaffected, so that if you owned real or personal property on the date that you filed bankruptcy, and the FTB filed a pre-petition NSTL, such lien would continue to attach to your pre-petition property, to the extent of its value.\n\nI hope that this answer is responsive to your question.",
        "The answer to your question depends on many facts including when you filed the return related to the taxes the state wants to collect, when a deficiency was assessed, and potentially if you recently made payments related to this particular tax bill. If you owed the tax you likely cannot use the state for trying to collect it. However, If beyond the state of limitations in your state you might be able to avoid having to pay the claim.",
        "Sue them for what? If the tax is legally collectable, then no. On what basis would you sue over a legally collectable claim? Now, if the tax is not legally collectable (e.g beyond statute of limitations), then you might have options. State agencies do make mistakes. I don't know CA process specifically, but once you have exhausted administrative appeal options (if available), then you can usually go to court for declaratory relief (meaning, get a judgment that you don't owe the debt)."

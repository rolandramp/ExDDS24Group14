        "I agree with my colleagues and urge you to consult with a bankruptcy attorney to evaluate the options for you, making sure you can provide evidence of your domicile in California if that proves to be the best filing option for you.",
        "You can do a 7 in either CA or AL. The problem is what state's exemptions are controlling. Talk with an AL BK lawyer to get the best answer.",
        "Yes if domicile there. However, the petition asks where you have \"lived\" so some attorneys could arguably use ALABAMA possibly too. But asking that means you have NOT met with an experienced bankruptcy attorney and I urge you to do so as other issues can gravely affect your case and will point some of those out for you.\n\nYou need and want to enjoy your fresh start also. But the most important thing is to meet with an\nattorney as you asking this question means you have not. You care about 2 goals: keeping\neverything you have equity in and discharging all your debts. If you don't have any of the\nexceptions to discharge you will obtain that goal; most exceptions are set forth in 11 USC. 523\n(Google it) like child support, some income taxes, traffic (in a ch 7) and criminal fines , and\npresumption of student loans.

        "You need a bankruptcy litigation attorney. These won't be your run-of-the-mill bankruptcy filing attorneys. You need to get with a business/corporate law firm with a bankruptcy department.\n\nSecond, no one is going to make your case for you. Even if the DOJ gets involved, that doesn't help you. You can't force the DOJ or the U.S. Trustee's office to do anything. You need to fight your own fight.",
        "You need a bankruptcy litigation attorney to review the case to determine who filed bankruptcy and whether the time limit for filing an objection has passed. You also need a securities lawyer to determine if any of the state or federal security laws were violated.",
        "1st..a bankruptcy attorney.\n\n2nd. we do NOT know if an individual filed bankruptcy or a corporation. Why do we care? Because a corporation does NOT discharge debts in a ch 7 and cannot file a ch 13 and you dont reference any ch 11 type case. Thus, if a corporation filed, you would be able to still go after the corporation after bankruptcy is closed, and can go after any other defendant who participated in that fraud too. But if an individual filed, it might be better to sue them individually if facts exist to do so under 11 USC 523 subsections as that way only your debt may exist if proven or settled rather than all debts if a discharge is denied to all! The best thing is for you to go see an experienced bankruptcy attorney in the location of where the bankruptcy was filed and soon as we do not know what the deadline date in para 9 is as an adversary must be filed by said date. Good luck.",
        "You need to talk to a bankruptcy attorney who handles creditor cases. If you don't have any luck challenging the bankruptcy discharge you are likely to be out of luck when it comes to any subsequent civil lawsuit.\n\nI don't know what you mean when you say that the bankruptcy paperwork 'doesn't add up' but you may need to object to entry of the discharge or to file an adversary compliant if you believe you can show that your debt constitutes money obtained by false pretenses, a false representation, or actual fraud.\n\nIf you have any evidence of bankruptcy fraud, provide it to the U.S. Trustee's office. However, if you don't have the evidence you are likely to be disappointed expecting any government agency to move heaven and earth to find some for you.",

    "title": "Can a California wife get a financial restraining order? Can she protect herself from hubby's compulsive gambling on stocks?",
    "question": "My retired friend has had repeated financial problems due to her husband's compulsive gambling on the stock market. He admits to having a problem and promises to stop. But eventually he starts day trading again, using credit cards. My friend had to take a second mortgage to pay his debts a few years ago. Things seemed OK, but recently he relapsed and lost alot \"short selling\" stocks, using credit cards to pay the losses. He hid the details from her. My friend had to take another mortgage to pay these losses. She's afraid she will lose her house and wind up destitute when he relapses again. How can she protect herself from his losses? Is there a financial restraining order? Short of divorce, how can she stop him from ruining her? She's very competent and can follow instructions.",

        "A marriage is a legal partnership. When you have a good partner, both parties benefit. When you have an irresponsible partner, both parties may suffer. The only way your freind can protect herself is by severing this legal partnership by filing for legal separation or divorce. While there may be some argument that her husband is misappropriating community funds without her consent, that does not appear to be the case, because she has repeatedely paid off his debts, which lends support to an argument that he would make that she supported his online investments while he was making money, but cried foul play when he lost.\nThere is no \"financial restraining order.\" However, filing for divorce or separation may limit her exposure to his debts. But until separation or divorce is filed, there are not separate debts, only thier community debts.",
        "He is not committing a crime and a regular court will not do anything. If she does not file for separation she will continue to be liable. She should cut up all his credit cards, cancel his brokerage accounts and have him go into a gamblers anonymous program.\n\nThe response given is not intended to create, nor does it create an ongoing duty to respond to questions.

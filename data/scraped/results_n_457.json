    "question": "Signed a contract with this home flipping company to buy and flip this one home. After a year, this company filed chapter 11 and listed me as one of the unsecured creditors. With the valid contract, can I dispute that and file a proof of claim. Can I also sue for breach of contract since my capital didnâ€™t tie to the property as it should?",

        "You must monitor the chapter 11 carefully and be sure to read all documents you receive regarding the case. There will be a deadline set for filing a proof of claim, which you must do timely. I urge you to contact a bankruptcy attorney familiar with chapter 11 cases in order to fully understand your legal options and how the case will proceed. As a result of the bankruptcy filing, an injunction is in effect called an automatic stay which stops all collection efforts by creditors and stops continuation of lawsuits or filing one after the bankruptcy was filed. Seek legal assistance."

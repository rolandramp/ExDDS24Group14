    "question": "I am the judgment creditor and live in another state from the debtor. I have an upcoming judgment debtor examination in the debtor's state and would like to know, can an attorney stand in my place to conduct this exam? If so, what would be the average cost of this service?",
    "answers": [
        "You can shop around but the cost I would say could be anywhere from $150 or $200 to $350 or 400.",
        "Yes. An attorney can appear on your behalf. The cost may depend upon the location of the court. There are \"appearance attorneys\" who, for less than $100, appear on behalf of other attorneys at status conferences and other short proceedings. Such an attorney could conduct a debtor's examination.",
        "Yes. There are many of us on this site who could do that for you. However, in which state does the debtor reside?"

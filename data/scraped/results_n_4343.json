    "title": "What are the rules for amounts that California Department of Child Support Services can levy from my bank account.",
    "question": "I'm worried that if I have my check direct deposited that DCSS will levy my bank account and I will not have access to funds I need for living expenses. I currently have a support order in place which is enforced through wage assignment. I have arrearages that are also being payed through wage assignment. Are there guidelines/rules that DCSS must follow regarding the minimum amount one can have in their bank account before they levy it? For example if I keep the balance at $500 and under will that keep it from being levied?",

        "I agree that there is no safe harbor so you should continue to keep little in the account. However, as a practicle matter, once the wage levy is in place, the department usually goes to sleep until you miss a payment, etc.",
        "The state-wide computer system used by the DCSS, known as CSE, will as part of its function perform a Financial Institution Data Match [FIDM] whereby it checks for accounts you may hold with various different forms of financial institutions [all of whom are required to disclose this information] If/when the system locates the same it will automatically issue an administrative levy to the financial institution to collect your past due support obligation. CSE issues 2 types of administrative levy's, one is know as an \"exempt\" levy wherein the first $3500 in the account is exempt from the levy and any funds in excess of this are seized in accordance with the levy. The second levy is for all the funds that are on hold with the institution. Whether or not you are subject to a straight levy or an exempt levy depends on if you are \"in compliance\" with the terms of the orders that exist against you. Generally, in compliance means that your have meet in full all of your support orders [current and arrears ] over the term of the last 12 months. These levies are issued AUTOMATICALLY and without the need for any initiation or intervention by a DCSS staff worker. As has been noted, you can file a claim of exemption to either of these types of levies. DCSS has the right to request a hearing in regard to your claim of exemption so that the Court can make a determination if some or all of the funds that have been seized by the levy should be returned or applied to your past due support obligation.",
        "There are guidelines and rules, but there is no minimum amount that you can keep you balance to keep it from being levied. Gaming the system can be dangerous as well.\n\nHowever, you need to think of this in practical terms. Does DCSS have the resources to levy these accounts? Usually not. So if you keep current on all your payments, they probably won't go after you."

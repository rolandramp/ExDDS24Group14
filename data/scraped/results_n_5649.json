    "title": "Can a current PhD student get bankruptcy relief from PRIVATE student loans and credit card debt while in school?",
    "question": "I want to keep pursuing my PhD (for another 5 years), but my private student loans won't let me defer, making me get deeper and deeper in debt as my fellowship and employment aren't enough to make ends meet. I pay all of my bills on time. I have a minimal cell phone and internet plan (which I need for school and work), but no cable or unnecessary services). I am happy to keep my federal loans and repay them after I graduate. Can I file for bankruptcy?",
    "answers": [
        "Virtually all student loans, public and private, are nondischargeable absent cases of hardship (which, based on your post is not in play).",
        "I agree with all of the previous answers, especially regarding the student loans being nearly impossible to discharge, but would just like to point out that there may be some additional options you can pursue. First, take a look at this website: http://www.consumerfinance.gov/students/repay/\nIt is a federal government site that is a good starting point and contains some excellent information on the various options that may be available as far as deferrment and other re-payment relief for various student loans, federal and private. Another possibility is to look into a consolidation loan, where you might be able to essentially re-finance the private loans you are having the problem with, with a different loan that might have more flexible re-payment options. Hope this helps.",
        "The first answer by Lisa Jane Espada is very good one. You could get rid of your credit card debt through bankruptcy, but not your student loan debt (federal or private).",
        "It is very unlikely that you will be able to discharge your student loans in a chapter 7 case, even if they are private student loans. The Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Reform Act of 2005 made private student loans non-dischargeable. (This was the work of the student loan industry, which is contributing to the current student loan \"bubble.\")\n\nIn order to discharge a student loan of any kind, you must meet the \"undue hardship\" test, which is a hard standard to meet, and would be expensive to attempt. Basically, you have to prove that you have reached the maximum income level that you are capable of achieving, and you cannot afford to pay your basic living expenses if you also have to make the student loan payments. Usually you can only establish this if you have been in the workforce for some time, and unable to use your education to earn a decent living. You won't be able to claim \"undue hardship\" for purposes of continuing your education.\n\nSorry to be the bearer of bad news. Our student loan system is seriously flawed.",
        "Sure, but I highly doubt that your \"private\" loans are actually \"private.\" First, nearly all SL's are guaranteed by the government. So, if you default on them and the government pays out on the guarantee, it's actually a \"federal\" student loan, meaning non-dischargable. You need to very carefully look into that fact. Second, you may very well find that, assuming you're successful in eliminating your \"private\" loans, you will not be given loans going forward (which you state is for another 5 years). I'm curious why, if you are a full-time student, you cannot defer your repayment obligations? And, you're not eligible for an IBR?"

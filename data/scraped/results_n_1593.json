    "title": "How do I reply to this letter from Mandarich Law Group LLP?",
    "question": "I received a letter from Mandarich Law Group on Aug 30 (dated Aug 28 2015) They are trying to collect a debt from CACH LLC for a VERY old MBNA card that I opened when I was a Freshman in college. I was a struggling college student and defaulted on this back in 2003, I am in California and I know I am WAY beyond the statute of limitations on this debt. How should I reply to them since they said I have 30 days to reply?",

        "Assuming you received a letter, not a lawsuit, as stated by other counsel, challenge the debt. More than likely they will go away. If they do file suit, or that 30 day letter is a summons and complaint, file an answer and assert the statue of limitations. You may be entitled to damages if they knew the debt was too old, and filed the suit anyway.",
        "I agree. Demand verification in writing. You can also ask them to stop contacting you by giving them a cease and desist notice. If they file a lawsuit I would consult an attorney.\n\nYou might also have a claim if they threatened to sue you on the old debt. Again, I would consult a consumer attorney in your area who offers free consultations.\n\nPlease note: I'm licensed in California. This response is intended only as general commentary not legal advice and does not create an attorney client relationship.",
        "Deny the debt, ask for validation and the date of last activity. It is way time barred. they cannot sue you and if they do you will make money probably. Some thought is to totally ignore it and not even bring it up.",
        "CACH LLC is one of the debt buyers that try to collect debts for creditors. Some of these companies are simply bottom feeders that trawl looking for victims like a parasite. The law group is simply acting for CACH trying to collect. Respond to them by demanding VERIFICATION of the debt and asking for any proof that CACH LLC owns the debt now. If you are sued, retain a lawyer who can countersue if the debt is too old to collect."

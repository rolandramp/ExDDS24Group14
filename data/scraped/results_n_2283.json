    "title": "Can I obtain my husband's credit report?",
    "question": "We are going through a divorce. And I need my husband's credit report. Is it legal for me to obtain it from annualcredit report or through a credit reseller? I just called Equifax, their rep said it is completely ok. But somehow I doubt it.. Another problem is that we have recently gotten the judgement (December). So we are not married anymore, but are still going through property division. He owes lots of spousal support money to me.",

        "You cannot get his credit report without his permission unless you do through formal discovery procedures or subpoena. If you get it by pretending to be him, what will you get? A print out containing hearsay information. IF you get the report, exactly how do you propose to get the document into evidence? And for what purpose?",
        "Without his permission, generally the answer is no. You need written permission and his social security number along with a permissible purpose. Otherwise, you could open yourself up to a claim by him for violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act. If you can't get his permission, you can ask the divorce court for an order to allow you to obtain his report. If the court orders it, you can get it. If you need it to decide property/debt division, you should be able to obtain it through discovery. Hopefully you have an attorney to help you with this process. Take a look below at the Fair Credit Reporting Act if you need further information.",

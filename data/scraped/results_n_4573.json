    "title": "What is considered Adequate proof for validation of debt from collection agency?",
    "question": "I sent for validation of a debt and received a disclosure statement from original promissory note. Is this enough or can I request the actual note with signatures? If this went to court would CA have to provide that? CA didn't provide amount currently owed, statements or any breakdown on accrued interest and Charges to \"charged off\" account - can I also ask for this before making payment arrangements or is this not required legally?",
    "answers": [
        "Consult with a bankruptcy or debt settlement attorney. If you recognize the debt as yours, these validation letters merely speed bumps and nothing more.",
        "Validation is a fairly low bar. Most courts simply say that validation requires only that the CA give you the name and address of the original creditor and the amount currently due (note, you might have already received that information from this CA).\n\nPeople confuse validation with what may be required in court for a lawsuit. The CA doesn't need to \"prove\" you, via the validation process, that you owe the debt. They just need to give you enough information so you can decide whether to dispute the debt.\n\nOutside of court, they don't have to produce the note, they don't have to produce statements, they don't have to produce an accounting. For better or worse, the FDCPA is really only designed to prevent egregious collection abuse. The law assumes that if you (the debtor) are told the name of the original creditor and the amount owed, you will either recognize or not recognize it. If you recognize it, the FDCPA assumes you either pay it, or file bankruptcy. If you don't recognize it, then you dispute it and wait for a lawsuit."

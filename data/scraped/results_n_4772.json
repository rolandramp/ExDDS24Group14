        "You are not entitled to have a bankruptcy removed early from your credit report. However there may be methods to attack the validity of information contained in your credit report. If the credit reporting agency does not properly and timely responded to a valid attack, you may then be entitled to have the incorrect information removed. You should not \"bank on\" getting accurate information removed. However, in the event that you have your bankruptcy removed early from your credit report, it will always be on record with the federal government. So, for example, just because you get your bankruptcy removed from your credit report 5 years after filing a chapter 7 bankruptcy petition doesn't mean you would be eligible for filing a second chapter 7 petition sooner than the 8 year waiting period.",

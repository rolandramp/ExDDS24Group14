        "Do do not say whether you have had the assistance of counsel in any of this - speak with a lawyer directly about your case and do it quickly. There is a lot we need to know that we can't tell from your question.\n\nWe need to know the basis of the J-1 requirement to which you are subject (government funding? Skills list?), and the basis on which you applied for a waiver (no objection letter? Hardship?) We also don't know the basis of the I-485 or your current status.\n\nIf you are going to file a Motion to reopen/Appeal, you do not have four more weeks in which to do it - you only have 30, or at most 33, days from the denial date. I'm not clear that an appeal/motion to reopen would help, since if you are subject to the requirement at the time of the decision you would be required to leave and the case was rightly denied at the time.\n\nYou would just have to file a new case after a waiver would be granted - IF a waiver is granted. IT is not completely up you your home country government to require or not require your return - the home country's lack of objection doesn't guarantee a waiver in all cases.\n\nI can't tell you whether you should leave right away without knowing more about your status, any unlawful presence time spent here, etc.\n\nSpeak with a lawyer for more detailed and case-specific advice."

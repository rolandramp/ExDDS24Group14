    "title": "Ways to protect real estate from creditors?",
    "question": "My parents are embedded in large amount of debt that's around $300K. They can no longer meet the minimum payments on their cards and looks like they will default. They have home that's bought for $400,000, which now is worth $500,000, but they only have $70,000 payment left to pay off the mortgage. That's the only home they've got and I am willing to give them around $50,000 to reduce their mortgage. My question is whether it's possible for them to protect their only asset from creditors? I heard of \"equity stripping\" but not sure what it is ad whether it can be applied to their situation. Another way is for them to transfer the house to my name, but I heard that there is such a thing called \"fraudulent transfer law.\" Both parents are retired and don't have much money. What is the best",

        "If your parents have $430k in equity and owe $300k in debt, then there is not much room to maneuver here. What type of debt is the $300k? Did you include the $70k from the first mortgage?\n\nMr. Chen is correct in his analysis of California's homestead exemption. The problem here, however, is that your parents appear to have too much equity in their home to protect it.\n\nEquity stripping involves borrowing against the home to reduce the equity amount. If your parents are older than 65 years old, then they could borrow $255k ($430k-$175k). This would take them to the maximum allowable amount. They could take the $255k to pay off part of the $300k that they owe, and then discharge the rest in bankruptcy. Depending on the nature of the debt, they might be able to negotiation payment of the balance at discount.\n\nNote that they cannot simply transfer any of their assets to you because doing so would be a fraudulent transfer.\n\nThey should consult a bankruptcy attorney for more information as to their options.",
        "Your parents can probably exempt $175,000 in equity in their home, but I am making a number of assumptions which should be discussed with a bankruptcy lawyer. If one of your parents is over 62, they could put a reverse mortgage on the house and use the funds gained thereby to negotiate with the creditors. They really need to talk to a financial planner and a bankruptcy lawyer to figure out the best option. There is a four year look back on fraudulent transfers so I think transferring the property to you is not a good option.",

        "With respect to their house (which I assume is their primary residence), they might not have to do anything. People who usually need the protection of a homestead are either judgment debtors who are claiming an exemption to prevent their home from being sold in an execution sale to pay off a judgment, or are filing for bankruptcy. The amount of a homestead exemption is determined by California Code of Civil Procedure section 704.730, and can be either $75,000, $100,000 (if the judgment debtor or spouse of the judgment debtor who resides in the homestead is at the time of the attempted sale of the homestead a member of a family unit, and there is at least one member of the family unit who owns no interest in the homestead or whose only interest in the homestead is a community property interest with the judgment debtor), or $175,000 (if the judgment debtor or spouse of the judgment debtor who resides in the homestead is at the time of the attempted sale of the homestead either 65 years of age or older, or is physically or mentally disabled).\n\nFirst, a declaration of homestead may be recorded. (Code Civ. Proc., ยง 704.920.) A recorded homestead protects the property from execution by certain creditors to the extent of the amount of the homestead exemption. A \"declared homestead\" is defined as that dwelling described in a homestead declaration. (Code Civ. Proc., ยง 704.910). Code of Civil Procedure section 704.960 (a) provides that if a declared homestead is voluntarily sold, the proceeds of sale are exempt in the amount provided by Section 704.730 for a period of six months after the date of sale.\n\nSecondly, because many California judgment debtors failed to (or simply did not know that they had to) record a declaration of homestead exemption, the California State Legislature in 1974 created an \"automatic\" homestead exemption. (Code of Civil Procedure ยง 704.720.) This automatic homestead exemption need not be memorialized in a recorded homestead declaration in order to be effective. (However, as discussed below, the automatic exemption only provides protection from a forced execution sale).\n\nThe two exemptions are distinct protections and operate differently. The declared homestead provides greater rights than the automatic homestead. The declared homestead provides protection from a voluntary sale. Judgment liens only attach to the equity in excess of consensual liens and the protections of the declared homestead survive the death of the homestead owner. The proceeds from a voluntary sale may be reinvested within six months, thus allowing the debtor to invest in another residence. In comparison, the automatic homestead only entitles the debtor to protection from a forced execution sale.\n\nCalifornia Code of Civil Procedure section 704.960 (a) provides that if a declared homestead is voluntarily sold, the proceeds of sale are exempt in the amount provided by Section 704.730 for a period of six months after the date of sale. California Code of Civil Procedure section 704.960 (b) provides that if the proceeds of a declared homestead are invested in a new dwelling within six months after the date of a voluntary sale or within six months after proceeds of an execution sale or of insurance or other indemnification for damage or destruction are received, the new dwelling may be selected as a declared homestead by recording a homestead declaration within the applicable six-month period. In such case, the homestead declaration has the same effect as if it had been recorded at the time the prior homestead declaration was recorded. Finally, note that you cannot homestead nor do you have an \"automatic\" homestead exemption in a house that is not your primary residence."

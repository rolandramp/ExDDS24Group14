    "title": "When can I file an adversary proceeding regarding a student loan?",
    "question": "Is there a deadline after filing for ch. 7 to file an adversary proceeding? I filed more than 30 days ago and had my meeting and just waiting for the 60 days to receive a discharge. My student loan (by the way, it's just 3,000) lender just informed me that they will not discharge my debt.",

        "Let me pile on to the prior answers of my colleagues: getting a student loan discharged is not just, not just difficult, not just very hard, not just complicated--it is almost impossible unless your circumstances are EXTREMELY dire. Even if you were disabled, that is not in and of itself a basis to discharge a student loan. Even if you were elderly, that is not in and of itself a basis to discharge a student loan. Even if you were disabled, elderly and unemployed, that is not in and of itself a basis to discharge a student loan.\n\nMy observation is that $3,000 in student loan debt is not a lot of money in the grand scheme of life. If you are elderly, unemployable, without a possibility of earning money with which to pay the student loan, then there is a chance.\n\nBut, I am not a judge and I am not G*d, so it is not for me to say with 100% certainty what will happen. But, the point is, the likelihood of success is very, very slim.\n\nAlso, your question regarding service of the summons shows a great deal of intelligence, in that you understand that entities other than the lender must be served with the adversary complaint. By the same token, that technical question is the tip of the iceberg. Are you truly prepared to litigate the adversary? Comply with Rule 26 disclosure requirements? Prepare the necessary disclose statements? Prepare the testimony declarations?\n\nI am not trying to impress you with my knowledge. After all, Rule 26 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure is available on line. But having done several adversaries over the years, I know that there are procedural requirements that must be followed to a \"T\".\n\nGood luck to you in your decision making process.",

        "Holy cats! You are ambitious. The procedure for filing an adversary proceeding in Bankruptcy Court is complicated.

But here's my advice, anyway.\n\nThe first thing you need is grounds for your complaint. Do you have some kind of hardship? (I'm thinking that you are not a quadraplegic.) \"Undue Hardship\" is the standard. Did the school cheat you? Did you not get the education you were promised? Was the school unlicensed?

Instead, make a deal to pay off your student loans.\n\nIf you think you really have evidence to show why the Court should make the loan dischargeable, go to an attorney and ask for their opinion. That much you could get for free, maybe. Also ask what they would charge to file the adversary action. Do not try this yourself. It would be like trying to do brain surgery on yourself.\n\nBy the way, you appear to have filed your bankruptcy petition by yourself. I congratulate you.

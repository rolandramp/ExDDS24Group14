    "title": "Can bankruptcy save you from paying winning party's attorney fees (non debt case)?",
    "question": "This has nothing to do with debt & I am not a creditor or a business. I am the ex girlfriend of the defendant & he was ordered to pay my attorney fees because I showed sufficient evidence that he caused damages to me that caused me to lose money & I had to get a lawyer to fix all this. If he files for bankruptcy can he get away with not paying anything?",
    "answers": [
        "Yes, unfortunately if the lawsuit began before he filed bankruptcy then any attorney fees he was ordered to pay as a result of the lawsuit are able to be eliminated in bankruptcy. Did he file a chapter 7 bankruptcy? You will want to make sure the trustee does not liquidate any of his assets because then you might be entitled to some of the proceeds. If he filed a chapter 13, you will want to file a proof of claim in his chapter 13 in case his chapter 13 plan calls for a percentage to be paid out to his unsecured creditors.",
        "Yes unless the debt is for one of the so-called bankruptcy \"crimes\" listed in section 523.",
        "Yes, costs and attorney fees awarded in litigation which commenced before the bankruptcy petition is filed are normally dischargeable."

        "The creditor will stop garnishing your wages as soon as your son (or someone) pays off the debt. If your son can't pay it off all at once, the garnishment will continue until the judgment is satisfied, but if he pays off some of it, the creditor doesn't need to garnish as much.\n\nMake sure the creditor files a satisfaction of judgment once it's completely paid off.\n\nDisclaimer: Please note that this answer does not constitute legal advice, and should not be relied on, since each state has different laws, each situation is fact specific, and it is impossible to evaluate a legal problem without a comprehensive consultation and review of all the facts and documents at issue.

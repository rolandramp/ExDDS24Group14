        "The question is whether you can file in your chapter 13 or 7 BK on the IRS.\n\nThe answer will always be YES.

In simple language, unless secured, income taxes are not excepted from discharge, and consequently are dischargeable if:\n\n1. A return has been filed;\n2.

        "There are a set of criteria that needs to be met in order for a particular tax to be discharged in bankruptcy, such as whether three years have passed since the tax became due? have two years passed since you filed them? Have 240 days passed since they have been assessed? These, especially the last question, is not a simple yes or no question. This requires an experienced bankruptcy attorney to review your tax transcripts to see if there have been any assessments, whether the assessments have been tolled at all for any given time, and what other issues your particular taxes are facing. The difference between 'winging' this and going to an experienced bankruptcy attorney could be as simple as filing too early and not being able to discharge your tax debt.",

        "If you’re living on SSI, instead of chapter 13 relief you may want to consider filing chapter 7 bankruptcy. Oftentimes options to retain a vehicle can be accomplished in a chapter 7 bankruptcy case, even if you have an outstanding balance due. Accomplishing this can be slightly tricky with a default on your secured debt automobile when filing bankruptcy. However, chapter 13 may not be the only option for you to explore to catch up on past vehicle payments - in fact, much better options may exist for you if low income but still with an ability to pay your car note.\n\nBe sure to work with experienced legal counsel to help you prepare your case correctly and to navigate this process. Best of luck!",

        "Every case is different, but many people who file bankruptcy keep their car. Is there a reason you say you need to file Chapter 13 Bankruptcy? If you do not make a lot of money and do not have a lot of equity in a home then you may be able to file a Chapter 7 Bankruptcy. I suggest you consult with a Bankruptcy Attorney so you know the differences between the bankruptcy chapters and so you can find out which Bankruptcy Chapter is the best option for you.",
        "You qualify to file a chapter 13 because you have regular monthly income, however, do you have enough to pay all of your debts and continue making your necessary payments?

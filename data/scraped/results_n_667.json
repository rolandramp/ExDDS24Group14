        "No. Social security benefits are specially excluded from the means test. But you may have to include them in schedules I & J. You should consult with and retain a competent bankruptcy attorney to give yourself the best chance on succeeding.",
        "Do not even think about filing a chapter 13 bankruptcy without the assistance of an attorney. If you do, it is a near certainty that your plan will fail.",
        "The bankruptcy code specifically excludes social securityfrom the \"means test\" but it may be necessary to include it in you income and expense (I and J) schedules. Without further information as to who receives the funds and how they are used, it's impossible to say if it should be in the I and J schedules. You should sit down with an experienced bankruptcy attorney to discuss the specifics of this question. Most offer a free initial consultation, and should be able to determine if your daughter's social security should be included in the household income."

        "Even if your employer did not provide you with a copy of the garnishment, that in itself is not going to stop the garnishment. A bankruptcy filing will stop the garnishment or you can call the attorney who issued the garnishment and discuss setting up a payment plan to resolve the debt in lieu of the garnishments. I recommend speaking to some experienced bankruptcy attorneys in more detail to determine your best course of action.",
        "The fastest way to stop the wage garnishment is to file for Bankruptcy. The other issues are not relevant to the validity of the garnishments. To properly answer your questions and address your concerns, the best way to handle this is with an in person consultation with an experienced CA bankruptcy attorney. Use AVVO's Find a Lawyer tool to select a qualified attorney. Good luck. THIS IS NOT LEGAL ADVICE! YOU NEED TO SPEAK TO AN ATTORNEY WHO IS LICENSED IN YOUR STATE FOR LEGAL ADVICE. This is merely suggestions for you to think about in discussing your situation with the local attorney.",
        "Typically you are notified but had you been what would change? A judgment is good for 10 years, can be renewed unlimited number of times and typically carries interest. Is bankruptcy an option?"

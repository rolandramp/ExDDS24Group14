    "question": "How do I surrender real estate in bankruptcy chapter 13? Is it the same as allowing the lender to foreclose? Is there an form I need to complete so that it does not show up as a foreclosure on my credit report? What about taxes? Would I be responsible for deficiency judgment?",
    "answers": [
        "You can indicate in your petition that you are surrendering the property and you can also mention in in the chapter 13 plan. Pursuant to the lender's motion for relief from the automatic stay and the court granting it then the lender can proceed with the foreclosure of the property. As far as credit report is concerned a short sale or deed in lieu of foreclosure looks better if it can be done. In California if the money borrowed for the property was used toward the purchase of the property then there will be no deficiency judgment. You will not be responsible for the taxes on the property being surrendered.",
        "HOA dues that are due and payable up to the date of the filing can be 'included' in the plan. The owner of the property is liable for HOA dues that come due after the filing, up to the time the property is sold.\n\nJCC",
        "You just write in the plan that the property is being surrendered and the automatic stay will terminate as to the property. Once the plan is confirmed the lender will be able to foreclose or send you a deed in lieu of foreclosure (their choice). Whether or not it shows in your credit report as a foreclosure really makes no difference. You are already in bankruptcy so your credit is probably not something you need to worry about at this time or during the term of the C13 plan. Taxes on the property are a debt against the property to surrendered and will be paid by the bank to obtain clear title since property taxes are senior to the first mortgage. Property taxes are a lien on the property only and there is no personal liability of the owner for the taxes. There will be no judgment of any type since you are in bankruptcy. Just for your information, even if no bankruptcy case there is no deficiency judgment possible in CA because foreclosure is almost always nonjudicial (trustee's sale).",
        "You do not surrender real estate in Chapter 13. Your plan of reorganization can provide that you do not make any payments on your mortgage. Your best option if they will not do a loan modification is to hire a realtor and try to do a short sale. If not, see if your lender will accept a deed in lieu of foreclosure. Your credit is already ruined with your BK filing.

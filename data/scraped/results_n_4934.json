        "I'm not entirely clear on your question. You have listed 4 options under the Common Counts form pleading from which the plaintiff may check the pertinent boxes. Your defenses depend on what facts you have to show you don't owe the money. Many times, a defendant (you) can file a \"General Denial\" and attach the so-called, Generic Defenses, (statute of limitations, lack of standing, debt owed by another, etc) unless the complaint is \"verified\" by the plaintiff. You need to see an attorney on this. Of course, if you are eligible to file BK, the lawsuit goes away and will be discharged by the BK court. You can contact me by phone or email if you still have specific questions."

    "title": "How to get out of our solar lease when they never sent a reaffirmation agreement and never told us a lien would be places ?",
    "question": "In California a solar company placed us in the bankruptcy category even though we excluded them from our bankruptcy. They never sent a reaffirmation agreement. They also placed a lien on our home and never told us from the beginning. They sent us to their bankruptcy attorney and payments would be made to him and interest was taken off without another contract being signed.",

        "As stated by other counsel, it appears most of your \"facts\" are incorrect. You cannot exclude a creditor This tells me you did not have the help of a BK lawyer. Solar contracts are sometimes sold using bogus claims of savings on your utilities. About the time you reach a \"break even\" position, the unit needs upgrades, repairs, or replacement. The only good thing appears to be the creditor dropped the interest charge. Depending on how much that changes your overall costs, that is a plus. Better is to renegotiate the balance owed. With proper legal representation, you may be able to get a much better \"deal\" than zero interest.\n\nFind/consult/hire a lawyer using the Avvo feature \"Find a Lawyer\".

        "The first misconception is you can exclude creditors. You cannot pick and choose what creditors are affected by your bankruptcy. You have to list as a matter of disclosure all your creditors. Purposefully failing to list a creditor could lead to that creditor not being discharged, if applicable. By failing to list them, they wouldn't have had notice to provide you with a reaffirmation agreement. If there was a lien already on your home at the time of filing bankruptcy, the lien is unaffected. Additionally, secured creditors may pursue against the collateral (your home) if they are not able to collect from you. So you can't simply just \"abandon\" the secured debt through a bankruptcy."

        "Dear Asker,\n\nThank you for your question. Both LLCs and corporations offer the same liability protection for their owners. The main difference between them is in the management style. Under CA law LLCs have less formalities than that which is required for corporations and are more contract based. The governing instrument in an LLC is the Operating Agreement (which is very important to have in writing). For example, LLCs are not required to have directors, officers or annual meetings by its Board of Directors or owners (as required for CA Corporations). Therefore for smaller companies, LLCs are typically a better fit. However, keep in mind that LLCs cannot issue stock and are often disliked by venture capitalists. If you are not looking for such investors and desire to keep the management of your company relatively simple, then an LLC is the better choice. Also, LLCs offer better asset protection than corporations and can be classified for tax purposes as a Partnership, S-Corp or C-Corp.\n\nIf you'd like more information feel free to contact my firm at 424-270-0064 or email us at info@yevraslaw.com.\n\nThank you & Have a great day,",
        "So assuming you already signed the Franchise Agreement, the Franchisor will only let you transfer to an LLC or corp with a personal guarantee, and same thing with the Landlord if you have found your location. AS the others have advised an LLC is simpler and less expensive to administrate, and would work in the small business situation. If you can buy your equipment in cash, buy it under the LLC name only. Also, I have negotiated with Landlords to perhaps take off the personal guarantee after a couple years of perfect payments. Other things in the lease are totally negotiable so keep that in mind. Most attorneys will give you a set fee for a simple LLC formation and simple operating agreement for you, or you and spouse.\n\nAlso as the others have said, it is extremely prudent to have your Franchise Disclosure Document reviewed by a franchise attorney even though you already signed the franchise agreement, in order to give you all the major concerns you need to keep in mind going forward. It's not just what the contract states, but the disclosure portion contains many reservation of rights for things the franchisor may do in the future at any time (in addition to raising fees and changing the program, and competing and perhaps reducing your territory, etc etc). I highly recommend this kind of Legal Review; it is well worth the small investment to have the knowledge and understanding of what is likely your life savings for this very big business venture. fitness gyms are very competitive, they are all over the place. You should have a good understanding of how yours might give you a competitive disadvantage.\n\nIn addition site location is certainly critical. there are a lot of items to take into consideration on a location not just the area, and the lease will need to be reviewed and negotiated in your favor for some of these. As an example, I had a client with a cardio franchise that when she played the class music, was apparently heard through the adjoining businesses that quickly complained and this ultimately was the unfortunate downfall of her new business. You'll also want to prevent the landlord from putting ANY kind of competitor in the same complex, and many other issues..\n\nMy point is, whether to have an LLC or C corp is a very small legal item compared to the others. Either will work fine and are both taxes the same. The corporation has more administrative requirements.",
        "The election of an LLC over a C or S corp is one based mostly on your financial goals and tax planning needs, so a CPA would be a better source to guide you in that decision. All three entities provide some level of protection from personal liability, but it is imperative you understand the franchise relationship and documents that form it, since most franchisors require personal guaranties as do landlords that may defeat personal insulation of the entities debts. It is important to have the franchise documents reviewed by an experienced franchise attorney who will spend the time insuring you are familiar with the rights and obligations of becoming a franchisee.",
        "A corporation is a more inherently structured entity than an LLC, and therefore an LLC is a more flexible entity, in terms of units of ownership and management. Your question seems to imply that you are the sole owner, so your decision is less complex than if there were multiple owners. Management and tax issues are usually primary, so you would want to consult a business attorney and an accountant to get an answer applicable to you. This is not a decision that can be answered in a general way; it always depends on the exact situation.",
        "This question is best answered considering your long-term goals for the business and your tax situation. You should definitely consult an accountant to help you choose the form that works best for you.",
        "I agree with Mr. Parikh. LLCs are increasingly more commonly used, but your particular situation should be reviewed by a lawyer. You should also get a good CPA on board when starting a business. These two professionals can be a real help.",
        "If you don't plan to issue stock, an LLC is probably better.\n\nHowever, you can have this LLC classified as an S Corp, so you can essentially have the best of both.\n\nA full consultation would be necessary to properly advise you."

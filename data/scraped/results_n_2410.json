    "title": "Do you know anything about loanme.com? I got a loan from them and it appears that they are charging me all kinds of extras.",
    "question": "The amount was for $1,800.00 and it's turning out to be $3.855.00 with all the extra charges. Is this legal? It sure doesn't seem to be legal.",
    "answers": [
        "I just checked their web site. Their site says LoanMe makes unsecured term loans with APRs that can range from 35.52% to 204.94%, depending on the size of the loan.\n\nIf your loan has a 100% annual percentage rate, the $1800 you borrowed becomes $3600 real fast!\n\nLoanme is licensed by the State of California to make such loans. As such, loans on such terms are legal and not subject to state usuary laws.\n\nThe bottom line is that you agreed to the loan terms. Did the loan solve your debt problem, or make it worse?",
        "Probably. If they are properly licensed there's virtually no limit to the interest rates these companies can charge. I always get a little extra satisfaction when I can eliminate these debts for clients in bankruptcy.\n\nGood luck,\n\nRob",
        "Sounds like they are an internet operation or a payday loan outfit. Email me copies of your loan documents for a free case analysis.",
        "I couldn't find a lending license.\n\nCalifornia law caps most interest rates at 10 percent per annum.\n\nIs there any other company name they go by? The BB says they're in Annaheim. That's about all I know, though there are consumer complaints about them here and there."

    "title": "I'm in a Registered Domestic Partnership in CA and plan on buying a home. Don't want my partner on the loan.",
    "question": "My partner has bad credit and we have agreed that we should put the home in my name only. Will a lender look to see if I am in a domestic partnership and want information about partners credit/ income? Will we be treated as a married couple with our RDP in the state of CA in the eyes of a lender?",
    "answers": [
        "One person can qualify for the loan.",
        "I concur with the other attorneys regarding the loan process, but be advised that taking title in your name only can impact the percentage of the home that is considered \"marital property\" versus \"separate property.\" A RDP in CA uses the same property formulas as a marriage, so depending on the source of the down payment funds and mortgage payments, a portion of the home can be deemed your separate property and heirs other than your spouse can be entitled to a portion of the home's fair market value if you should die intestate (without a will or trust).\n\nIf you have a personal revocable trust, you can deed the home into your trust so long as it is a single family home or a dwelling with 5 or fewer discrete housing units and retain your existing loan terms (e.g. an apartment building with 4 units is OK). Once in the trust, you can direct the home's inheritance and ownership however you please.\n\nIf you do not have a trust in place, I would recommend speaking with an estate planning attorney in your area to create one because probate fees can become quite burdensome in California, as they are calculated based on the gross value of your assets, not the net value (therefore if you purchase this new home for $500,000 and put 20% down, your equity is $100,000 but the probate court calculates its fees off of the full $500,000).",
        "You could be the only borrower and if your partners credit is poor, it may not be used or included. Assuming their income is not needed to qualify, the exclusion of your domestic partner and therefore the debts and poor credit is not an issue. Good luck.",
        "I would recommend you speak to a loan broker/agent about this. Form 1003 (universal loan application) does not list registered domestic partners as one of the options. Unless you apply for an FHA loan, lenders typically do not require spouses to be co-borrowers. As long as you can qualify for a loan based on just your income, there is really no reason to be concerned about your partner's bad credit. It is not uncommon for married couples to apply for a loan only in the name of one spouse. Proof of funds may, however, become an issue if the source of your down payment, etc. comes from jointly owned accounts. I am answering this question based on my experience as a real estate broker.",
        "I concur with attorney Santaella.\nDon't think the answer can be improved upon.",
        "Hello,\n\nIn a Registered Domestic Partnership [RDP], you and your partner are treated as a married couple with all of the rights and benefits.\n\nUsually banks consider a spouse's income so it should be no different for you and your partner.\n\nAlso it is common for couples not to include their spouses with poor credit.\n\nGood luck."

    "title": "Homestead Exemption in Chapter 7?",
    "question": "Me & my wife want to file bankruptcy, I know we are only allowed to claim $100,000, our house's current equity is $126,000. Will I loose my home?",
    "answers": [
        "Look at it from the trustee's perspective. Take the value of your home and subtract 7% which represents the Trustee's minimum cost to seize and sell the home. Then subtract the outstanding mortgage and any other liens on the property and your $100,000 homestead exemption. The remaining balance would be what the trustee would get for the creditors. If that number is less than $10,000, the trustee probably wouldn't go after the house. I strongly urge you to consult with a bankruptcy lawyer in your area who is familiar with the practices of the local trustees.",
        "Yes, you are correct, there is a $100,000 homestead exemption under California's 704 set of exemptions. Once you factor in the cost of sale, real estate agent's commission, etc., that leaves very little leftover for creditors so it is not likely the trustee would move to sell the home, however, you should meet with a couple experienced bankruptcy attorneys and definitely hire one for your case. They can look into whether the home is truly worth what you are valuing it at and that may take care of the additional equity you are worried about. You will also want to make sure you don't have any other assets that cannot be protected.",
        "I agree with the above responses, but especially agree that you must hire an experienced bankruptcy attorney to advise you and to represent you in the case. In Sacramento, there are a range of possible outcomes and ways of proceeding depending on which trustee gets appointed. Some trustees might put the house on the market to see fi they get offers that would net enough to pay the mortgage, fees, costs and your exemption amount, with money left over to pay something significant to the creditors. Others my want you to \"buy back\" the unexempt equity. Others may do nothing if they believe that your valuation and other information about the property is accurate.\n\nThere is a lot of pre-filing work that needs to be done in situations like this. In a few cases, a chapter 13 might be recommended as the safest means to give you relief from your debt.\n\nConsult with a local attorney and hire one that you can believe in. You home is important!",

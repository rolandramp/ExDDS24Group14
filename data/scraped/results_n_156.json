        "As stated by other counsel, having the default judgment set aside does not eliminate the adversary action. Your creditor can still pursue the matter to determine the dischargability of the debt. You are in deep, here.\nI strongly suggest you hire your own bankruptcy attorney to deal with the adversary and you can discuss the state court motion with your own attorney who can see the paperwork and review the facts with you.",
        "Your motion to vacate a state court default judgment does not make the creditors AP go away. The AP creditor will have to prove his case in the BK court anew.\n\nBest advice: Find/consult/hire a lawyer in your area using the Avvo feature \"Find a Lawyer\". Make a list of 4-5 having many 5 star reviews from satisfied clients. If you don't get a prompt call back from one, go on to the next on your list.

        "A chapter 7 trustee does not care what you do with a judgment debt. You can still proceed in whatever action you want in state court but that does not make an Adversary Compliant disappear. The State court judge may very well defer the while matter to the BK Court. What is the position of the plaintiff? You may want to consider hiring competent counsel rather than attempting to represent yourself."

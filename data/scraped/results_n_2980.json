        "Not enough facts provided to opine. Suggest you attempt to do both. If you have reasonable defense to liability, prepare to go to court. Contact Ace and attempt to settle on terms you can live with. Prepare to go to court if not settled.",
        "Go to court. ACE will need to bring in witnesses to prove their case. Hearsay evidence is not allowed. No lawyers are allowed in this first hearing. If you win, the case is over. If you lose, you have a right to appeal, with a new trial, and to have a lawyer. And you can still negotiate. They may not want to have a valuable employee waste a full day in court just to get a judgment that they cannot collect upon.\n\nThe representative of ACE must prove that his/her job duties do not include going to court on a regular basis.",
        "If you have evidence that you do not owe this debt, or have paid the debt, you should go to court and fight it. Otherwise, it might be better to negotiate a lower settlement amount outside of court.",
        "You should get the advice of an attorney before making any decisions. Most attorneys that handle debt issues will provide a free consultation to review your circumstances and make recommendations as to how you proceed.\n\nBest of luck to you.",
        "Really not possible to answer over the internet. If their documents are in order, your chances of winning in court may be slim to none, in which case you should probably settle. If a debt collector is involved the case may be winnable. If you are overwhelmed by debt, maybe you should file for bankruptcy protection. Be aware that if you do nothing, you may lose by default.\nBest thing to do is to find a consumer attorney on AVVO and review the details with an attorney before making any decision."

    "title": "Didn't get summons in the mail, court entered default judgement and law firm is sending interrogatories.",
    "question": "Unsecured loan wasn't fully paid because I didn't have all the money. Aggressive and harassing lawyers have been contacting me for a while about satisfying debt, they lied often. I just got a letter saying that the Central Justice Center entered a default judgement against me. I had no idea I was supposed to be in court. Accessing the case through the electronic system, it shows that they served a summons on April 5, then they entered a default judgement on 8/20 for WAY more than I actually owed (judgement: $8600, actual debt: closer to $3000). I haven't even received a Notice of Entry of Judgement in the mail. Today (10/20) I get a letter stating that there's a default judgement against me with interrogatories. Can I contest the judgement? Was the summons served properly? What do I do?",

        "You need to get a copy of the Proof of Service of the Summons and Complaint, a copy of the Complaint and a copy of the Judgment. You may need to visit the courthouse. The Proof of Service will state when and where you were served. If that is not accurate (i.e., \"sewer service\"), you have grounds to set aside the judgment. But, there is a short time limit in which you must act. You will need to prepare the Motion to Vacate, along with the Answer to Complaint.",
        "Unfortunately for our judicial system, more often than not false proofs of service are filed in limited civil debt collection cases. Almost every default collection case I have seen in the last couple of years seems to be a surprise to the Defendant. Why? The Courts just don't care. When we prove a false proof of service was intentionally and fraudulently filed, nobody cares. This could all stop if contempt hearings were held, but that would \"overburden the Courts\" as one prosecutor told me. Aside from that, get a lawyer that knows the system to give you enough information to make a decision.",
        "The first step would be to get a copy of the proof of service of the summons. If you cannot download a copy from the court docket online, you may have to go to the courthouse to request a hard copy. Check the proof of service for the address of service, the person served, and the date and time of service. If the proof of service contains false information and you were not served, you likely have grounds to file a motion to set aside the judgment. If the motion to set aside the judgment is successful, you will then have an opportunity to defend against the debt and contest the amount currently being sought. Without setting aside the judgment, you are unable to otherwise contest the judgment. I suggest you contact a consumer protection attorney to review the proof of service with you as well as discuss your options for setting aside the judgment and defending the underlying claims.",
        "Measure the cost of vacating the default judgment against your chances of winning the case. Its a relatively small amount to justify hiring an attorney. Also, look at your bankruptcy options."

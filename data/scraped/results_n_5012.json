    "title": "How should I respond to a summons (FL-110) for divorce that has mistakes in it?",
    "question": "My husband filed form FL-110, had it served to me cross-country, and I am noticing there are mistakes in it, and misinformation. I am concerned. It doesn't say I am being served as an individual, our date of marriage and separation are off, our property is divided in a strange way . All assets and debts are not listed, it includes over 20k in my husbands credit card debts, but not 10k in my student loan debt. It does not outline a parenting plan, or anything specific regarding out daughter, though my H is implying that I kidnapped her, when I have email communications between us to the contrary, and a notarized travel consent letter stating he knows I was initially coming to stay with family for two months. It's been 4 months. I never denied him any requests for contact. What to do?",

        "Speak to an experienced attorney, who will help you file a Response setting forth what YOU know to be the correct facts. It is not unusual for the Petition not to include a detailed parenting plan.",
        "I agree with attorney Morales. You must file a response to preserve your rights and you can indicate the errors in your husband's paperwork. I highly-recommend retaining counsel in California, as you are at a disadvantage being out of state.",
        "You have 30 days to file a FL-120 and related paperwork. The only way to ensure your property is divided correctly and child custody issues are fairly resolved is by filing the response and going through the court process. If you do not file within 30 days then the court may enter a default judgment and grant your husband everything he is asking for. Don't delay, contact an attorney today and file a response.\n\nMarcus W. Morales, Esq.\nMorales Law\n115 W. Mission St.\nSanta Barbara, CA 93101\nwww.marcusmoraleslaw.com\n(805) 845-5405"

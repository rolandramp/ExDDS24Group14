    "title": "Can the bank take back a house after Chapter 7 is discharged?",
    "question": "We filed chapter 7 about 16 months ago and our bankruptcy trustee did NOT liquidate our house as it had little value. We have not re-affirmed the loan. We are current on our payments, we only ever missed 3 in the past 10 years and have confidence we can and will stay current. Our home value has risen exponentially in the past 6 months due to external factors such as lower crime, better schools etc.",

        "The reason you got conflicting advice is because the responding attorneys read your facts differently. You said you are current, only having \"missed\" 3 payments in 10 years. When you say \"missed\" that could be interpreted as not having paid 3 payments. If you meant \"missed\" as paying late, that is different. If you are current and the \"missed\" payments were eventually paid, your home is not at risk. BTW, the fact that you did not reaffirm the mortgage debt is not a relevant factor. The worst that can happen to you is the lender may have stopped sending you statements or blocked your access to paying electronically. No worries and congratulations on the increased value of your home. Good luck and God bless.",
        "First, your total facts indicate you are no longer in arrears so because you have not defaulted no foreclosure can occur.\n\nSecond, you should call the bankruptcy court and ask \"Has the case been closed\". Not \"discharged\" , but \"closed\". If closed, then the case is over and the house abandoned back to you and no longer the trustee's right to sell . The good news is in CA your post petition increase in FMV unlike here in WA is for your benefit, not the trustees! Thanks for asking here on AVVO. If you ever refinance, because of no reaffirmation, you will proceed through a different mortgage company is all also. Have a great weekend.",
        "The bank can only foreclose on your home if you are three consecutive payments behind on the mortgage and don't get them caught up.",
        "As long as you remain current on your home loan, no, the bank cannot foreclose on your property.",
        "Yes, they can foreclose on your home if you are behind 3 payments that you say you are. They just can't sue you"

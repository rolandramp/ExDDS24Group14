    "title": "If I file a case against a debt collection agency because the fee they placed on me was unreasonable can they sue me back?",
    "question": "I had an about $390 medical debt that went to a debt collector in OCT 2014. The debt collection agency called me in Feb 2015 and told me now the debt was about $620. I asked them how my debt increased so much and they said they charged a 15.9% on the original amount of about $1400 owed. So I asked them why would you charge a 15.9% on the original amount when I only owed $390 and they couldn't really give me a solid reason (they just kept repeating the 15.9%). If I do file a case and win, can the debt collection agency sue me back? (Had a bad experience of prior party suing me back due to a bad attorney.)",

        "There are two recent FDCPA cases in the Eleventh Circuit where the court found violations on small collections that ballooned into large collection amounts because of \"phantom\" fees, and bogus interest and late charges. Go see an attorney that handles FDCPA cases. Mr. Elie is correct. There are FDCPA violations in the collection practices they have used on you.",
        "This sounds like a Fair Debt Collection Practices Act violation.\n\nIts also likely illegal for them to charge you a collection fee, though they may be able to charge interest.\n\nInterest charges may accrue on a debt and may not exceed 10 percent per year. However, if you agreed in writing to pay collection fees or costs of collection, those may be charged to you.\n\nThere are other statutes under the California fair debt collection act besides the federal statute under the Rosenthal Act.\n\nBe advised that there is a 1 year statute of limitations on FDCPA violations.\n\nBefore you haul off and sue, set up an appointment with a debt collection defense lawyer in your area, bring in all pertinent papers including any contracts for medical debt, and the letters you received. Let the lawyer have a look-see for you.\n\nFinally, you can sue in Small Claims in California for a violation of the FDCPA, and the collection agency cannot hire a lawyer to defend itself, it has to send someone in to do the dirty work who is designated to appear for all purposes in the action.\n\nLikewise, the debt collector must sue in Superior Court in the limited jurisdiction division if they wish to try and collect using a lawyer. This is where it could get pricey IF you signed something permitting them to charge attorney fees and costs.\n\nThis is why talking to a lawyer may be helpful. In addition, in FDCPA actions, those can possibly be brought in federal court rather than state court and often they result in statutory damages, attorney fees and costs against the debt collector if it turns out they had no right to charge fees.",
        "You can act or react. When you got the first notice in the mail, you should have demanded verification of the debt. Unless and until that is sent to you, the collection agency can do nothing further. It appears the collection agency is charging you a \"collection fee\". If you want, I will send them a letter demanding the details of the claim.",
        "You have to have a thorough understanding of the debt collection laws before you sue a debt collector. While unauthorized fees could be the basis for a lawsuit, if you guess and you are wrong, you could have to pay the other sides attorney fees for filing a frivilous lawsuit.\nReview the facts carefully with an attorney before filing suit.\nYou can find one on AVVO or use the link below. There is a one (1) year statute of limitations for the federal Fair Debt Collection Act."

    "question": "My cuz is about to complete his chp13 BK. Under trustee financials, looks like the car payments for his car has been completed. But there are some other payments still in progress and expected to complete in couple of months. Can he go ahead and ask the car creditor to send him the certificate of title since his car officially got paid off even if his chp13 case is yet to be complete(but close in completing)? Or he does not have option but to wait until chp13 is officially complete and all other debts discharged? Please advise CA attorneys since my cuz is having a run around from his lawyer since perhaps his case is almost complete.",

    "title": "Will repossession of a vehicle happen before or after CH 7 discharge in California if no reaffirmation agreement is signed?",
    "question": "If I don't sign a reaffirmation agreement, I understand the vehicle could be repossessed by the creditor even if I'm current on the payment and the vehicle is insured. What I want to know is the timing of the repossession â€“ could repossession of a vehicle happen before the discharge or is it always after the discharge?",
    "answers": [
        "First off, repo will only happen in very limited cases and with very few creditors. Last I knew, Ford and Chrysler and several credit unions were enforcing reaffs (since the ride-through provision is no longer what it used to be, i.e., simply staying current on payment without binding contract).\n\nHowever, if you have made every attempt to reaffirm debt and judge denies it, the creditor cannot take car back if you remain current on payments.\n\nAs for when they can repo, if they do. If it is during an open BK, they need a granted motion for relief from the automatic stay. Meaning, they need the court's permission to repo car. If it is after the case is closed, and they wish to enforce their rights to car that was not reaffirmed, then whenever they are ready. Like I said, repos to cars not reaffirmed but with current payments (even for creditors that \"claim to enforce this policy\") are very rare because regardless of whether the creditor has an enforceable contract, they would still rather receive the money each month on the car (presumably with their interest) instead of taking the car back and selling it at auction. Car lenders are in the business of getting monthly payments and interest, not repossessing cars and trying to resell them.",
        "My colleague is right that if your statement of intention does not indicate that you will reaffirm, the Automatic Stay will automatically expire. The 9th Circuit case that governs auto lenders' right to repossess absent a reaffirmation agreement post 2005 (BAPCPA) is In re Dumont, which you can Google.\n\nHowever, in my experience it is rare that the lender will repossess before your discharge comes down and your bankruptcy case is still open.\n\nAlso note that many if not most of the major auto financing companies (Honda and Toyota Financial, but NOT Ford Motor Credit) routinely allow debtors to keep their cars without a reaffirmation agreement. If you're underwater on your car by any significant amount, and you have a lender who will allow you to keep your car without a reaffirmation agreement, it may very well make sense not to sign one. You have to remember that by signing a reaffirmation agreement you are waiving your bankruptcy discharge as to that debt and voluntarily exposing yourself to future liability if you default after bankruptcy. If your lender will allow you to keep the vehicle without a reaffirmation, the only downside for you is that they will not positively report your payments every month to the credit reporting agencies, so paying that loan won't help rebuild your credit.\n\nNote also, though, that just because you sign a reaffirmation agreement in bankruptcy does not mean that your judge will approve it. It has to be filed with the Court in your bankruptcy case, and many Bay Area judges will deny them because they impose an undue hardship on the debtor. In that case, you did perform on your statement of intentions (by trying to reaffirm in good faith). Many judges appear to feel that the lender cannot repossess in that scenario, but that precise issue has yet to come before the 9th Circuit post 2005.",
        "Technically, if you do not perform you statement of intentions within 30 days of the meeting of creditors, the stay ends, and the lender can repossess. Most play it safe and wait until the discharge, but to answer your question, yes they can repossess before discharge.",
        "The laws have been recently changed so that if you want to keep a vehicle, you should reaffirm that debt when you file bankruptcy. In the real world, the non-filing doesn't always mean that the car will be repo'd, especially if the payments are current. It varies by lender and local practice. I am not suggesting not to file a reaffirmation, just pointing that fact out.\n\nA car could not likely be repo'd during the bankruptcy case, and the automatic stay is in effect. While the stay is in effect, the lienholder would have to get the permission of the judge to repo. After the case is closed, and if a reaffirmation is not filed, the lienholder probably has the ability to repossess, should they want to."

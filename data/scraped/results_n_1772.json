    "title": "I have been sued by Midland Funding, LLC but I cannot appear in court because I live overseas. What are my options?",
    "question": "I'm an English teacher overseas. I have very little money and no assets. I have just been informed by my parents that I have received a court order at my legal USA address for unpaid credit card debts ($3,000). I am poor and I have no means of paying and no way of returning to the States to appear in court next month. If I don't show, could they issue an arrest warrant and arrest me the next time I visit? Also, given a default decision, could my parents' property face liens due to my legal address being the same as theirs? Also, could they touch my overseas account? (I have provided my local bank my SSN due to FATCA rules), and could they possibly deny my passport renewal (I'm a naturalized citizen)? My worst fear is extradition or having my working visa canceled here. How likely is that?",

        "Your options are to hire a lawyer to demand the suit, but it would be speculative to predict the result. Or do nothing & the collector will get a default judgment. Many court judgments can never be collected & are good for nothing other than decoration. Just don't keep money in any bank account with a branch in California. Hope this perspective helps.",
        "You won't be arrested. Your passport won't be denied. There us a chance they might chase the money overseas, but it's unlikely.\n\nThe judgment will accrue interest at 10% but you seem to be judgment proof. Your address won't make your parents liable unless you own the property.\n\nGood luck.",
        "No. You cannot be arrested for simple failure to pay a debt or judgment based on facts provided.\nNo. Passport cannot be deinied.\nYes. Based on facts provided, you may have chance at setting aside the judgment.\nYes. Creditor can levy on overseas account. Not likely based on cost of taking this enforcement action. You will be notified if creditor attempts to do this.",
        "It is a civil lawsuit, not a criminal prosecution. The failure to pay a civil judgment does not lead to arrest. As far as your parents' home is concerned, ownership is determined by whose name is on the legal title, not who receives mail at an address. If you are not on title, the creditor cannot lien your parents' property.\n\nThe civil Summons does not require that you personally show up in court. If you wish to contest the lawsuit, you file an \"Answer\" with the court. Your Answer can list your current (overseas) address as your address of record for purposes of the lawsuit. The court will then set a trial date in 2016, about a year from now. You are not legally required to attend the trial, but if you do not appear, the court will probably enter a civil judgment against you at that time."

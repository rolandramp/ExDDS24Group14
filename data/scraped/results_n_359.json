    "question": "California. I have been informally separated from my wife for over 3 years. She leased an expensive vehicle in a 2 year contract. The vehicle was stolen in Mexico. She did not have insurance for the vehicle to go into Mexico. The finance company is demanding payment. Her lawyer said that I need to sign her bankruptcy declaration because we are married. What happens to me if I sign it?",

        "I agree with much of what has been said before me on this thread. I also think that it is likely that your separated spouse is requesting that you sign a \"Spousal Waiver\" which relates to the set of exemptions (asset protection rules) that will be applied in her case. From time to time I am representing Debtors that must request their separated spouse sign such a waiver. It is entirely possible that there is something else going on in her case all together. GOOD LUCK!",
        "First, you do not need to sign papers if those papers make you a debtor in the case. But the attorney may be asking you to sign a waiver so that your wife can claim certain exemptions of assets in her case. As another attorney has already said, you should have your own attorney look at the documents and explain what you are being asked to sign. There is a self-help clinic on Wednesday afternoons at the San Diego Bankruptcy Court and someone could probably help you get a full answer to your questions.",
        "California has two sets of exemption laws that are available to protect property of those who file for bankruptcy. One set (the 704's) can be used without any permission from a non-filing spouse.\nThe other set (the 703's) requires that the non-filing spouse sign a waiver which states that if you file a bankruptcy case while your wife is in her bankruptcy case, you will also use the 703 exemption laws.\n\nIf you do not agree to let her use the 703 exemptions, you may have community property assets that cannot be protected properly and may be taken by the trustee and sold to pay her creditors. Without knowing more details than you should publicly disclose, it is difficult to advise you exactly what will happen if you do not sign the waiver. You might contact her attorney yourself and see if that person is willing to explain what might happen if you do not sign the waiver.",

    "answers": [
        "Can you declare bankruptcy? Always a yes, however whether it is wise and you will not be dismissed is another question. I like to evaluate potential cases in the following manor:\n1. do you qualify based upon your income and family size?\n2. Have you filed a prior bankruptcy within 8 years?\n3. How much debt do you have and does that make a bankruptcy worth it compared to your income.\n4. Finally, will you have to forfeit any assets at all?\n\nSpeak with a licensed professional to address these concerns.",
        "How much equity you can protect is dependent on which exemption set you use. Others have discussed the exemption amounts. It's likely you can protect all of the equity. Best of luck!",
        "I assume that the $100,000 equity that you are talking about is equity in your home. If that is correct, there are 4 possibilities.\n\n1) If you are \"disabled\" you could protect $175,000 in equity in your home. What concerns me is the statement that \"works pt ti.me\" There are a lot of potential issues. You may or may not be able to use that $175,000 disability exemption.\n\n2) You may still be able to use the $175,000 exemption if you are over 55 years old AND you have a limited amount of income.\n\n3) If you have other people living with you (spouse / dependents) you may be able to protect $100,000 in equity in the home.\n\n4) If you don't qualify for any of those you would still have a $75,000 exemption.\n\nAll this presumes that this property is where you live. Also it presumes that you have lived in CA at least 2 years (otherwise you may NOT qualify to use CA exemptions.)\n\nThe biggest concern I have is that you may not know the exact value of you home. It could be more than the exemption allows or it may reach that while your case is open, in which case the bankruptcy trustee could sell the home and give the exempt amount to you and pay the creditors with the difference.\n\nThere is something I call the \"shadow exemption.\" that is where the equity is more than the exempt amount but less than the trustee could get selling the house AFTER cost of sale is considered.\n\nI would suggest that you get a REAL, HONEST APPRAISAL.\n\nIf the equity is close to the allowed exemption, you may need to do a \"motion to compel the trustee to abandon the home back to you.\n\nYou may be able to keep your home only to lose vehicles or other assets.

        "You can certainly file a Chapter 7, but you probably should not, at least not on your own. Please consult with an experienced local bankruptcy attorney. You need to have someone review all the facts in your case and provide experienced legal judgment before filing any bankruptcy. If you have that much equity, you can not afford a mistake that will arise from trying to do this yourself.",
        "You can always declare Chapter 7 bankruptcy, the questions to ask are whether you are eligible for a discharge in the Chapter 7 bankruptcy and what property can you protect if you file a Chapter 7 bankruptcy. You don't specifically state what asset it is that has \"100k in equity,\" however, whether the equity is in your home (as I suspect) or in a combination of other assets, you should speak to a knowledgeable consumer bankruptcy attorney. The attorney will look at whether a homestead was declared properly if you are dealing with real property and whether you are eligible for the homestead exemption, and will be able to look at what other exemption will be of benefit to you. Also, if a Chapter 7 bankruptcy is not in your best interest, the attorney would be able to discuss alternatives with you (such as a Chapter 13 bankruptcy).",

        "What is your $100k in equity? A house? A car? If its in your house, you might be able to protect it depending on other factors.

I would advise you sit down and speak with a qualified attorney."

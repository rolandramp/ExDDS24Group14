        "You may be asking the wrong question. Equity is calculated like any other mortgage. However, what you want to know is \"How will the Bankruptcy Trustee treat this house that is subject to a reverse mortgage?\" You want to know if the Trustee is going to sell the house. The Trustee has the rights of hypothetical judgment lien creditor. Most reverse mortgages are set up in a way that a judgment lien can attach but not foreclose during the lifetime of the owner. You should consult an attorney to review your documents, but it is likely the Trustee would not attempt to sell the property even if your mother has more equity than the homestead exemption allows.",
        "As a general rule, the equity is determined by deducting 8% (for sales costs if the property were to be sold), less the balance owing on the reverse mortgage if she as to see the property today. From that, she could deduct the homestead to which she s entitled, which is anywhere from $75,000 to $175,000, depending upon a number of factors. You and/or your mother should consult with an experienced bankruptcy attorney wth a free consultation to help ensure that she does not lose her home.",

        "As indicated by attorney Whitaker, the value of the home less the mortgage balance (not including any additional balance to lend) would determine her equity. She should be talking to an experienced bankruptcy attorney in her are to determine that calculation and to what exemptions she may be entitled.",
        "I concur with atty Whitaker. Equity is the difference between what the property is worth less the balance owed on the mortgage. A debtor can exempt up to $175K depending on age, disabilities, how many live in the home. Talk to several BK lawyers in the area and hire one who: (1) Promptly returns your call; (2) Offers a free consultation by phone or in person; (3) Is willing to discuss fees; (4) Doesn't confuse you with legal mumbo-jumbo; (5) Has excellent client recommendations on Avvo or some other review system. Virtually all in pro per Chapter 13 cases are dismissed without lawyer assistance.",
        "It's essentially the same calculation. Subtract the current payoff of the mortgage (not including available funds not yet paid out) from the current fair market value. If it's well under $200,000, it can likely be exempted."

        "The simple answer is no as explained in the two prior answers. Section 522(f) is used to void judgment liens that infringe on a debtor's exemption in his or her real estate used as a personal resident. However, this cannot be used to void a mortgage which is a voluntary lien.",
        "As my colleague has said, you cannot avoid consensual liens under section 522(f), which is probably what you're thinking of. But car title loans are not legal in all states. Talk to your lawyer, because you may have rights under state law.",
        "No. You can redeem the vehicle by paying what it is worth, but cannot avoid a voluntary lien on your car (see section 522)."

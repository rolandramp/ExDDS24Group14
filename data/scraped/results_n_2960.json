        "Judgments can be renewed indefinitely, but generally only reported for 7 years on your credit report. After 7 years you should dispute the reference if it's still being reported. If the judgment is small, you may want to work out a deal with the creditor to resolve it. Contrariwise, you may want to consult a bankruptcy attorney if the judgment is large. These judgments generally accrue 10% interest, so putting it off in the hopes it goes away is usually not a good strategy.\n\nGood luck!\n\nRob",
        "A judgment in CA is good for 10 years. It can be renewed during that term of another 10 years, etc. The FCRA requires the removal at 7 years from the \"date of entry, or until the governing statute of limitations has expired, whichever is longer.\" A renewed judgment, therefore, may appear on your credit report for longer than 7-10 years in CA, i.e., as long as 20 years. However, in practice, all three major credit reporting agencies remove judgments after 7 years.",
        "In CA a judgment can remain on your credit report as long as enforceable. Enforceable for 10 tears. Can be renewed indefinitely. Can remain of credit report forever. Creditor may be callig your employer for a number if reasons including, not limited to: verification of income; verification of employment; to obtain information in preparation of placing a levy or EWO. Consult BK counsel for possible defenses."

    "title": "How many times can you convert your bankruptcy case once you file?",
    "question": "I am thinking of filing a CHapter 7 bankruptcy this month. However, I am not sure if I will be able to afford my house payments early next year so I am thinking if I cannot then a 13 sounds better. If I file a bankruptcy case now, are there an unlimited amount of times I can convert my case or can I do it just once?",
    "answers": [
        "The law doesn't specify a limit, but there are other issues involved that you may not have considered. While asking a question in a public forum can provide you with useful information about the law, it isn't possible to speculate how many angels can dance on the head of a pin or how often you can convert between Chapter 7 and Chapter 13 before time runs out and the Court pulls the plug on playing this game - especially if the facts show that you lack \"good faith\" in the relief you are seeking. Hope this perspective helps!",
        "The real issues here are these:\n\n1. A Chap. 7 will be discharged in 90 days and closed shortly thereafter (usually). Once that happens, you cannot convert anything since there is no active bankruptcy.\n2. If you're having a problem with paying for your house, a Chap. 13 won't help you with that. With either bankruptcy, if you wish to keep the house, you'll have to be current (and maintain currency) on the mortgage(s). If you don't, they can foreclose under either scheme. In fact, a 13 would make your monthly house payment HIGHER because you'd have to (a) make the regular payment, and (b) pay a pro-rata portion of the delinquent amount every month throughout the plan.",
        "Why do you think that if you cannot afford your house in the next year a 13 will be better? You should really find a local bankruptcy attorney and sit down for a consultation. You will undoubtedly be able to find one that will do a free consultation. That way you can get your situation assessed and be armed with knowledge to make a well thought out decision.",
        "If you file a Chapter 7 case right now. The case most likely will be complete and closed in the next 4-6 months. You wont be able to go back and convert it to a Chapter 13.\n\nIn any case, if you qualify for a Chapter 7, you most likely will not be able to afford a Chapter 13. More importantly, if you file the Chapter 7 case (so long as you do not reaffirm the debt on the mortgage), you can walk away from the home without incurring any deficiencies. I suggest that you speak with an experienced bankruptcy attorney. The attorney will be able to better understand your decision and give you informed advice."

        "You would only have a proposed order if you completed a trial, if you entered a default and have requested a Judgment or you have a stipulation with the other party and requested the entry of Judgment by stipulation. Otherwise, all other rulings will be by and through a proposed order after hearing or failure to object to the court’s tentative ruling. Other than that, the lines become a little murky based upon the parties various and different types of stipulations. For instance, a number of property issues will be dealt with during the trial and the Judge will make a determination of the respective parties’ interest in the property separate and related to the communal relationship. During a Motion by stipulation and at any time, the parties may reach an agreement concerning property issues and request an order that reflects the stipulated agreement even though this is only an order that would have the same force and effect as the Judgment in regard to those specific property items, i.e. she keeps the BMW and he keeps the Mercedes but each party would be responsible for any and all debts against their respective vehicles.",
        "Generally, an \"order\" relates to an interim ruling by the court on a procedural matter or a ruling on a dispositive motion that does not fully adjudicate all issues in a case. A \"judgment\" is the final ruling or award by the court that fully resolves all matters between the parties."

        "Ignoring for a second that your question is borderline gibberish, what would make you think that it's OK to take money from a casino, and then stop payment on a check to them? You owe them money. If you don't pay your debts, negative things can happen to your credit. Since you stopped payment on a check, you may have additional liability on that as well. You need to stop talking about this online and talk to an attorney immediately.",
        "I apologize for the prior answers you received. To answer your question, if the Casino goes to small claims court and gets a judgment against you this will definitely affect your credit rating.\n\nWhen they issued you a check against funds in your bank account you were writing them a check just as if you were writing a check to pay a utility bill or to pay for services. By either writing the check with insufficient funds to cover it or stopping payment on the check without a valid dispute (losing money at the casino is not a valid dispute, you could have taken the money they gave you and bought groceries instead of gambling) you may have additional consequences that you should discuss with a local attorney.",
        "Please try to use correct grammar and spelling so that I can understand you. Ask a specific question, and you will get an answer. If you tell a story instead of including a specific question, everyone will need to try to guess what you are asking.",
        "You question cannot be understood as written."

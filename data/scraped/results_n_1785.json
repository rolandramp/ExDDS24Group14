        "You should file your petition for dissolution of marriage or legal separation right away and have your husband served. Once this occurs, there are Automatic Temporary Restraining Orders that go into affect (ATROS) that will restrain him from making any big financial changes such as removing you from an insurance policy or closing financial accounts. In your dissolution proceeding you will each be required to disclose all of your assets and debts, as well as your income, to one another. Since you know enough about this account to track it down there isn't a huge risk for non-disclosure. However, you will want to comb through his account statements to ensure he wasn't diverting money anywhere else either.\n\nIn addition, a spouse may be required to reimburse the community (i.e. you and your spouse as a joint financial entity) for the misuse of community assets if you can prove that the educational fund deposits were a misuse. This may be difficult to do in light of the fact that they are your children together, i'm assuming, but if the amounts were very substantial and appear to be a diversion of funds then it is possible. I would consult with a family law attorney in person who has all the facts before moving forward.\n\nGood luck to you.",
        "It sounds like you haven't yet filed your divorce petition, If that's so, then the only wrong your husband has committed is not telling you about the account.

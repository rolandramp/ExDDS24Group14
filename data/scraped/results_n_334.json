    "title": "Would me filing chapter 13 bankruptcy affect my fiancé if we get married and can we still file taxes jointly?",
    "question": "Currently debating filing chapter 13 to rid some debt an ex from a few years ago ran up in my name. Debt consolidation fell through and I suffered a 20K/yr pay cut recently. I have a fiancé and we want to marry soon, but I’m not sure If us getting married will affect him. We have no joint bills and none of the debt is in his name, but would be filing taxes jointly. Can the trustee take our entire refund?",

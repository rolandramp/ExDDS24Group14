        "Some items purchased on store credit are actually secured, meaning the items can be repossessed. However, if you listed them in the bankruptcy, and they had full notice and did not object then I doubt there is much that they can or will do. Send them proof of your bankruptcy filing with proof that they(Best Buy and/or the lender) were listed in the bankruptcy. It would be a good idea to call your bankruptcy attorney.",
        "If your bankruptcy was discharged all the debts you listed on your bankruptcy forms are included. It is not uncommmon however after a bankruptcy that firms will write asking you or even telling you you must re-affirm your debt to them. This is nonsense. Don't even write them back."

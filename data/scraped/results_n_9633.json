    "title": "Time restraint on debts incurred prior to filing bankruptcy",
    "question": "I work for a small finance company and I remember reading somewhere that there is a time restraint on debts that can be discharged through bankruptcy. If I remember correctly, it seems like debts incurred three months prior to filing bankruptcy cannot be discharged, but when I spoke to someone about it, they told me it was actually six months. I tried to find it again, and now I cannot find anything. I am probably just not searching with the right words, so I thought I would ask the experts.",

        "There is a presumption that debts incurred within 90 days of filing were incurred without the intent or ability to repay. This means the burden is on you to prove that there was no fraud involved. Outside 90 days the presumption shifts to the creditor so the creditor must prove that you did not have the intention to repay the charges that were made. It makes it more difficult for the creditor to prove their claim, however it does not prevent them from trying to make it non-dischargeable. Exceptions to discharge is discussed in 11 USC 523.\n\nLEGAL DISCLAIMER\nMr. Larkin is licensed to practice law in CA and is located in San Diego.

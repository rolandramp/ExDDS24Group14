    "title": "I was garnished without proper notification. Why are they immune to accommodating basic civil rights?",
    "question": "I had a business from 07/2012-09-2013. A nightmare unleashed with the local fire disaster. I was forced to lose my investment. Since then, it's been one tax battle, appeals, complaints for not being allowed to appeal timely but instead, show up years later with a lien on my last $50. I have since filed bankruptcy and they have reappeared with a post bankruptcy amount due. Is any of this legal? Where are my rights?",

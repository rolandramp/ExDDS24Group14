        "There is no stay anymore with respect to you personally, as the case is discharged. But, that's the whole point - you've gotten your discharge, so while they may be able to get the property, they can't come after you anymore. Let them take the property but you're home free.",
        "The stay of an act against property of the estate continues until the property is no longer property of the estate.The stay of any other act continues until the earliest of:\n\n1. the time the case is closed;\n2. the time the case is dismissed; or\n3. the time a discharge is granted or denied.\n\n11 U.S.C. 362(c)\n\nIn your situation, there is no automatic stay in place to be lifted. If the creditor is unsure about whether or not the stay is in place, they should just wait until the case is closed, which should be soon if your case is a \"no asset\" case and you have already received a discharge.",
        "In bankruptcy, the automatic stay (the temporary injunction) turns into the discharge (the permanent injunction). Creditors cannot pursue debts you included in your bankruptcy as a result of the discharge.",
        "The automatic stay which goes into effect upon filing the bankruptcy terminates upon discharge, so there is nothing to get relief from. However, the discharge injunction goes into effect upon entry of discharge (11 USC 524) which gives you protection against collection efforts. I have never seen a creditor ask for relief from the discharge injunction. If you are plannning to surrender the property that secures the debt, you should start that process at this time. Usually what causes problems at this stage of bankruptcies is a reaffirmation agreement, which does not appear to exist here. It is unclear what the creditor wants, but you could remind the creditor of the provisions of the discharge injunction.",
        "The discharge ends the stay as to you personally. But until the case is closed, the stay remains in place as to proceeding against any property that might belong to the bankruptcy estatte.\n\nSo say you have a car loan that you are delinquent on. As long as the case is open, the creditor must file a motion to lift stay, because although the stay is lifted as to you, the trustee could conceivably sell the car & use the cash to pay the creditors. You would not have standing to oppose the lift stay motion, but the trustee would be able to oppose it. Of course, that's never going to happen, but that is the theory we use in Nevada.\n\nHope this perspective helps!"

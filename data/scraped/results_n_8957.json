        "You say \"my unemployment income (currently on appeal) might not be able to cover the payments, taxes and insurance\". It sounds like the only way you are going to be able to keep your house is if you can somehow lower the payments. It appears that you need a loan modification to keep the house. You need to talk to your lender. A chapter 7 won't allow you to lower your mortgage payments. But it will allow you to get rid of your unsecured debts which might make paying your mortgage easier. A chapter 13 will allow you to pay off the past due amounts (if any) over the life of your plan. But the court does not have the power to change the terms of your mortgage. Check HAMP and see if you qualify for a loan modification.",

You should check with a bankruptcy attorney before deciding on the type of case that is right for you.

        "You asked, \"do I name the tax collector as a creditor?\"\nYes, you do. List the County Treasurer on Schedule D.\n\nIf you haven't been paying the mortgage, then what's your intent regarding your property? If you just want to surrender the house, and if you're eligible for Chapter 7 relief in order to discharge your personal liability for your dischargeable debts (see a lawyer!), then you can go ahead with a Chapter 7 filing.\n\nIf you want to keep your house, then you may need to consider a Chapter 13 filing. That's because if you file Chapter 7 but you're behind on your mortgage payments, the creditor might pursue a Motion for Relief from Stay, and obtain a Court order that allows the creditor to go ahead with a foreclosure sale. Another possibility is that the creditor will just wait until the Chapter 7 case is over and closed. Even after receiving an order of discharge, the creditor can still foreclose on your house if you're behind on your mortgage payments. That's because a Chapter 7 filing does not \"eliminate\" mortgage arrears. Your personal liability would be discharged, but a mortgage (plus the arrears) would remain as a secured claim against your home.\n\nIn Chapter 13, you can propose a payment plan to cure the mortgage arrears over a period of 36 to 60 months. If you have more than 1 loan against your house, you may be able to do \"lien stripping\" in Chapter 13 to remove the junior loans.\n\nRegarding home insurance, a bankruptcy filing will protect you as far as your personal liability is concerned. However, a bankruptcy filing may affect your ability to get affordable insurance, if that's what you're trying to ask, due to the impact that a bankruptcy filing will have on your credit score.\n\nYou will need a consultation with an attorney to cover these issues, plus many other issues.",
        "The taxes and other debts have to be listed in the bankruptcy. If you want to keep the house they will have to be repaid in a chapter 13. If you give the house up and file bankruptcy you will not be responsible for the taxes.\n\nChapter 7 permits the debtor to get rid of all of their unsecured debt without having to make payments to that debt. It is not a good choice for people who are behind on their mortgage and want to save their house from foreclosure. It is an excellent choice if you want speed and simplicity.\n\nYou must qualify for a 7. The tests are income versus ALLOWABLE expenses (term of art...need a lawyer) \"liquidation\" (do you have equity in property that is not protected by an exemption (law stuff again) and the \"means test\"...one of the stupidest things Congress has ever thought up (and I am a conservative Republican) which asks are you an above or below median (half above/half below) income household.\n\nChapter 13 is a bankruptcy where you are required to make a monthly payment for 36 or up to 60 months. The basis of the payment is never unsecured debt. It is affected by the tests outlined above. Filing this bankruptcy will stop a foreclosure and allow you to repay the mortgage arrears at zero percent interest.\n\nDisclaimer: This answer does not constitute legal advice.

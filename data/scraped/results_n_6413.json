    "title": "I owe American Express $50,000 and can only pay $500/month. Amex sent me to a collection agency. What do I do?",
    "question": "I purchased the $50K of items with my Amex for my ex-bf as he promised to pay me back. He has not and I don't believe he will as I've learned that he's a fraud. He owes me a total of $95K. I'd like to seek legal action.",
    "answers": [
        "In reviewing the other attorneys' responses, they explained your options and have offered you great tips, including getting an attorney, if the ex-bf has anything to collect or if you simply want a judgment against him that is uncollected, if this guy is underground.\n\nConcerning the AmEx credit card, they will likely sue you for this large an unpaid amount, as I have represented several clients against AmEx for large balances. Settling may be a better bet, so that they don't sue you and have to add court costs and attorney's fees. Perhaps if you have some financial hardship, they can offer you a discount on the principal and interest rate, so that you can pay this off faster. My legal guide on Avvo for settling is linked below. I have also written a blog on settling and how much.\n\nRobert Stempler (please see DISCLAIMER below)\nwww.StopCollectionLawsuits.com\nTwitter: @RStempler",
        "The items that you charged may not constitute \"consumer debt\", so your rights may be limited by that fact. You really need to hire an attorney to review the details of your situation. You need to deal with American Express before they sue you. I expect that they will sue, as they gave you a substantial credit line in the belief that you have income or assets. As far as going after your ex bf, you can, and probably sue, him, but do not expect to actually recover anything as he probably does not have assets. Do he have a job?",
        "You may have some available remedies for this situation and the fraud; however, as stated by another attorney, considering the amount of money involved and the potential criminal aspect of fraud, you should consult an attorney in your area. Most will meet with you for a free consultation. Bankruptcy may be an option, but if everything was recently purchased or was luxury items, you may not qualify or have all of your debts discharged.",
        "With that amount of money at stake, you really need to hire an attorney to collect the $95K from him, and to settle the $50K with AmEx."

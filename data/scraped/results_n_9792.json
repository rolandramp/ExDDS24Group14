    "title": "My wife and I are getting a divorce, but now she wants alimony.",
    "question": "My wife and I have been married for four years, and now we're getting a divorce. She now wants alimony, even though she makes more than I do, however she said that she'll just cut back on her hours so that it looks like I make more. She was illegal in this country before I married her, now after supporting her throughout the marriage she wants a divorce. Is there a way to not give her alimony, and still retain all of the marital assets, and perhaps gain alimony from her?",

        "Alimony (spousal support here in CA) is a complex issue.

        "There are various ways to go about solving this problem, and not necessarily all of the involve litigation, unless you want to end up in divorce court. Your husband can talk to the tribal counsel and have them send you part of the income. You are never entitled to \"all of\" your spouses assets, upon divorce the court will do a \"net\" equal division. You need to understand that the tribe is a separate nation, and therefore the California courts take the position that his per-capital is HIS SEPARATE property. It is reachable for child and spousal support, but assets purchased with this SEPARATE property are NOT community property assets - they are HIS separate property. This comes as a great shock to many spouses. If you wish to have the property purchased with per-capita separate property income from the tribe- you will have to do a valid written transmutation agreement, and comply with both the California Family Code and Probate code sections, as transmutation agreements are disfavored in California and will not be upheld unless you comply fully with the requirements of the code. If you do that, the court can and will uphold a written agreement to transmute the property from separate to community. This is highly technical and you need the assistance of competent legal counsel to get it done right.\n\nHope this helps,\n\nDeloise E, Tritt",
        "You are NOT entitled to ALL of your husband's assets. You are entitled to one-half of the net community estate, which means one-half of all items acquired during the marriage (that are not otherwise impacted upon by separate property contributions of either party) less one half of allk debts acquired by either of you during the marriage. You can get spousal support from your husband (depending upon your respective financial circumstances) but you will need to file a court action to that if he refuses to give you money voluntarily. You should speak with an experienced family law attorney if you can afford one. Good luck."

    "title": "Do I qualify for Chapter 13 if I have negative disposable income on the means test?",
    "question": "I have 2 homes - one I live in and one rental. Both have equity. Attorney told me I have to file a Chapter 13. He said on the \"means test\" my income is over median and my \"disposable income\" is negative $200. But my actual income and expenses I have $500 left over each month which I see he listed on the bankruptcy paperwork. So will the court look at the means test disposable income or my actual disposable income?? Will my Chapter 13 get approved? Do I have to do a 5 year plan? My unexempt property amount would be paid in the bankruptcy plan in 3 years with $500 plan per month. Attorney told me I can't file and I think he is wrong. I would be paying 20% back to creditors. Let me know if you need more info.",

        "There are several factors in determining your payment. The 2 big ones are the excess income and liquidation analysis. If you make \"too much\" for a chapter 7 you will have the option of paying your creditors through a chapter 13. Additionally, while you may qualify for a chapter 7 (income insufficient to pay regular monthly bills and having not filed a 7 within 8 years) due to the value of your assets it might be best to file a chapter 13. This sounds the case you have. The big discussion then is what is your payment and is that a reasonable payment? I have had cases with very low income that due to liquidation had a large, unreasonable payment. These usually result in the most stress for clients as they are not pleased with the payment calculation. Find out not just what your payment is, but why its that payment. That might help you to understand better the advice you are receiving.",
        "Having a negative disposable monthly income on the Means Test may be an indicator that a chapter 13 plan isn't feasible and might be considered by the court, but it certainly doesn't disqualify you for chapter 13. I have filed numerous chapter 13 plans and had them confirmed under those circumstances.\n\nThe other questions you ask should be taken up with an attorney experienced in chapter 13 in your area. Many general practice attorneys just don't know the full story about how a chapter 13 works and many bankruptcy attorneys also limit their practice to chapter 7, so seek someone that files a good number of chapter 13 cases successfully. I think you need to take your information and get another opinion. The attorney you talked to may be correct, but based on what you said it's worth another look.",
        "You can certainly file, but whether you can confirm a plan or whether you should is a totally different story. Why do you want to file? Do you have arrears on either property or do you have lots of unsecured debt. It sounds like you wanted to file a Chapter 7, but your income is too high and you do not qualify. Why did the attorney tell you that you cannot file? The means test is for a Chapter 7 and the disposable income is for a Chapter 13. If you are over the median, the repayment period will be five years.\n\nChapter 13 is extremely formulaic. A plan payment takes many factors into account, such as unexempt equity, total unsecured debt, arrears on either property, taxes, disposable income, etc. The real question is whether the $500.00 that have left over when you subtract your actual income and expenses is enough for the minimum Chapter 13 plan payment.\n\nUnfortunately, Riverside (the place where you will file) is debtor unfriendly. It is an extremely difficult place to confirm a plan. They try to maximize the amount that is paid to the creditors. They scrutinize over every expense. You may say you only have $500.00 in disposable income, but they may say you have $1,000.00. You may say you only have to pay 20% to unsecured creditors, but they may say you need to pay 100%.\n\nYou need a detailed analysis of your situation, which is not something we can do on a public site. You need to get a consultation from an experienced Bankruptcy attorney who practices regularly in Riverside. Riverside is its own world.",
        "In chapter 13, the Means Test controls two things, the lenghth of your plan (60 months since you had to complete the test), and the minimum payment you must make each month. Since your means tezt result is below $0, your budget determines your payment amount, proving my theoty that it is ALWAYS the budget that decides. So make sure your budget is solid and that every expense can be documented because it is likely you will have to prove it line by line to get a confirmed plan. Hope this perspective helps!",
        "If your income on the means test is negative, you get a presumption that a Ch.7 should go through. Then everyone looks at whether you are keeping a property or a debt that skews the formula e.g. are you spending too much money on a luxury car that if given up would allow you to pay much more to the creditors. If everything is done correctly, your actual income and expenses don't matter too much, but I would hesitate before putting down a $500 surplus. That's inviting problems.",
        "If your income is over median ordinarily you are going to be in a 60 month plan, but if you actually have excess income you can fund a chapter 13. Having said that, I don't know what you consider your real budget, so without knowing that, I don't know if you have a viable chapter 13. If you're not sure about what your attorney is telling you, go get an in person second opinion from another experienced bankruptcy attorney."

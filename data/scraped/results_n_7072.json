    "question": "I just file bankcruptcy on mar 23, 2012 & my attorney said I wouldn't get my case number until 10 days from then. Can I file taxes now? I also owed money from military star card which allows them to garnish my tax refund. Will they garnish it with even though I filed bankcruptcy?. If they do garnish my tax refund, will I get the money back since I already filed my bankcruptcy?",

        "Filing taxes is required with or without having a bankruptcy case number.\n\nYou are filing taxes for last year, 2011\n\nIf star card is government, remember that government can take from itself the refund.\n\nThe refund goes toward your debt.\n\nYou might get it back if trustee reverses it and if the amount is within your exemptions.",
        "You get your case number on filing, not 10 days later. You and your creditors will get a notice of filing in about 10 days, which is probably what your attorney meant. At any rate, it's been my experience that if you get your bk filed before filing your tax return, your tax refund will not be intercepted for the Star card account. I think you're even less likely to have a problem if you wait until your discharge to file your tax return. Won't cost you anything to file an extension if you're getting a refund. Hopefully you have listed an exempted your anticipated refund on your bankruptcy schedules.\n\nRob Taylor\nwww.affordableattorneysgroup.com",
        "You should have case number immediately upon filing the petition - no delay (not an important issue).\n\nTaxes:\nYou should have made \"exempt\" your anticipated tax refund within your bankruptcy case, assuming you have available exemptions remaining. If so, those monies should be protected from the reach of creditors.\n\nThe debt related to the \"star card\" should be included in your case, as well. ALL creditors where your debt includes any balance more than $0.00 owing at the time of filing MUST be included in one's bankruptcy petition. This is the correct way to handle creditors. Depending on the nature of the debt/creditor, perhaps the star card receives priority status as a debot owed to the government. Or instead, it may possibly be unsecured debt (and therefore dischargeable). Your attorney should advise on nature of this debt and whether scheduled for discharge.\n\nThese factors determine whether your tax refund may be \"garnished\". Still, no garnishment should take place DURING your bankruptcy case, UNLESS a creditor (including star card creditor, etc) seeks relief from the automatic stay. This occurs in the form of a Motion for Relief from Stay and a hearing on the matter. Something that would need to be filed by the creditor itself. It is possible to contest or oppose such motion, if you so choose.\n\nAgain, these considerations are best left to discussions between you and the attorney you have hired to represent you through this case.\n\nBest of luck!!"

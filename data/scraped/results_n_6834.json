    "title": "I hired an unlicensed contractor and now I found out he is an illegal alien? Is it a waste of time to sue him??",
    "question": "He was hired to install wood flooring and painting, did a real good job but due to him not getting along with my fiancee he stopped coming to the house and did not finish. He said he would finish the job if my fiancee was not home but that was impossible. Now I find out he is not even legal in this country, is it worth my time to sue him?? All I have is a estimate/contract signed by both of us and a receipt that his brother signed for him for the first half of the money.",

        "What do you want to sue him for, for the money you paid him that as my colleagues note, he's not entitled to collect since he's unlicensed? To finish the job? Apparently he's willing to do that if your fiancee isn't there.\n\nIf getting good quality work is what counts, make it possible for him to finish the job, and honor your agreement and pay him what you agreed to pay him. If you think you could collect a judgment from him and you don't think it's fair that he got anything from you, then sue him.",
        "Attorney Brady put it well. In California, it is illegal for an unlicensed person to perform contracting work on any project valued at $500 or more in labor and materials. California Business & Professions Code section 7031(a) prevents an unlicensed contractor from collecting on debts owed to them by consumers under contracts due to their unlicensed status. This means that a court will not enforce the illegal contract.\n\nFurthermore, California Business & Professions Code section 7031(b) gives consumers who have contracted with unlicensed contractors the ability to sue for restitution or reimbursement of all monies paid to the unlicensed contractor for \"any act or contract\".\n\nIn short, an unlicensed contractor will not only be unable to collect against the owner but may actually be liable to pay back to the owner every penny that was already paid him. This law applies even if the unlicensed contractor completes the job and even if the work performed is otherwise perfect.\n\nWhether you should sue is really a business decision. It is unlikely you would be able to collect your judgment, and it seems you are happy with the work which was performed.",
        "Legally, you have no obligation to pay an unlicensed contractor any money for a job over $500. And, in fact, even if he finished the job and you loved it, you would not have to pay him and you could even sue him for all your money back. What is moral is a different story, and is up to you to decide. For me (since he did a good job) it would come down to whether he did half the work (and did it well) since you already paid him for half. If he did, then I would just let it go and find a licensed contractor to finish the job; but that is just me. You can do whatever you feel is right."

    "title": "I reported someone to the bankruptcy fraud department. How long does it usually take for an investigation.",
    "question": "So I’m tired of thi women always getting away with cheating the system. She has lied on her taxes, collected EDD while working, and now she has lied on her BK filing. It’s truly upsetting that people get away with so much. I understand that I won’t know if they are actually investigating but I showed that she lied in her 341 hearing. She told the trustee she pays $1,700 a month rent she only pays $500.She lives with her mother and pays her $500 a month. She filed 11/2019, I sent documents to the trustee to show that she only pay s $500 a month rent, statements and court docs from another case. In September 2020 she amended her docs to say she paid $500 from November- March (yet at her 341 hearing under oath she said she pays $1700) she of course lied on the amended docs in September because she still only pays $500 and I submitted proof to the fraud investigation unit and the trustee. On 11/12/2020 the trustee submitted a report of no distribution of assets. The case is still not closed. The documents I submitted shows proof she lied at her 341 under oath. She has a net disposable income of $1,300.00. What is the like outcome. Will she get away with it because it’s not a large $?",

        "I suspect that the US Trustee or the US Attorney may be investigating this matter, usually Ch7 cases close in a matter of a few months and if the case is still open more than a year after filing, that is unusual, even if the case trustee has filed a report of no distribution. The report of no distribution just means the trustee has not found any significant assets to liquidate, it does not mean that no further investigation of the debtor's truthfulness is going on.",

        "Trustee ONLY gets $60 a case in no asset cases so frankly he is not the one to pursue. However, you said case is not closed. It is possible the US Trustee's office is looking into this area in that case. You can always call and ask to see what they can tell you or see if they saw what you provided. Good luck and thanks for asking here on AVVO too. You can call periodically to court to see if anything is filed too."

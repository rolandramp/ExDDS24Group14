    "title": "What steps do I take if my Bankrupcy lawyer was disbarred?",
    "question": "Upon filing bankruptcy, I payed a Lawyer $2,500.00. He was shortly thereafter 'disbarred'. Can I get my money back?",
    "answers": [
        "We've all also neglected to mention that this attorney may have malpractice insurance that you could go after.",
        "You may be able to sue him or get the bankruptcy court to order that he pay you back some money. Then you would have to collect and that is where you would have a hard time. If he did the paperwork correct, then you only need to attend your meeting of creditors so you would not likely get much back anyway.\n\nThe problem you may have at the meeting of creditors is that the Trustee does not usually let you represent yourself when you have an attorney. You would need to file a substitution of attorney to replace the attorney with yourself.",
        "You may be out of luck. But here a couple ideas:\n\nIf the lawyer took the money from you knowing that he was about to be disbarred he probably committed criminal fraud. If that is the case and if the district attorney prosecutes, the lawyer might be ordered to pay you restitution as part of his sentence. You would need to be in communication with the DA to make this happen.\n\nAlso if the lawyer took the money from you by fraud you can sue him and he can't discharge the debt to you in bankruptcy.",
        "Check with the California state bar, which may have a fund to defray losses clients incur when lawyers steal trust funds or otherwise damage their clients."

    "title": "I have lien judgements placed on my home back in sept 2010 and november 2011. I filed bankruptcy and it was discharged in 2012.",
    "question": "I found out i had 5 liens on my home when I tried to refinance my home. Do these liens expire after 10 years? One of the company's that placed the lien does not exist anymore. What are my options, and what is the best option? Should i reopen the BK to have the liens removed by an attorney, or should I wait for the liens to expire? What are the chances that the creditors will extend the liens? It will be 10 years in 2020 and 2021 that these judgements were placed. What is the best decision to make to move forward?",
    "answers": [
        "The liens do expire in 10 yrs from when they were recorded. However, it is possible for a creditor to renew the lien. Your best option is to try and reopen the case and move to avoid the liens.",
        "I have represented many people in your situation. Under 11 USC 350(a), the bankruptcy you had can be reopened to afford relief. If your real property was exempt at the time of the filing of the Petition in your bankruptcy, the liens may be avoided (not stripped) under 11 USC 522(f)(1) IF they were \"judgment liens\". Voluntary liens (those that you gave to a creditor to get a loan), tax liens and certain other liens cannot be avoided.\n\nYou need to get to an experienced bankruptcy attorney right now and have a consultation. The fees for this type of action can vary widely, and there will be a new filing fee if they recommend that the case be reopened and that motions be filed to avoid the liens.\n\nIf you have substantial equity now and if the liens are in larger amounts, you can gain tremendously by avoiding the liens.",
        "Assuming the liens are avoidable now (no equity over and above your homestead exemption at the time), then they will be avoidable after they are renewed as well. You might as well wait, at this point, to see which ones renew.",
        "You ask questions that it takes a crystal ball to answer. A lot depends on who the creditors are. You need to consult with a lawyer. I have seen some creditors pull the lien for free, I've seen some creditors pull the lien for $1000. I've seen some creditors sell the liens to bottom feeder debt collectors, and I've seen some creditors let the lien expire.",
        "My advice is the same as yesterday. Go hire an attorney, maybe even your original attorney, and get the liens stripped. You are asking a n unanswerable question. You want to hear that you can do nothing. How could an attorney suggest that? You are trying to refi, and you have the liens. Are you willing to wait, only to have the liens renewed again? Get rid of the problem once and for all. I f you don;t like the price of one attorney, ask another. It is somewhat extensive work, so get the abstracts of judgment printed out to save the time and effort an attorney has to put into it. Perhaps that will save some coin.",

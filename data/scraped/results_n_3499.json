    "title": "Discharged Chapter 7. Lender wont pick up my surrendered vehicle. In Calif.",
    "question": "My Ch. 7 was recently discharged. We opted to surrender the car and that is in our filings. Our BK attorney sent notice to lender to pick up the vehicle and we also sent a certified letter asking them to pick it up or give us title to it. It needs MAJOR mechanical work which we included in our letter. If i have to fix it, im keeping it. Tags are due soon so i need the lender to either pick it up or give me the title so i have the right to fix it, sale it or donate it. Its sitting in my driveway taking up space.",

        "Another option is to talk to your attorney about the possibility of doing a redemption on the vehicle. If it has \"some\" value, you could offer to redeem it for a nominal amount, say $1.00. Then, the lender will be required to either contest the redemption and say it is worth more or take $1.00 for it. If the lender contests redemption, they will probably be willing to pick it up. If they don't contest redemption, then you get the vehicle for payment of $1.00. But, of course, a motion to redeem is necessary and that will require additional attorney fees.",

        "Nothing. Unless you voluntarily pay the debt, they can repossess the vehicle. You have complied with the law by offering to turn over the vehicle.

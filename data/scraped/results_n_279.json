    "title": "Can CH11 business bankruptcy protect my personal assets when the landlords and SBA have a personal guarantee with me?",
    "question": "I own two retail stores that are getting crushed by COVID-19 lockdowns. I have personal guarantees with the landlords and SBA loan so I realize I’m probably screwed. I know most here will say to contact and attorney but that’s just not possible now. I’m just hoping for some piece of mind before entering this hell I’m about to walk into.",
    "answers": [
        "The personal guarantee means that you are personally responsible for the debt, so a business bankruptcy will not discharge those debts. In a personal bankruptcy you can discharge those debts, but if you have significant assets, you will be required to make payments to creditors. If your business has been impacted by the pandemic, that is probably not possible at this point. You may have to wait to see what your landlords and lenders do, and then discuss your options with a bankruptcy attorney. Don't assume that you cannot afford an attorney until after you have made contact with a few.",
        "Seek professional counsel. There are many factors which help a professional determine how a bankruptcy will affect the individual personally (and thereby any personal guarantees). It’s important for a consultation to know whether the business is operating under the umbrella of a corporation, LLC, GP, LP, etc. and what the balance sheet looks like for the individual and the business. It’s best not to self assess but rather seek competent counsel that will guide you.",
        "Contact with an attorney asap to evaluate your options.\nYou may need to file personal bankruptcy yourself.",
        "As you have personally guaranteed the SBA loans, you and your personal assets are a recourse for the loan holders. You may not be \"screwed\" and should talk to an attorney or your chapter 11 attorney if you are currently in Chapter 11.",
        "I agree with the above answer from Fred Isquith. I'll add that I've had multiple clients for a personal bankruptcy because of their guarantees of business debts. Also, I'm not clear what you mean by \"contact an attorney but that’s just not possible now\". I'm certainly open for business (remotely) and I assume many others are also.",
        "There is no peace of mind here to be given. Business bankruptcy does not deal with a personal guarantee"

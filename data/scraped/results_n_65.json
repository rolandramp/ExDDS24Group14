        "Answer already submitted provides good information for you. I urge you to discuss the matter with your bankruptcy attorney. If you filed your chapter 13 without an attorney, I urge you to consult with an experienced bankruptcy attorney regarding this matter.",
        "There are a couple of factors that would need to be addressed. The first, is whether the lien was consensual or non-consensual. Secondly, does the lien impair an exemption to which you are entitled? A consensual lien is a lien that you consented to and therefore would remain on the property. A non-consensual lien is one that you did not agree to and the creditor forced upon the property maybe by way of an Abstract of Judgment or some other means. Consulting with a bankruptcy attorney will help you to determine if the lien can be removed."

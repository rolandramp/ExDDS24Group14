    "question": "i have previous credit card debt around 60k. I have a judgment against me. Just launched a company. I am considering consolidating debt in the next 6 months. In the mean time i dont want any money garnished. I am wondering if i can temporarily have a dba in my family members name and at the end of year once monies are available i can pay the creditors. Is it possible once a dba is set up with bank that it can be transfered into my name. I would prefer to do dba in my name with ein number. I dont think that will shield me from previous debt.",

However, I disagree with my colleagues that you should avoid this scheme at all costs. If you manage it properly, it could work.

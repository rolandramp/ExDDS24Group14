    "title": "Can I stop the original creditor from harassing my client by sending out a Letter of Representation?",
    "question": "I am representing a client who has various debts. I had sent out a Letter of Representation to the original creditor asking them to have all calls routed to my office. Now, four months later, the client is still receiving calls from the original creditor. I also made a courtesy call to the original creditor and they still continue to call my client.",

        "You can file a lawsuit in state court or federal court under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and/or the RFDCPA, get you client the statutory penalty of $1,000 per violation and collect your attorney's fees.",
        "Your client may have claims under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and Rosenthal Act. These laws prohibit collectors from contacting parties the collectors know to be represented by counsel. You should contact an attorney who practices in these areas in order to further evaluate potential claims against both the creditor and collection agencies.\n\nIn the mean time, your client can advise the collection agency that they are represented by an attorney (assuming you are an attorney) and provide your contact information. Alternatively, you can contact the collection agency on behalf of your client and advise them of your representation (again, assuming you are an attorney).\n\nAlso, be sure to document every contact with the collection agency - keep a call log (date, time, number called, number called from, account number, who you spoke with, what was said, etc.) and keep copies of all correspondence.",
        "If you have notified the creditor that you are representing the debtor, they are violating the law by continuing to contact your client. This is an actionable offense of the FDCPA and Rosenthal Act. You may want to use this as leverage to negotiate a settlement.",
        "If the original creditor is a debt collector, the purpose of their contact is to collect on the debt and you have informed them that you now represent the client, these calls are violations of the FDCPA and Rosenthal acts. You have an actionable claim at this point, although, proof of their violation with phone logs or call history may be difficult. But filing suit is an option.",
        "While a debt collector would be liable under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act for contacting a consumer known to be represented (assuming these are consumer, not business, debts) I don't know about the original creditor being prohibited. You have a consumer protection statute (Rosenthal Act) which may provide some help."

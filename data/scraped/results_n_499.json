    "title": "I was in an at fault accident and the plaintiff is sueing exceeding my policy.",
    "question": "I was in an accident over a year ago and found out that my insurance is refusing to pay out the other driver who i was in an accident with. They are telling me that the plaintiffs attourney is trying to milk them for maximum policy amount and they refusing to do that because I was at fault. Is that legal for insurance companies to do that knowing that the plaintiff can come for me? Also i don’t own any assets, a car, a home, or let alone a bank account, no job , unemployed pretty much $40 to my name... do i tell the plaintiffs attourney that I’m going to be homeless soon anyways and that i will just file Bankruptcy anyways? Will that make them happy to pursue this? Like how will they get money.",

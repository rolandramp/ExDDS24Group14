        "Atty Heston has accurately explained the legal and practical options available. What do you believe is the value of the contents in storage? How much is owed for the storage fees?",
        "I am very sorry to hear of your health problems and I hope that your recovery is complete. You failed to mention how much is owing to the storage unit operator or when the auction is scheduled to take place. If there is no dispute with regard to the fact that storage fees are owed, and you have a contract that permits the operator to auction the contents in the event of default in payment, a bankruptcy proceeding would prevent the auction from going forward, but it may very well be that the cost of filing the bankruptcy, i.e., $335 for a Chapter 7 and $310 for a Chapter 13, together with attorney fees or preparing an emergency petition, might very well be more expensive than simply paying the storage unit fees. Even if you attempt to avoid the cost of attorneys fees by filing the bankruptcy yourself, it sounds as if you are in no condition to be running around dealing with these issues and only an attorney can appear in court and file papers on someone else's behalf. You may want to contact the public loss to her or one of the other nonprofit legal service providers in Los Angeles County to seek assistance. Alternatively, you may wish to reach out to friends and family for a short term loan to cover the storage unit fees"

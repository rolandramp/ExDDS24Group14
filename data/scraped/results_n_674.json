        "There are several issues to go over with an experienced bankruptcy attorney. 1) As long as you are married you are limited to the \"standard exemptions\" rather than the \"wild card exemptions\" unless your wife agrees or files with you which sounds unlikely. This may not be a problem or it can be a real problem in filing bankruptcy. 2) If you or your spouse are contemplating divorce, it is vital that you meet with a bankruptcy attorney BEFORE you do a marital settlement agreement or have an order that you pay any particular debt. If the order happens before you file a bankruptcy, you may be stuck \"indemnifying\" your spouse if she pays a debt you were ordered to pay. That is not true if you file bankruptcy before a family law court makes such an order the bankruptcy keeps the court from doing such an order. 3) If you file a bankruptcy, you may get to choose which assets are exempt (protected) and which are not exempted. 4) There are major differences as to how you are treated under the \"means test\" depending on whether you are separated and physically living apart. The same is true about whether a divorce proceeding has been started. 5) Filing bankruptcy will include all of your assets AND all community property including her half. 6) Your situation is very dependant on how long you have been married, if you or your spouse owns a house, and so much more. that this only scratches the surface.\n\nDo yourself a huge favor and see a quality bankruptcy attorney to find out what can be done for you and what is protected. Your case would be filed in the Bankruptcy Court in Sacramento. I would recommend you find a quality bankruptcy attorney by looking at Avvo's ratings for Sacramento attorneys.\n\nYou could also look at the CA State bar website for a Certified Bankruptcy Law Specialist in Sacramento. I have provided a link to the state bar below. You may have to \"cut and paste\" it into your search bar.\n\nAnother potential source for finding a good attorney would be through a search of the National Association of Consumer Bankruptcy Attorneys (NACBA.org) to find a good local attorney. Again, I have provided a link below. Again you may have to \"cut and paste.\"\n\nMost attorneys will give you are free initial consultation.\n\nNo matter how good an attorney is rated, if you are not comfortable with the attorney when you meet, move on to another attorney. Also, if the attorney uses a paralegal to do the initial appointment, move on because you are just a number and a dollar sign. If this is how you are treated when they are trying to get your money, you can be certain it is not going to get better after they get your money.\n\nDo NOT use an attorney that does anything other than bankruptcy and consumer law and/or foreclosure law. Part-time bankruptcy attorneys are, sadly, almost never expert enough to do the job right. This is a specialized field and you should go with an attorney who practices solely in that specialty. Never hire to veterinarian's assistant to do brain surgery on you and never hire a non-specialist to do a specialists job. Get the right attorney to begin with.\n\nChoose based on skill rather than price. A bad attorney will cost you way more in the long run.\n\nI hope this helps you.\nCalifornia State Bar Certified Specialist Search\nhttp://members.calbar.ca.gov/search/ls_search.aspx\n\nNational Association of Consumer Bankruptcy Attorneys\nhttp://network.nacba.org/advanced-search",

        "If the money was given to you with some expectation of repayment in the future, then it's a loan. You would need to disclose that on your schedule F. If the money was given to you with no expectation of repayment whatsoever, then it's a gift. You wouldn't need to list it as a loan, but it could be considered income you might need to disclose, depending on when it was received and whether the amounts were received with any regularity."

    "title": "Can a judgement be renewed 2 or more times in California?",
    "question": "I have had an abstract judgement for 20 years and it was recently recorded as a renewal for another 10. It was for an unsecured auto loan and they got more money for the car than I owed.",
    "answers": [
        "A judgment may be renewed once for a second ten year period. See Cal. Code of Civil Procedure Sec. 683.110. Thus, the most a Cal. judgment may last is 20 years, if all papers were filed properly. See CCP Sec. 683.130. This extends enforceability of any judgment liens, but the lien may not survive past the 20 year maximum of the underlying judgment. See CCP Secs. 683.180 - 683.210.\n\nIf a debt collector is telling you that they can have a lien on your property after the 20 year period expires, that is false and a false statement about the status of the judgment may be a violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. You may need an attorney to help you correct any errors that have been filed with the county recorder's office or the court. Don't delay, as correcting such errors often requires that you act promptly upon learning of the mistake and there are statutes of limitation on any claims for debt collection harassment or abuse."

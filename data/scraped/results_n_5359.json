    "title": "Should I settle with cashcall before they try to serve me? Or is it too late? They don't know where I live.",
    "question": "I had a cashcall loan that I have defaulted on. I received letters to settle but I ignored them. Today my mom was approached by a gentleman asking for me but my mom told him I don't live there any more (which I don't). I am getting a little nervous that eventually they will find out where I live and serve me. Should I try to settle with them? Is it too late to settle? Will I owe attorneys' fees at this point ( I am sure they have their own legal department)? What should I do??",

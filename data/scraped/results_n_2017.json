    "title": "QDRO and Contempt",
    "question": "Got divorced in 2010. Ex would not sign MSA, judge had to after months of trying. No details about QDRO in final judgment other than to divide according to community property law. No MSA just a transcript of the hearing and a one page summary of transcript. Ex wants QDRO done but I want to split the debt we have and have her sign off on a portion of retirement account to settle debt. Is it contempt if I don't go along with this?",

        "I agree with my colleagues hire an attorney to wrap this up correctly. I would add more but you seem to know what to do with the advice that was given to you. Best of luck.",
        "This is an example as to why family law attorneys need to be brought into a divorce with complicated property issues. First, there won't be an MSA if the divorce went to trial and a court entered a judgment. What should have been done was that one of the parties should have prepared a formal judgment for the court to sign. And, the judgment, containing a general order on the divisionof the QDRO should have been followed with up with a probably a joinder and/or the submission of a formal QDRO on the pension plan. As to wanting to do what you say, you have a problem in that an actual judgment was entered and now you want to alter that judgment. The post though begs another question, Why wasn't the debt included in the judgment? It isn't contempt if you don't go along with this but you are getting close to it. You need an attorney.",
        "Your question is confusing. The contempt remedy is not available because one side doesn't like the deal - it is only for cases where there is a direct violation of a court order.\n\nYou need some legal advice. Were the debts not handled in the judgment?"

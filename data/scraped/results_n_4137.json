    "title": "Is it legal to garnish my wages for debt to the Navy Exchange -seller of goods- without a me having notice of it?",
    "question": "I just saw that my husbands wages were garnished $300 for a credit line debt we had with the Navy Exchange (where they sell goods tax free). I though that you could only automatically garnish with IRS and child support? We had no notice that they were going to do this and did not get any court hearings about this. We just discovered it on our paycheck. Can they do this? If not, what is our relief? Please help.",

        "As noted, a judgment is necessary for such matters before a garnishment can be issued. Speak with a local attorney who can review the court docket and see if there is a basis for vacating the judgment.",
        "It is illegal in all states to garnish wages without giving the garnishee notice. Of course, it is possible for you not to receive the notice allowed by the State. I frequently have clients tell me they are being garnished, but that they never got notice. In every case I have found in the court's file documents showing that my clients were served properly under the law. This does not meant that they were actually served, just that someone filed a document saying they did everything properly. You should discuss this matter with an attorney. Ask the attorney to look at your state file.",
        "To garnish your wages without your permission the creditor would have had to first sue you and obtained a judgment, and then obtained an earnings withholding order, and then served the earnings withholding order on both you and your employer. All of these actions require notice to you. Your husband needs to discuss this with his employer immediately. If you were not served properly you can file a motion to vacate the judgment against you, but then you will still need to deal with the underlying lawsuit and whatever debt was owed.",
        "The Navy Exchange is an instrumentality of the USG which leads me to believe the garnishment is valid. Ask your husband's employer for the garnishment order because your employer cannot withhold from your wages without authorization. Let me know what you find out."

        "In addition to unemployment benefits, you may have a host of wage and hour claims against your employer. If you are compelled to quit due to your employer's repeated failure to comply with the state wage and hour laws, then you may also have a claim for wrongful constructive discharge in violation of public policies. One issue you should carefully scrutinize before bringing any claim against your employer is whether your employer is financially solvent. If your employer is operating as a sole proprietor, then he is personally liable for the debts of the business. If he is solvent but failing to pay you compensation to which you are entitled, you can pursue claims against him as an individual defendant. If he is operating as a corporation (or other limited liability entity), then you can, of course, bring claims against the business form. If, say, the business form is a corporation and its shareholder—i.e., the gentleman for whom you work—does not really operate it like one (e.g., he underfunds it, he commingles the assets of the corporation with his own, he fails to observe corporate formalities, etc.), then you still may be able to reach him personally (using a legal theory known as “piercing the corporate veil”).\n\nIf your wage and hour claims are substantial, you should consult with an employment attorney right away. Otherwise, you also have the option of filing an unpaid wage claim with the Labor Commissioner or bringing a small claims action (assuming your damages are less than $10,000). Good luck.",

        "Yes, you should still be entitled to receive unemployment insurance benefits under such a scenario.

However, if one reason which is good cause is a substantial motivating factor in causing the claimant to leave work, the claimant's leaving is with good cause."

        "No. Request for time to hire attorney to defend wage garnishment is not within exceptons to Covid-19 restrictions on access to court.",
        "Generally speaking, once a debtor is put on notice of a wage garnishment, they have a statutory time period to file a claim of exemption. Once they file a claim of exemption, the Court must have a hearing before the money can be released. In this case, because the courts are temporarily closed to the public, your hearing will not be for many months and the money will be held pending that time period. Goodluck."

    "title": "Am I legally responsible for hidden debt incurred by my husband?",
    "question": "I am married for 9 years & live in California. I just found out my husband has incurred a large debt without my knowledge. We were unaware that they served papers on him. His name was attached to his mom's banking accounts & they garnished all her money even though it wasn't his money. I have bank accounts in both maiden & married names, but do not have his name on either of them. I own a house which I bought before we got married and have never added his name or changed my name on the papers/records. My house is homesteaded. Will the creditors be able to come after my house or my bank accounts? Am I still legally obligated if I start proceedings with a divorce (am I responsible for his hidden debts)?",

        "It depends in part on HOW and WHEN your husband incurred those debts, and WHAT the debts were for. If he incurred debts to pay your and his other joint bills, for example, you may well be liable for those debts; if he did something of which you were complertely unaware, and from which you received no benefit during the marriage, you might not have liability on those debts.\n\nI'd at least consult with an attorney to make sure you take the best available steps to protect your rights and assets."

    "title": "Can a collection agency sue you for a student loan that was written off by the original creditor?",
    "question": "JP Morgan Chase wrote off my student loans last year and I had to include it as income for my 2013 tax returns. I received a letter stating that those student loans have been written off. Now all of the sudden I got a court order from some collection agency who are suing me for those same loans. Is that possible and legal? It doesn't make any sense, if the wrote it off and I have to pay taxes on it, how come I owe it to a collection agency?",

        "I am going to take a different path than my collegues did. I assume you received an IRS 1099c form, and that is what required you to include the amount with your taxable income. If so, I believe the debt was legally forgiven. Personally, I think the bank goofed, and that your loan was really intended to be turned over to collections, and was not supposed to be forgiven. But, the action taken by the bank is final as far as I am concerned. Especially since it was reported to the IRS as income and you included that as income on your tax return.\n\nI suggest you find an attorney who will write a nice \"lawyer letter\" on your behalf to the collection agency. Don't delay. You may lose valuable legal rights by failing to contest this right away with the collection agency.",
        "I also agree they sure can sue you. But remember a private student loan is no different from any credit card debt. You defend against these debts just like you would against any other debt. It may be almost impossible to discharge the debt in bankruptcy but there are defenses. If you pay this debt then you may be able to deduct it just like you included it in income for the prior year. You have the ability to sue the debt collector under FDCPA for any violation of that act. Also these private student loans are much much easier to discharge in a bankruptcy or pay off in a Chapter 13.",
        "Mr Berkus nailed it-- but I am going to place this under debt settlement as that's the better category for you.",
        "Yes. A \"wrote off\" loan is not a discharge or forgiveness of the loan. All it means is JP Morgan Chase, for accounting, tax, SEC, banking regulations, etc.; had to show the debt as a bad debt on its books. That ALL \"write off\" means.\n\nYou said you paid taxes on the write off? That issue is more complicated. First, I assume that means you were issued a 1099-C. It gets tricky at that point. Because there are circumstances where a 1099-C can be issued and the debt still owed. (too long to explain here).\n\nYou need to hire an experienced debt defense attorney (there are plenty in CA). The 1099-C issue may be one defense, but there could be others.\n\nThe bare answer to your question is not as straight forward as you would hope."

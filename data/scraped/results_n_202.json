    "title": "If I know someone has lied on their bankruptcy filing and I call their lawyer do they have to question their client?",
    "question": "If I provide the attorney on record with information that their client has omitted a creditor (thatâ€™s she continues to pay, even though this debt was pre-petitioned debt) from their bankruptcy and lied about how much she pays in rent and I can send proof to the attorney, is the attorney obligated to do anything with this information? I know I can send this information directly to the trustees fraud department but want to know what would happen if I informed the attorney on record. Thanks",

        "I agree with the opinions above. You may want to consider telling the attorney about the information as well as the US Trustee and panel trustee. These seem like items that the debtor's attorney could fix with and amendment to the petition and schedules. Unless the rent is greatly understated on the schedules, there may not have been any fraudulent intent here.",
        "You should contact the chapter 7 trustee.",
        "I agree with the prior attorneys, except I will also add that the attorney also owes a duty of candor to the court. Also, the debtor signs a declaration that they have reviewed the schedules and that they are accurate. So if the attorney is presented with proof that the schedules are now inaccurate (allegedly) then he must likely confer with his client, and then if necessary, amend the schedules and make sure the trustee knows. Inaccuracies are not necessarily lies.",
        "Attorney Heston has given you correct advice. If you have information that the debtor has been untruthful and disclosing either the extent of their debts or the extent of their assets you should bring this information to the attention of the United States trustee. Or you may bring it to the attention of the trustee assigned to the case . Thank you for your interest in the integrity of the system",
        "The debtor's attorney owes the duty of loyalty to the client, not you. If you feel that you have information of this nature, you would be wise to share it with the appointed trustee or the office of the United States Trustee.\n\nYou should not expect or insist on an attorney breaching his or her duty of loyalty to the client by putting him or her into a position of conflict. At most, an attorney who has been made aware of information of such a nature would do no more than seek to withdraw from representation.\n\nIf you expect the information to be helpful to your position, you need to put it into the hands of those who owe no duty of confidentiality or loyalty to the debtor."

    "question": "I owe about 10,000 in credit card debt, most of which is about to drop off in the next year or two. I just got a job working for the state of California. Can they garnish my wages ? if I open a bank account and have direct deposit set up and start putting all my money into that account, can these collection agencys take money from my bank account? I do not owe the IRS any money. once again this is all credit card debt. I'm trying to decide wether or not to try and settle with them for a lower amount and ask them to put in writing that they cant take any money from me if I agree to pay x amount every month...any expertise would be greatly appreciated!!!!",

        "If the creditor has not filed a lawsuit and obtained a judgment (after your default or after a trial), the creditor cannot levy on your bank account nor can the creditor garnish your wages.

(Called a \"banker's setoff.\") Do not give the collector direct access to your bank account. I advise against entering into any sort of payment plan. That would re-start the Statute of Limitations. You can save up some money and then offer a lump sum about of a fraction of the amount of their claim. If it has been more than four years since the account went into default, you may have a Statute of Limitations defense if the creditor files a lawsuit. Lastly, do not believe anything that a debt collector tells you, especially if it pertains to your legal rights.",
        "I agree with the above posters in regards to a creditor not being able to garnish your wages absent a valid judgment.

        "I recommend depositing at a credit union. Data about their customers usually isn't available for sale to collection law firms. Consider getting a free case evaluation to look for illegal collection tactics and YOU may be entitled to compensation!",

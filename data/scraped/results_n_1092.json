    "question": "I'm a creditor in a bankruptcy case chapter 13. The debtor is involved in a criminal case with the police and the DA office. The criminal case is still not closed.",

        "Yes- I have had clients who file bankruptcy while in the middle of criminal proceedings but one has to tread very carefully especially if any possible victims could be viewed as creditors.",
        "A pending criminal case should present no obstacle to that Defendant if her or she decided to file a bankruptcy petition.",
        "Yes, a bankruptcy can be filed while a criminal case is being investigated or pending. Even a conviction doesn't stop a bankruptcy from being filed. I have filed many cases where either the husband or wife of a couple was incarcerated during or before the case was filed.\n\nThe criminal case is not stayed by the filing and can continue in the court where it is pending.\n\nIf restitution is ordered, the restitution is not discharged by the bankruptcy. Fines and other penalties are also not discharged in most situations.",
        "Yes, the person can file bankruptcy. However, it may be very difficult to make chapter 13 plan payments if the outcome of the criminal charges result in the person's inability to work.",
        "As noted by the prior counsel, there is nothing in the Bankruptcy Code that prevents a debtor who is in a pending criminal matter from filing bankruptcy. The Code addresses criminal proceedings in several sections including making criminal fines and restitution not dischargable and providing that the automatic stay does not apply to criminal actions.\nIf your claim against this debtor arose from the alleged criminal activity and the debtor has not yet been convicted of it, it would be wise to seek your own counsel to see if you need to file an action in the bankruptcy court to have the debt declared non-dischargable. Criminal liability requires a greater level of proof than civil/bankruptcy liability, so it would be wise to cover all of your bases.",
        "You are not telling me anything exciting enough to allow me to offer you much to comment on. I am the lawyer that represents convicted criminals who have just gotten out of the joint and file Chapter 13 to allow the convict to get a fresh start and move on with their life. In Chapter 13, you file a proof of claim and hope to get paid. You can object to the plan if it fails to provide for full payment of a debt relating to damages due to a criminal offense. Hope this perspective helps!",
        "There is NO exception in the bankruptcy Code for a person to file bankruptcy for persons CHARGED or COMMITTED a crime. But there are exceptions to a ch 7 bankruptcy for discharge of specific debts if someone committed an act that is listed as an exception to the bankruptcy code in section 11 USC 523. Thus, if any of those exist, you can still file an adversary lawsuit against a debtor to prove an exception applies. Who knows if you are throwing good money after bad! Speak to an experienced bankruptcy attorney if you desire after they have filed such a bankruptcy as you must file such suit before the deadline listed in any notice from the court! Good luck.PS just because someone is charged does not mean they committed it (you may know they did possibly) ; but not an exception to file.",
        "Yes he could file bankruptcy if he were in jail, for that matter. If you are concerned about your rights as a creditor, you can consult with a creditors rights attorney. There are grounds in the bankruptcy code for objecting to a discharge as to your specific debt."

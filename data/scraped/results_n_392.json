    "title": "Can I remove an old property lien?",
    "question": "I have an 8-year-old credit card judgment lien on my property. I am considering filing chapter 7. Can I request the court to remove this old lien and include it in my Chapter 7? if so, what are the chances the court will remove this old lien and include it in the bankruptcy? is there a general time limit or statute of limitations to remove an old judgment lien on a property? Thank you",

        "I agree with my colleagues. In order to remove the lien in a chapter 7 you will need to file a separate motion within your chapter 7 case and show that the judgment lien imposes on your homestead exemption. Essentially, the equity in your property cannot be more than your homestead exemption. I would highly recommend speaking with some experienced attorneys about this and retaining one to handle your filing and this motion as there are a lot of nuanced requirements.",
        "There is a process for removing judgment liens from real property title. It requires that you can prove that the lien prevents you from claiming your entire homestead exemption.\n\nI strongly suggest that you seek a consultation from a local attorney to discuss your specific situation. Whether you can strip the lien is specific to your personal situation which is hard for us to discuss in this forum.\n\nGood luck.",
        "The answer is probably, but there has to be exempted equity in the house that the lien impinges. Motions to avoid a lien are complicated and are rarely successful without the help of an experienced bankruptcy attorney. Expect to pay an additional legal fee over a basic bankruptcy fee. See an attorney for details."

    "title": "How long do I have to hold on to collateral for repayment of a debt?",
    "question": "An aquaintance owes me $1,200. She is unemployed & has been unable to pay me, so she gave me as collateral a necklace & earrings that she said costs $2,500. However, she refuses to give me the paperwork (ie: receipt & authenticity certificate), as she truly does not want me to sell it because of sentimental value. And because of that, I truly do not want to sell it, as she WAS a very dear friend of mine. But I desperately need the money that she owes me in order to help save my home. What is the customary & legal amount of time I should hold the jewelry before selling it?",

        "The custom is to have a written agreement which states the terms under which you may sell the collateral, when the borrower breaches the repayment terms. There is no ordinary or customary between friends and while pawn shops may have standard terms, the terms are clearly express in documentation provided to the customer.\n\nAlso, the custom is to give the collateral holder enough documents so that they could sell the collateral, but without the certificate of authenticity, you will not realize the full amount these items are worth and some companies will not buy unless they have some sort of assurance that it was not stolen.\n\nYour best bet is to sue the lady for the amount she owes you in small claims court and get a judgment then enforce the judgment using whatever means available, but the court may grant you an order to sell the jewelery, once you have an unsatisfied judgment."

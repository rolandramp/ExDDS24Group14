        "First, read the notice. It may say they intend to go to court to have the judge decide the objection. If it came from the trustee, I recommend calling them since they are administering your case anyway. If they are successful objecting to an exemption, they are trying to recover money for your creditors so this could cost you. It never hurts to contact the other side, even if they are not the trustee, and get an idea what they are claiming and if it's possible for you to settle or talk them out of their objection.",
        "Do you mean an objection based upon an exemption or a response to claim of exemption? There are forms on the courts website for exemptions claims but there should not be a response or an objection to an exemption claim because either there is an exemption or not. The court really doesn't have much discretion."

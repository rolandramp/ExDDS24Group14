        "If the Judgment creditor knew of the check, it is possible that a levy could be done agaisnt the physical check. I do not believe that a garnishment of the bank would reach the cashier's check. The judgment debtor could acomplish the same end by withdrawing the money in cash. If you are the judgment debtor you should consult an attorney about your options to deal with the debt such as filing bankruptcy or setting up a payment plan.",
        "It sounds like you may have a creditor that you are looking to protect your assets from. Bankruptcy has a series of exemptions that help protect assets under the right circumstances. One of the exemptions is know as a \"wild card\". Once a case has been filed, this can be used to protect about $24,000 of any property, including cashiers checks."

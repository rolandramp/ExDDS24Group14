    "title": "What exactly is a tentative ruling?",
    "question": "September of 2010, I received a summons. I was being sued by a CC company for unpaid debt. I filed an answer and hearing was set for today, June 17th. When I went to sign in with the bailiff, she said it had been dropped from the court calendar and to go outside and read the tentative rulings. Mine indicated: COMPLAINT DISMISSED on March 4, 2011. That was over 3 months ago. I never received this information. Does this mean that the CC company and/or their attorneys decided to drop the complaint or was it the judges ruling? Can this same company attempt to sue me again? Many thanks! It did not indicate \"with prejudice\" or \"without prejudice.\" I am a bit confused and simply want to be clear on the matter.",

        "In connection with \"law and motion\" matters, many judges will prepare a tentative ruling (and sometimes post their tentative rulings on the court's website). Not every judge prepares a tentative ruling. In some cases, you can call the court clerk to ask if there is a tentative ruling the day before the hearing. Other judges may prepare a tentative, and make it available in the courtroom on the morning of the hearing. A handful of judges prepare a tentative ruling and fax it to the parties before the hearing.\n\nParties often submit on the tentative if they wish to waive oral argument and are otherwise satisfied with the tentative ruling. It is allowable, although not necessarily common because usually one of the parties will want to make oral argument and/or ask questions and/or ask for clarification. However, as a general rule, if the court has prepared a tentative ruling, the judge will not likely change his or her mind.\n\nI am not sure what \"hearing\" was set for today. Perhaps it was an OSC? In any event, it means either the court dismissed the entire case for failure to prosecute or dismissed the case pursuant to plaintiff's request. Unless there is a Request for Dismissal in the court file, it could be either scenario.",
        "Some debt collection law firm have only one interest in mind: enforcing a default judgment or getting you to call them to settle without having to enforce a judgment. Instead, you appeared with papers filed in court, so they decided to dismiss the case. It is highly likely that it was without prejudice, which means that you have won this round, but that the debt will probably be sold to yet another debt buyer entity, which may try to call you to get you to pay. I don't have enough information in your posting to know if they perceived some sort of defect in their lawsuit, such as being past the statute of limitations date.\n\nRobert Stempler (please see DISCLAIMER below)\nwww.StopCollectionLawsuits.com",
        "To control the volume of cases, judges will review cases ahead of hearings and make 'tentative rulings' on as many cases as they can. This will be the ruling of the court unless a party objects, usually files a document explaining why the ruling should be different. Since your case had been dismissed earlier, you should just monitor the file (if you want) and be thankful you didn't have to go through with the hearing. There are a number of reasons why the case was dismissed, but I would NOT contact the plaintiff's attorney. I would do nothing. \"With prejudice\" means the dismissal is final and no new case can be brought; \"without prejudice\" means they plaintiff can re-file."

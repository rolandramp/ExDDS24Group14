    "question": "We have fallen behind 6 mo on paying our credit cards. A lawyer advised us that we will have to file for Ch 7, to save our home, but that it would be good to delay the filing for (3-6) months, for some past transactions to fall outside of the “scrutiny period”.",

        "Its good that you spoke with a bankruptcy attorney. In order to save your home in bankruptcy, particularly if you are filing a Ch 7, you must look at the equity in your home. In this day and age, for many people its unlikely that you have equity. If no equity, or insufficient equity under Ch 7 standards, Ch 7 is appropriate IF you have kept the payments up on your home. If you are behind on your home payments or if you have a second mortgage that puts the equity in your home in a \"negative\" situation, you will need to consider Ch 13.\n\nIf you are behind only on your credit cards, then Ch 7 is appropriate.\n\nIf you have been served to appear for these past due credit card amounts, you could handle the response by yourself but you need be careful. Usually the court requires the first appearance for informal mediation; I don't suggest you come to an agreement, and yes, dispute it. That means then your case would have to be set for trial. That might be a few months or a few days. Every court is different.\n\nYou are not required to mention bankruptcy at any time, nor do I believe you should. Compare it to playing cards, do you tell your opponent what cards are in your hand? NO. Believe me, creditors in this day and age know that bankruptcy is ALWAYS an option, particularly if you have not filed in the past and your credit is already shot.\n\nThirty days start from the date of service. Make sure you follow it or a default judgment will be entered.\n\nIf you would like to discuss your bankruptcy or real estate issues, please call me at 941-641-7000. We have discounted programs available for people that want an attorney to prepare the petition, but do not believe they need to pay for an attorney to appear at the 341 hearing.\n\nDivina K. Westerfield",
        "I generally agree with my California colleague that the safest step is to file a general denial.\n\nHowever, another way to look at the lawsuit is that if you are absolutely certain you will filing for bankrutpcy protection in the next 60-90 days, why would you answer the complaint and spend the $355 court fee. It is unlikely a default judgment will be entered within that time frame and even more unlikely your wages would be garnished or a lien attached to your home. In any event, both events can be set aside by your bankruptcy attorney.\n\nYou have no obligation to tell anyone you are going to file bankruptcy. If it were me, I would not tell the credit card company because that may make them move quicker.\n\nOne question, how does your bankruptcy attorney believe you will be able to save your home in Chapter 7; usually Chapter 13 is used to save a home in arrears.\n\nGood luck!",
        "30 days to reply starts on date you were personally served. Best thing to do is to file a General Denial on court form PLD-050. That will give you enough time to then file bankruptcy before your lawsuit goes to trial.\n\nYou can do it yourself and buy more time. Don't have to mention BK. Just file it.\n\nThe response given is not intended to create, nor does it create an ongoing duty to respond to questions. The response does not form an attorney-client relationship, nor is it intended to be anything other than the educated opinion of the author. It should not be relied upon as legal advice. The response given is based upon the limited facts provided by the person asking the question. To the extent additional or different facts exist, the response might possibly change.

    "question": "My father died owing a medical debt to Mercy Hospital in Merced and the collector put an unjust lien on a home I purchased. I want to file bankruptcy on just this lien for $20,000.",
    "answers": [
        "First of all, it is not possible to file bankruptcy and include only the debt for the lien. All debts and all assets must be disclosed. Secondly, unless some important facts were omitted, (like a name mixup) it is not legally possible to get a judgment against person #1 and then file a lien against the house of person #2. Did you co-sign the hospital bill?. Thirdly, Avvo rules do not allow participating lawyers to conduct business, including their fees, on the website. You can click the Avvo tab \"Find a Lawyer\" and contact several until you find one you're comfortable with and they will quote you their fee. Good luck.",
        "1) No one can quote you a fee for a case without far more detailed information than can be provided here.\n\n2) You do not file bankruptcy \"on\" particular debts; you file bankruptcy. Any debt, owed to any person or entity, anywhere in the world, must be listed and disclosed. What may happen to any particular debt depends on the details of that particular debt, but all debts must be included.",
        "I'm confused why a lien would be on your house if the debt was owed by your father. If the house is not in his name and the debt was not yours, there shouldn't be a lien on your house. I suggest you contact a consumer protection attorney to discuss the details.",
        "I don't think any lawyer will post their fee. Try the Find a Lawyer link on every Avvo page. Enter bankruptcy attorney, phone or email a few, and you will have the data you seek."

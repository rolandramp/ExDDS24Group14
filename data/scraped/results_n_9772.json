        "Our firm does not practice family law, and we would be required to research to determine whether special rules apply to liens in favor of the state of California for child support. That being said: whether the lien attaches to Wife 2's interest could depend on a number of things. As I understand your posting, the lien was placed after the property was acquired by your ex and Wife 2, that is, the lien is junior to any mortgages which went on before the state lien was recorded in 1997. If title was acquired by ex and Wife 2 \"as community property\" the lien would attach to 100% of the value. If title was acquired in joint tenancy, there may be a factual issue as to whether the home was later transmuted to community property. In any case, if a foreclosure of a mortgage senior to the state lien is pending, completion of the foreclosure could destroy your lien without any \"equity\" i.e., money, going to you on account of the lien. Only competitive bidding at such a foreclosure sale could produce surplus funds which you and Wife 2 could argue about.\n\nGood luck,\n\nDean"

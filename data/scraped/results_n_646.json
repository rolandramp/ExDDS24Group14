    "title": "What can I do if a Default Judgment By Court - Before Trial has been filed against me?",
    "question": "I don't have the money to pay this large sum of $8000+. The legal documents indicate that the debt was sold twice and changed counsel once after the suit was filed. But the most recent letter was from an attorney who wasn't named in the disassociation of counsel. Do I have any recourse at this point?",
    "answers": [
        "The court has ruled and made a judgment against you. The creditor now has the right to garnish your wages, levy your bank account and maybe go against other assets, and put a lien on any real estate that you may own. Your recourse is to pay what you owe, offer a settlement to pay and maybe get a discount for cash, or perhaps to file bankruptcy.\n\nI want you to have a consultation with one or more bankruptcy lawyers. Not because bankruptcy is necessarily the answer, but because bankruptcy lawyers are experts at giving debt relief advice. Most BK lawyers will give you a free consultation. Your creditors all have legal advice, why shouldn't you have the same? Especially, when it is free.",
        "Consult with a local bankruptcy attorney as suggested. Once default is entered, creditor can seek to execute upon such to levy your assets."

    "title": "I am a co-borrower on a auto loan and making payments. If the co-signer files a BK, how does that affect me?",
    "question": "I am a co-borrower on a auto loan with a family member. The other borrower is going to file bankruptcy. I have the vehicle in my posession and have been making payments. The other borrwer is primary on the loan. How does this affect me? The BK lawyer is requesting proof of payments and declaration of the policy, copy of the contract, registration and proof of insurance. I don't want to give this information without knowing how this will affect me?",

        "The borrower filing bankruptcy must list all the assets and all the debts including the vehicle in your posession and the debt associated with it. You would be listed as a co-debtor as well. In addition, the borrower filing bankruptcy will have to state his intention regarding the vehicle. He should state he wants to keep it and that payments will continue to be made. The borrower will not likely sign a reaffirmation agreement as that would make him liable for the entire loan balance in case of default. Either way, his signing it would not make you liable for any deficiency. All you have to do is continue making timely payments. You need to find out if the finance company has a bankruptcy department where they need you to send payment once the bankruptcy is filed. You will need to make the payments even if noone sends you a statment. Lastly, the payments will be \"ghost\" payments not showing up on the credit report if no reaffirmation agrement is signed.",
        "While the co-borrower must list all assets and co-debtors, his/her filing bankruptcy should have little effect on you. The bankruptcy will discharge the co-borrower from any further financial liability on the vehicle loan which will make you solely responsible for payment on the loan. If you continue to make payments in a timely manner, the bank will not move against the vehicle.",

    "question": "I entered into a contract to pay someone money. That happened before I was married. I am married now. I defaulted on payment and a lawsuit has been filed against me. If a judgment is obtained against me, will my community property be at stake? If there is a judgment, can I just file for bankruptcy to discharge the debt?",

        "Under California community property law, debts incurred by either spouse prior to or during the marriage can be satisfied by executing or levying upon community property. So while your wife's separate property owned prior to marriage or acquired during marriage by gift or inheritance is beyond the reach of your creditor, 100% (not just your half) of community property can be reached by the creditor. However, should you alone file a bankruptcy, the discharge awarded to you serves to also discharge all creditor claims against the community, including your wife's interest in the community property.",
        "If you are sued and the creditor gets a judgment, there are various ways that the judgment can be enforced (collected). The judgment creditor can seek to collect from any \"community property\" which includes money in joint bank accounts and wages of the debtor AND the debtor's spouse. In order to garnish the spouse's wages, the creditor has to file a motion to permit the garnishment, but I have seen that happen more than once.\n\nYou might be able to discharge the debt in bankruptcy, but there are a lot of factors that have to be considered before anyone can give you an opinion on that as a strategy. Contact a bankruptcy attorney that represents consumers in your area.",
        "Yes, community property earned by your wife can be used to satisfy a debt entered into by you alone. Cal. Family Code Section 910 says that's even if you incurred the debt before marriage.\n\nYes, a personal loan can be discharged in bankruptcy under normal circumstances and in California, your spouse enjoys the \"community property discharge\" which protects community property earned by your wife and applies so long as you stay married and alive.\n\n(If you are no longer married to her or alive, then her income is no longer community property and could not be used to satisfy your debt.)"

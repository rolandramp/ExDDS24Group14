    "title": "Can they legally remove our rims and the tires?",
    "question": "we bought new tires on a payment plan through a company. We have paperwork showing we are paid through 5/15. Today is 5/11. Today we found one of their techs with our car on a jack removing the tires, when we caught him all 4 tires were still on the car. In order for them to take the tires they have to remove our rims and take them to their shop. They called the police and the police made the tech put the lug nuts back on and lower our car. The company claims we are 2 months behind on payments and that the paper states that only if we pay x ammount will we be paid through the 15th. Even the police agreed that the paper says we are paid and it is signed by the shop manager.",

        "There is a certain tire store chain that has a very solid contract with a \"security interest\" on all of the parts, tires and work they perform. Many bankruptcy attorneys list them as a \"secured debt\" in bankruptcy.\nIf your tires are with this company, then it is like a car or homeloan, if you do not pay the bill then they have a right to repossess their collateral.\nHowever your having kept good records kept you out this predicament. To assure this does not happen on secured debts, maintaining files of the contract and payments is a very wise thing.",
        "I am not aware of self help being allowed anywhere unless the lender with a valid lien is repossessing the car. Did they try to take the tires off the car while it was in the shop or was it someplace else?\n\nYou need an attorney now to avoid having this happen again."

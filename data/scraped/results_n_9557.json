        "First, do not be scared. You will not go to prison in Ca. for non-payment of a debt under any circumstance. I am confused though. You talk about a loan of 500 pounds, yet this shows as being in Los Angeles, where we use dollars.\n\nYou do not say your present age, but under 18 you are a minor. As a minor, you may be able to disaffirm (set aside) the contract. Some of the code sections that might apply are Civil Code, Secs 1556 & 1557 and Family Code, Secs. 6500, 6700 and following.\n\nEven if the debt is collectible, there are limits on what a debt collector can do to collect from you. You might talk with an attorney who is familiar with violations of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (not us). Such an attorney might be able to persuade the debt collector to behave more reasonably.\n\nFinally, regardless of your legal rights, consider your reputation. That is something that will follow you throughout your life. It is easy to damage and hard to repair.",
        "There's no such thing as debtor's prison, so even if they sue you and get a judgment against you, it's just the right to get the money they're owed. That said, you lied to get a contract, and the companies you lied to gave you a loan and phone services, so you'll have to pay them back, plus, probably, interest, late fees, and their collection costs, so the quicker you pay, the less it will cost you. Get ahead of this and pay your debts off immediately, and if you can't pay it all at once, then offer, and make, regular payments until the debts are completely paid off.\n\nDisclaimer: Please note that this answer does not constitute legal advice, and should not be relied on, since each state has different laws, each situation is fact specific, and it is impossible to evaluate a legal problem without a comprehensive consultation and review of all the facts and documents at issue. This answer does not create an attorney-client relationship."

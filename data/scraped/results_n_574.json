        "What does your lawyer say? No lawyer? Remember, BK is more than checking boxes on forms you find online. Find/consult/hire a lawyer using the Avvo feature \"Find a Lawyer\". Make a list of 4-5 having many 5 star reviews from satisfied clients. If you don't get a prompt call back from one, go on to the next on your list. Some offer a free consultation by phone or in person.\n\nThat said, I add the following: Getting a default judgment is a process. You will know it is close when you get a form in the mail from the LL lawyer titled: Request for Entry of Default/Judgment. Even if a judgment is entered, a BK will temporarily stay the eviction process and all past due rent can be discharged.",
        "Hire a lawyer and get your bankruptcy going ASAP. Also prepare to move if you haven't already. Good luck to you.",
        "There is no specific timeline. Judgment could be entered quickly and then the creditor filed for a writ of execution, which allows for the garnishment. This could go quickly but it tends to take some time as the creditors are not always quick moving. If default is entered I would try and file for bankruptcy as soon as possible. You will also receive notice of a garnishment about to take place so sometimes people file right before that. Hope this helps."

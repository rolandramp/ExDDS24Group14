    "title": "How do I, as a self-employed, respond to Earnings Withholding Order (wage garnishment)?",
    "question": "This is from my old credit card debt. My freelance DBA company (1 man company) received EWO from a court. What is my best response on WG-005? This form only allows two responses. Either 1. not an employee or 2. employee with earnings amount. This company hasn't had any income since the beginning of 2019, and the court paper lists the employee's name (my name) incorrectly. Would it be correct if I respond to this as \"not an employee\"?",

        "Thank you for choosing me to answer but this is not my practice area. You have a good answer from Mr. Wilens.",
        "Answer the form \"not an employee.\" That is correct because you cannot be both employer and employee. You have no employer. This should alert you to go to the courthouse and pull the court file to gather more information about the judgment that was previously obtained against. An EWO would only exist if you already had a judgment.\n\nOthers have suggested you consult a bankruptcy attorney but that is premature. You have not even mentioned how much money you owe per the judgment. Another interesting question is how the creditor came to locate and you and decide to serve an EWO in the first place. Once you get the court file, you should get a consultation with a consumer rights/consumer debt attorney.",
        "You are the owner of the business not an employee. Having said thet, it is time to consult a bankruptcy attorney to see if that is an option for you.",
        "I am the wrong person to have asked this question, but common sense tells me you’re not an employee.",
        "You need to retain an experienced CA bankruptcy attorney. Use AVVO's Find a Lawyer tool to select a qualified attorney. Good luck. THIS IS NOT LEGAL ADVICE! YOU NEED TO SPEAK TO AN ATTORNEY WHO IS LICENSED IN YOUR STATE FOR LEGAL ADVICE. This is merely suggestions for you to think about in discussing your situation with the local attorney."

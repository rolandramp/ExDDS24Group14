    "question": "My attorney got judgment in her favor for attorney fees $ 20S . The judgment reads that the court cannot find that all the attorney fees incurred by her have been reasonable and necessary . She charges 10s annual interest on the balance of $ 58K . I cannot afford to pay even the interest every month . I wrote her 2 letters requesting to forgive the debts since she got already paid over $ 45K for this case . I stopped making payments since last October . She never responded to my written requests and keeps sending billing statements . Can she ignore my request just to accrue interest every month and not to respond ? Is there a Statute of Limitations on an Attorney Recovering Fees ?",

        "You can be proactive. Contact the LA County Bar assn and file for fee arbitration. Otherwise, she can let the interest keep accruing for quite some time before she decides to sue. before she sues, (unless she does it in small claims court with a 10k cap), she has to give you the notice of your right to arbitrate with the bar. if both parties agree, that arb can be binding. Otherwise it isnt binding. You should try to get th arb going now, while things are fresh in your mind, and before too much interest accrues. You might as well see what happens and not live with this hanging over you for years. if you lose, you have options like any debtor, such as bk. If your financial condition is really poor, with lots of debt, you might want to consult with a bk atty now. if bk is appropriate, you can discharge the attys claim, and then not have to screw around with fee arb.",
        "The court's fee award and your letters should be useful to show that the fees that you have paid in excess of that amount should either be refunded or the entire bill should now be considered paid in full, but no more than that. It seems as though your paying what the court found to be reasonable, plus something for interest, should have ended it long ago.\n\nYour prior payments on this debt should end (no more payments) and you should wait to see if the attorney files a collection lawsuit for more than you've already paid. At that point, you can defend yourself in court with your own debt collection defense attorney. I doubt they will sue you on the facts stated in your posting and then if no lawsuit is filed, the statute of limitations should end this nightmare.\n\nRobert Stempler (please see DISCLAIMER below)\nwww.StopCollectionLawsuits.com\nwww.facebook.com/SoCalConsumerLawyer\nTwitter: @RStempler",
        "Demand fee arbitration through the State Bar of California, if I recall correctly, I don't think they can award interest on the legal fees? If there are out of pocket costs the lawyer incurred on your behalf for reasonable, necessary and authorized work like motion fees and depositions, you should agree to pay those, but preserve your right to dispute the attorneys fees you claim were excessive?",
        "Presumably, you had a written fee agreement with this attorney. if so, the statute of limitations for breach of written contract in California is 4 years from breach or date of last payment."

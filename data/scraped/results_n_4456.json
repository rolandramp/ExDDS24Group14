    "title": "In California, is a surviving spouse liable for the medical bills of a deceased spouse?",
    "question": "The dying spouse's only asset is a 401(k) plan. The surviving spouse's only asset is an Single Family Residence home. The property is held as Sole and Separate, the property is their primary residence, the survivor is 47 years old.",
    "answers": [
        "The estate of your deceased spouse is liable for the debts left. You need to seek legal assistance on the estate itself and how to distribute it.",
        "As stated by prior counsel, the estate of the decedent is liable for his debts, not the surviving spouse. In both instances it depends how title was held. If the surviving spouse is the designated beneficiary of the 401 (k) the asset will pass outside of any probate. In regard to the house, you do not state in whose name the property was held as \"sole and separate.\" If it was in the name of the decedent, depending on it's value, it has to be subject to some kind of judicial proceeding and may be subject to creditor's claims. If it was held in the name of the surviving spouse, inquiry will have to be made as to the source of the payments on the house. If they came in whole or in part from the earnings of either spouse some portion of the house would be community property and could be subject to creditor's claims. But that would require a creditor to file a petition in the probate court to open a probate estate.",
        "The SPOUSE is not liable for the debt, but the estate is. If the spouse is named as beneficiary on the 401k, that should pass directly. The house, regardless of title, could be considered a community asset and therefore the estate may have an interest in it. This would be based on the actual character and use of the house, not just the title. For instance, was community property assets (earnings etc) used for the mortgage, maintenance, taxes and insurance. I would speak with a probate attorney to make sure you are adequately protected based upon your specific circumstances."

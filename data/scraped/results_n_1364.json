        "I absolutely give Mr. Gambrell credit for a correct answer. I only wish to add an important concept that may help you and other debtors that may read this. A Bankrupt Estate was created when you filed your bankruptcy, and it includes everything that you owned the moment before you filed your Petition for Chapter 7 relief. Once your Petition is filed, the Trustee owns your entire estate (you don't own a thing!), including your home, subject only to the exemptions to which you are entitled. The Trustee can sell your home for as much as he/she possibly can. Hopefully, you were aware of this possibility before you filed your bankruptcy. It underscores why the client should always get an accurate, current evaluation of the value of his own home. Attorneys have absolutely no mechanism to determine the current value of a home, but the Trustee does have such a mechanism! The Trustee can find out exactly what a home is worth by placing a sign in front of a home and listing it on the MLS. A house is worth exactly what a willing buyer (anyone) is willing to pay a willing seller (the Trustee) at arm's length. This is why I always stress from the outset of my representation that it is essential that the client does his/her homework to find a very good realtor to put a current value on the home, or even a broker (for a BPO=Broker's Price Opinion). Remember, the value you place on the home, no matter how pedigreed the evaluator, does not bind the Trustee in the least. It only helps you evaluate the likelihood that your home is or is not an important issue, and allows you to understand that the cost of getting rid of your debt could result in the loss of assets, including a home. Compounding this fact is where your home happens to be located (In real estate, values are most largely determined by, you've heard this before, \"Location, location and Location.\"). You live in Los Angeles, a coastal city of rapidly increasing (and volatile) values. Determining home values, especially in all of the coastal cities and towns from San Diego to Humboldt County, is entirely unpredictable in today's market, While you are in bankruptcy, any increase in the value of the house makes it more valuable to the bankruptcy estate, which makes the Trustee more likely to stretch out the \"negotiations\", giving him/her less incentive to settle quickly. I recommend that you turn to your attorney, who, if experienced, knows the nature and proclivities of this particular Trustee (They are very different!) and present a realistic offer to the Trustee based on the current market conditions, not what you simply hope he would accept. Be realistic! Trustees are very human, so you do not want to deliberately offend the Trustee. Remember, he/she owns your home! A lowball offer can offend a Trustee, like you are challenging his/her willingness to work hard to return more of a distribution to the creditors, which is his/her duty, or calling his/her actions \"bad faith\". That is not a beneficial move, simply because you will build a wall between you and the Trustee rather than a conduit for communication. Just remember that the Trustee is human, and will react as any human would if his/her integrity or motivations are questioned. Since you seem to have an attorney, I do not recommend getting another attorney!\n\nI hope God Blesses your efforts!",

        "Good faith is a term that is normally used when a party has a fiduciary duty to another, which is a legal duty to act solely in another party's interests. The chapter 7 trustee has a fiduciary duty to the unsecured creditors to collect as much money as possible so those creditors can recover as much money as possible from the nonexempt assets owned by the debtor and does not have a fiduciary duty to the debtor or the debtor's attorney. If the trustee thinks your offer was a low ball offer and that he/she can get more by placing the asset for sale to the general public, then the trustee is doing what he/she is supposed to do as the trustee of the bankruptcy estate."

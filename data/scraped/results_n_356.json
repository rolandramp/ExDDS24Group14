        "I love this question. You have a few options in your bankruptcy case as it relates to your car and car loan. As has been suggested before me ... you could get the car back through Ch. 13 reorganization bankruptcy ... in some instances you may be able to lower the interest rate and cram down what you owe on the car down to it's fair market value (instead of what you owe). If you are upside down on the loan and owe more than the car is worth, it might make more sense to surrender this vehicle and replace it. So long as you have regular monthly income, you might be surprised how easy it can be to get a car loan immediately after filing BK. If you want to leave the door open on getting the car back, you should act quickly. #TempusFugit",
        "If you file a Chapter 13, then yes, you can definitely get your car back. You would file a chapter 13 plan to cure the arrears on the car loan. If you file a Chapter 7, then you may be able to get back the car, but you won't be able to keep it unless you can convince the creditor to allow you to reaffirm the car loan.",
        "If the car has not yet been sold, then filing a Chapter 13 would require them to return it.\nUnfortunately, this rarely works with a Chapter 7.\nYou need to file immediately.",
        "A number of factors enter into the answer to that question. You should meet with a bankruptcy attorney to review your options.",
        "You would have to file a ch 13 case and before the car is auctioned.\nBest of luck.\nAdam Arnold"

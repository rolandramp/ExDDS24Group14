    "title": "Can an HOA charge late fees for one missed payment every single month for consecutive months? Or does a one-time late fee apply?",
    "question": "I missed a special assessment about 2 years ago ( never received notice, it occurred in the month I moved out of the property). The HOA has charged me 10% of my regular HOA dues ( not 10% of the assessment) every month consecutively for 24 months. Is that legal?",

        "The other attorneys are correct. You will need to look at your association documents. What you describe seems to happen all the time, sometines through mistake, sometimes for other reasons. In our state, the HOA could charge 10% on the missed payment the first month and per annum interest on the amount due thereafter. What some managers do is to ignore the subsequent regular payments and treat every payment as applied to the oldest item first. That makes all subsequent payments late and subject to the initial 10% late charge. It increases the revenue to the association, and cynically, for those management companies that keep a percentagel of late charges paid by owners, it increases the manager's fees. Some documents will say that payments apply against the oldest item first, but you may be able to fignt that. If the money has mounted up until it is worth fighting over, you could challnege the charges. If it is not that big a charge, it may be worthwhile just to pay or reach an agreement to pay a percentagbe just to be done with the issue. Good luck.",

    "title": "How to refile I-485 after it has been denied but with a pending I-130",
    "question": "I entered the US as a visitor then married my USC spouse. My i-485 was denied due to wrong filing of the affidavit of support form. We filed for an appeal but after 6mos it has been denied too because they said the appeal should by signed by myself instead of my husband so the motion to reopen or reconsider has not been done. So what i wanted to ask is can i refile my i 485? If yes, do i need to refile another I-130 with it even thoughh its still pending. And what other documents do i need to refile?",

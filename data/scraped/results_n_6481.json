        "85% of these sources of income are exempt from levy. Even the other 15% can be pretty easy to stop if you have very low income.\n\nChristopher Larson",
        "Internal Revenue Code Section 6334 determines what property is \"exempt from levy.\" Among other items it exempts unemployment benefits; annuity and pension payments under the Railroad Retirement Act and from the military; workmen's compensation; minimum amounts of wages; service-connected disability; and public assistance (supplemental security income for the aged, blind and disabled) under the Social Security Act, or state or local government public assistance or public welfare programs for which eligibility is determined by a needs or income test. If what you are receiving is covered under that last category then, no, it cannot be garnished by the Federal government. There is a similar exempton from State levy in Code of Civil Procedure Section 704.080(c). Also see 704.130.",
        "Here is what the IRS says in response to your question:\n\nThrough the Federal Payment Levy Program (FPLP), Social Security benefit payments outlined in Title II of the Social Security Act, Federal Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance Benefits, are subject to the 15-percent levy, to pay your delinquent tax debt.\n\nHowever, benefit payments, such as lump sum death benefits and benefits paid to children, are not included in the FPLP. Additionally, Supplemental Security Income (SSI) payments, under Title XVI, and payments with partial withholding to repay a debt owed to Social Security are not levied through the FPLP. Beginning February 2011, the FPLP may exclude certain delinquent taxpayers who receive social security payments if their income falls at or below certain established levels, based on the Department of Health and Human Services poverty guidelines.\n\nBefore your Social Security benefits are included in the FPLP, we will send you a final notice of our intent to levy, with appeal rights, if one has not already been issued. If we don't hear from you, or if you have already received this notice, we will send you an additional notice CP 91 or CP 298, Final Notice Before Levy on Social Security Benefits, explaining that your Social Security benefits may be levied. See Tax Information for Appeals for additional information about your appeal rights.\n\nYou have 30 days from the date of this notice to make arrangements to pay your tax debt before we begin deducting 15 percent from your monthly benefit. See Topic 201, The Collection Process, Publication 594, The IRS Collection Process, and Publication 1, Your Rights as a Taxpayer, for additional information.\n\nBecause the FPLP is used to satisfy tax debts, the IRS may levy your Social Security benefits regardless of the amount. This is different from the 1996 Debt Collection Improvement Act which states that the first $750 of monthly Social Security benefits is off limits to satisfy non-tax debts. Fifteen percent of the Social Security benefit will be levied through the FPLP regardless of whether or not the remaining benefit sent to you is less than $750."

    "title": "How do i evict someone in the army reserve who doesn't pay rent?",
    "question": "my 36 year old brother is in the army reserve but currently lives in my home and does not pay rent(at least not to my knowledge)i have told him several times to move and he refuses and says he has legal rights to live here since i apparently signed a contract that he received in the mail while he was away at basic training camp.i assumed he was lying as i don't recall EVER signing any type or rental/lease contract.than he sends me a pic of the contract but it looks like a forged signature.when i informed him that if i would have no other choice than to proceed with an eviction process he told me to go for it since the military would provide him with a free lawyer and i would spend all my money and still lose.keep in mind that my mother is co-owner and is not cooperating with me due to the fact that he is her son and she doesn't want to kick him to the curb but at she same time she wants him to pay rent & help around the house...which he refuses both. how do i get this leech out of my house?!?!",

        "You raise to issues here 1) eviction, 2) forcing your brother to pay rent. 1) You can follow eviction proceedings under state law, by obtaining an attorney. Most likley, your brother would not be covered under Servicemembers Civil Relief Act because because he is not activated. AR 27-3, paragraph 2-2 states that Reserve Judge Advocates will provide legal assistance to Reserve Soldiers. This attorney may represent him in state court, but if he did not pay rent that is owed, he will have to pay it at the end of the day. 2) you may work this through your brother's military unit. Soldiers have a duty to pay debts, including for rent. If your brother refuses to pay for rent, you may want to notify his chain of command which will investigate this and may take adverse administrative action against him. It looks like your brother is taking an advantage of the sitaution. It may be advisable to retain an attorney to send a demand letter to your brother to show him that you are serious and that he needs to start contributing.",
        "The military will NOT provide him with a free lawyer---don't believe his BS. He has access to legal advice from the JAGs on base, but they will not defend him in court for this civil matter--he will have to pay and from what you describe HE will lose. He's entirely on his own. Take him to court as the other attorney's have advised and evict him IAW CA laws.",
        "Yes, you can evict him by issuing a basic 3-Day Notice to Pay or Quit.\n\nIf he fails to comply, you have to file an Unlawful Detainer action against him at the courthouse.",
        "His military status is irrelevant. If u r the owner and u don't want him there evict him.",
        "First, the Army will not provide him with a free lawyer--that is not true. Second, if he tried to bring this up with his command, they would do nothing except maybe make him start paying rent. Third, there is no contract that could require you to provide him with a place to live. Go ahead and evict the deadbeat.\n\n\n\nJohn Whitaker\nWhitaker Law Group\n1218 Third Ave; Suite 1809"

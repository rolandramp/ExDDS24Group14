    "title": "Will filing a Chapter 13 allow me to catch up on my past due house payments??",
    "question": "I am 11 months or about $15k behind in house payments. My house is in foreclosure, but I have not received a sale date. I had a modification in the past and was told that I can't do another one until 24 months have passed. I am not sure how long it has been. I will have to look that up. My question is when I do get a sale date and File a Chapter 13, that will cause an automatic stay. However, will the plan let me make up those payments so that I can keep my home. I didn't have a job before and now have one to support my mortgage payment plus a payment plan. I have heard so many conflicting stories, like it won't save my home and the bank doesn't have to accept my past due payments. I need help.",

        "One of the most common uses of chapter 13 is to allow home owners to bring their past due payments current over time. You will need to pay the ongoing payment, and the past due amount is spread out over a period of 36-60 months (3 to 5 years)\nDon't go it alone. It is very hard to figure out the forms and requirements of a chapter 13 without an attorney. Depending upon your case, most chapter 13 attorneys will accept some of their fees through the plan, so your plan payment also pays them.",
        "One common reason people file chapter 13 is to stop a foreclosure and allow them time to catch-up the delinquent mortgage payments. Chapter 13 does not require the lender's consent but it does require that you document your finances and explain how you can afford to pay your living expenses and keep your house. Chapter 13 is complicated so you should plan to have a lawyer help you with it.",

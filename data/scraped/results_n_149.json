    "title": "Class Action Law suit and BK ch 7",
    "question": "My BK chap 7 was filled end of Oct 2019 discharged in Feb/March 2020 and now I got a class action settlement check of $200, Can I cash check, since I was not the one initiating lawsuit? I did not even find out about it until after discharge. Ty",
    "answers": [
        "You may be able to, but I would suggest first contacting the Trustee for your case (even though he/she will have now been discharged), to get their position before cashing.",
        "You can cash the check for the reasons stated by my colleagues. Good luck and God bless.",
        "The Trustee is not going to care about a check for $200.00. The cost of administration would far out weigh the payments to the creditors. Cash the the check and use it to do something nice for yourself and others.",
        "Yes - you can cash the check.\nIf it were substantially more, your BK trustee would have the right to intercept it and use it to pay discharged creditors; but $200 is too small an amount to be an issue.",
        "The Chapter 7 Trustee is not going to care about a $200 check you received.",
        "The technical answer is \"no\" but as noted the practical answer is \"yes\". No one is going to bother with this due to the amount. For larger amounts in this District, the US Trustee has been reopening cases and having the trustee look into the situation. Many times that just results in an exemption claim, with the settlement going to the debtor, but not always.\nBut even if the $200 was not exempt (or even a considerable higher amount) no one will want to spend any time on this."

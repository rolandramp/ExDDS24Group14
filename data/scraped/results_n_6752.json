        "I think you have two questions here: 1) how to pay on the judgment; and, 2) how to get it removed from your credit report. A debt settlement attorney can begin the negotiations to try to get a settlement for you on the judgment. Usually, money in hand will get the creditor to the table, even though legally they don't have an obligation to reduce the amount owed to them. As for your second question, you should talk to a credit repair specialist about removing negative marks from your credit report. The credit repair specialist will give you an opinion on how you may get this removed from your credit report.",
        "I suggest you contact an attorney to negotiate it for you and then you can pay. Be aware though that even if paid they may not be agreeable to removing from you credit. But will appear as settled.",
        "If you want to communicate with this creditor to negotiate a balance less then full payment, the Creditor is under no legal obligation to work with you. However, with that in mind, it is always in your creditor’s interest to get paid something rather then nothing or simply sit on a lien that they can not collect for many years. You may want to week out a consultation with a good debt relief attorney in CA. If instead you wish to have the judgment removed from your credit report, you will need to file a Motion with the Court, request a hearing, serve the other side and present your case to a judge as to why you did not answer the complaint.",
        "When you say you want the judgment removed, I assume it is because you wish to make payment to satisfy the judgment, is that correct? In other words, you are not challenging the fact that there is a judgment, such as a default judgment entered because you did not respond to a lawsuit?\n\nA judgment creditor has no obligation to accept anything less than full payment of a judgment.\n\nHowever, if you \"satisfy\" the judgment, you can obtain an Acknowledgment of Satisfaction of Judgment. In California, a judgment debtor who has voluntarily satisfied a civil monetary judgment can file motion to compel entry of satisfaction of judgment pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure § 724.050.\n\nCode of Civil Procedure § 724.030 provides as follows:\n\n“When a money judgment is satisfied, the judgment creditor immediately shall file with the court an acknowledgment of satisfaction of judgment. This section does not apply where the judgment is satisfied in full pursuant to a writ.”\n\nWhen a judgment creditor refuses or fails to do so, the judgment debtor can file a motion pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure § 724.050(d)(2), which reads:\n\n“(d) If the judgment creditor does not comply with the demand [to the judgment debtor to execute, acknowledge , and deliver an acknowledgement of satisfaction of judgment] within the time allowed, the person making the demand may apply to the court on noticed motion for an order requiring the judgment creditor to comply with the demand. The notice of motion shall be served on the judgment creditor. Service shall be made personally or by mail. If the court determines that the judgment has been satisfied and that the judgment creditor has not complied with the demand, the court shall either (1) order the judgment creditor to comply with the demand or (2) order the court clerk to enter satisfaction of the judgment.”"

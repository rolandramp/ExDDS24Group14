    "title": "How do we inform a bankruptcy trustee that we think the person filing for bankruptcy is hiding assets?",
    "question": "My ex-landlord stole my security deposit, I sued him and won. But he refuses to pay me. Now he's listed me on his chapter 7 bankruptcy (no assets) as a \"creditor\" and wants to discharge his debt. He is claiming the property that he rented to me (and has rented or been abandoned for at least 5 years) as his primary residence. We pulled the title and he is not claiming this as his primary residence. We believe he's hiding assets as this home is worth more than he owes. He is the VP of his company, his children are also enrolled in a $12k per year private school, he owns a home plus a rental property. The property is still currently listed online as a \"rental.\" I am going to the Meeting of Creditors, but how do I inform the trustee about this, without being accusatory?",

        "It is not uncommon for a bankruptcy case to be filed without complete information and to then allow the debtor to amend to correct for anything that was omitted. So the common strategy is to allow the debtor to have every opportunity to \"come clean\" before bringing down the hammer of the law and alleging misconduct. The bankruptcy court is a division of the US DOJ and has access to the same tools that the FBI & NSA use. Every case gets a preliminary review for omitted assets and a deeper review can provide the Trustee with a lot more information. So if the Trustee becomes aware of issues, the staff can run this deeper investigation so that when the debtor is asked questions under oath, s/he is put into a corner to either tell the truth or to lie. If the choice is a lie, law enforcement is at the ready. Hope this perspective helps!",
        "Write a letter to the trustee and document your allegations with copies of records, etc. Bring a copy to the Meeting of Creditors in case the trustee has not had time to review your material. The trustee is interested in \"hidden assets\" because he/she receives a \"commission\" for liquidating them. At the Meeting of Creditors, be calm, professional and have evidence to support your allegations. The proceedings are tape recorded, so keep that in mind if you are tempted to stray from your mission. If there are undisclosed assets, the debtor could be denied a discharge, or the assets could be liquidated and a dividend paid to creditors who file claims. Good luck to you.

        "You can communicate with the trustee directly. You can also attend the Meeting of Creditors and ask questions about his petition, schedules, and the nature and location of assets, only. Do not attempt to delve into your personal claim.",
        "The responses are correct. One additional aspect of your question is the possibility that your debt itself may be non-dischargeable. Debts that are incurred through fraud or conversion can survive the bankruptcy discharge, but prompt action is needed -- a complaint must be filed within 60 days after the date initially set for the creditor meeting."

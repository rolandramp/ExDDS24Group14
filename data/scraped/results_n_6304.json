        "Consolidating the answers given:\n1. If HOA held a LIEN against your property, that lien CAN be enforced and your property CAN be sold after you have received a discharge (the discharge lifts the injunction you received when the bankruptcy case was filed -- 11 USC Sec. 362(c)(2)(C)).\n2. You remain responsible for any HOA fee that came due after you filed your bankruptcy case; a bankruptcy discharge does not wipe out any HOA fee that arises after the case was filed so long as you have any legal or equitable interest in the property (11 USC Sec. 523(a)(16)).\n3. If the HOA was not listed as a creditor in time to participate in the case, your debt to it might not be discharged to any extent (11 USC Sec. 523(a)(3) although some case law may contain specific facts to support a contrary result so as to discharge a debt that arose before your bankruptcy case was filed.\n4. If there was a lien that was foreclosed, this would dispossess you from ownership and the HOA could take action to remove you from the premises, such that even though you might be able to reopen your bankruptcy case and file a Notice of removal of the UD case to the Bankruptcy Court,",
        "Did they file a notice of lien while you were still in BK based on pre-petition past due amounts? Your facts are a little scetchy to understand the situation in full. Generally, bankruptcy does not relieve you from responsibility to pay HOA fees post-petition so depending on how much is your monthly payment your post-petition fees could occrue fairly quickly and could lead to new past due amounts which were not discharged.",
        "Under a chapter 7 bankruptcy MOST forms of UNSECURED debt are dischargeable. Recent case law, (In Re Beezley, 994 F.2d 1433 (9th Cir.1993), suggests that even when a creditor is not specifically included in the debtor's schedules and forms, if the debt was incurred prior to the discharge date, the debt is STILL considered discharged for legal purposes.\nIn your case, the levy issued by your homeowner's association may not be dischargeable under a chapter 7 bankruptcy as it may constitute secured debt. What you may consider is filing a chapter 13 bankruptcy to address any debt that may now be owed.\nIf you are interested in filing a lawsuit regarding quiet title you may consider doing so in civil court rather than bankruptcy court. It is unlikely that the bankruptcy court will hear the UD action as that is not an \"appropriate\" forum for U.D. cases.\nI advise you to consult with an attorney should you decide to proceed with an action against your HOA.\nLauren Womack, Esq.",
        "Your facts are incomplete. A bankruptcy attorney would want to verify dates and other information to advise you.\n\nIf the HOA had notice of your bankruptcy (did you list them as a creditor) then filing a notice of levy during your BK without obtaining relief from stay would be improper. A mere technical violation, without notice, probably will not result in any relief -- it may be a \"no harm, no foul\" situation if they were not listed as a creditor in your schedules.\n\nI agree you need to retain local bankruptcy counsel to review the matter and to represent you in any further proceedings.\n\nAs an alternative, if the facts are in your favor, an acceptable out-of-court resolution may be possible. The bankruptcy court will not be interested in hearing an unlawful detainer but could make orders which may effectively resolve it.",
        "More facts would be needed to accurately answer your question, but if you think of the HOA as being just another taxing authority with a lien on your property, it is likely that the HOA acted properly.\n\nWithout a full review of the facts, which are much more than what you can describe here, I can only guess whether you have a valid cause of action.\n\nHope this perspective helps!",
        "Your bankruptcy discharged relieved you of the personal obligation to pay the HOA fees. It did NOT, however, do anything to avoid the lien held by the HOA against your property. From what you are saying the HOA was well within their rights to foreclose on the property.\n\nAlso from what you are saying it sounds as though you filed your case without the benefit of an experienced bankruptcy attorney. If you had an attorney then you should be addressing your questions to him or her. If, as I suspect, you did not have an attorney then this may be a very costly lesson in why one is ill-advised to file a bankruptcy case without counsel.\n\nJust because you are allowed to do something it does not mean that it is wise to do it."

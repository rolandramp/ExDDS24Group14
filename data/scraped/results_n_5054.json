        "The creditor will claim that you have funds in the subject account(s) and that you have access to the funds. If there is an attempt to levy, a Claim of Exemption must be filed immediately.\n\nDid you, at any time, ever make a payment on the subject debt, or on any personal debt, by writing a check on that account?",
        "I'm assuming that the default judgment is against you, for your unpaid credit card debt, and you are concerned about execution of that judgment. (Correct?)\n\nThe judgment creditor may have an abstract of judgment from the court that issued the default. That abstract contains the name of the judgment debtor. The creditor will then attempt to execute that judgment, often through the county sheriff's department.\n\nThe creditor, working through the sheriff, can levy funds in a bank account, if the account is in the name of the judgment debtor. The creditor may also attempt to levy funds that are jointly held by the judgment debtor and his or her spouse. But I doubt its possible to levy funds in a business account, or any account, that is not the judgment debtor's bank account."

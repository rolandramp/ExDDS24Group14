    "title": "My spouse has a shopping addiction problem. What steps can I take to help secure our financial future?",
    "question": "While we continue to address her shopping addiction ( professionally ) , her actions have caused a substantial debt and affected our credit rating . We will try to rebuild , but what actions can I take to protect our family finances in the event this happens again . The debt has come in the form of credit card debt , taking cash from At Ms , not paying property taxes ( and using the money elsewhere ) , taking credit cards out for balance transfers . I've now taken full responsibility for paying bills . We've also setup a budget that we are reviewing weekly . unfortunately her addiction continues to cause her to deviate and hide money / charges . Is there a legal process I can take to separate ourselves ?",

        "In addition to the fine advice provided by the other attorneys, you should obtain a subscription to a credit report monitoring service (for both yours and her credit) which will alert you if anyone runs her credit (which sometimes happens when somone tries to open a new credit card).

        "Ms. Gruber offered several useful suggestions. You will need to get these debts settled, either after being sued on them or before, otherwise it will substantially worsen your credit score. An attorney who does such work should assist you, as these debt settlement companies often make matters worse (see my legal guide on debt settlement, below). Budgets are not effective for people with this sort of problem. Close all accounts under her name and reopen them under your name only and have very few accounts, so less for you to track. Keep all checks in a safe place that she cannot access, such as a safe, and do not give her online access to any of the accounts or account numbers.\n\nThe most complete and legal way to stop this from happening in the future is to have a court declare her no longer able to apply for credit or to enter into contracts, due to incapacity. This can be done with the help of an attorney who files special proceedings in Superior Court, typically probate and estate planning attorneys. Thus, the conservator (such as you) can then have all future contacts declared invalid and void, should she attempt to use her credit without permission of the conservator. You would also want to have the court order made a public record and filed with the credit reporting agencies. Also, put a freeze on her credit report, such that if anyone tries to use her credit, they must call the conservator for permission.\n\nRobert Stempler (please see DISCLAIMER below)\nwww.StopCollectionLawsuits.com\nwww.facebook.com/SoCalConsumerLawyer\nTwitter: @RStempler",

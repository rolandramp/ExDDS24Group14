    "title": "I have a storage unit. I want to file chapter 13 bankruptcy. They have a lien. Will I be able to get my stuff out?",
    "question": "I have a storage unit that I owe money to. The unit is in Nevada. The unit has a lien against my property. If I file bankruptcy in chapter 13, will I be able to get my stuff back immediately upon filing? Will the unit be able to sell my stuff? Do I have to add their claim to the Plan?",

        "Atty Bunce and Adams have given you good advice. The Chapter 13 will prevent them from conducting an auction but you will not have access unless and until the debt is secured. In some places, a lien must be perfected by the filing of a UCC Financing Statement, but the better view allows the storage lien on the grounds of a possessory lien, much like an automobile repair shop can hold your car until you pay for the repairs, bankruptcy notwithstanding. Guess we won't be seeing your stuff on a future episode of \"Storage Wars\", eh?",
        "Storage companies have a lien your property for unpaid balances. Generally they will not release the locker to the customer until it has been paid in full. On at least one occasion we were successful in having a storage unit release with the payment through the Chapter 13 but we were lucky.",
        "If they have a lien on your stuff, the lien will need to be paid in order for you to get your stuff back. Same as if you had pawned your stuff to them. You can arrange to pay off this lien in your Chapter 13 Plan. Hope this perspective helps!"

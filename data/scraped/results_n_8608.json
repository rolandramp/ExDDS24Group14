    "answers": [
        "Though they may at some point get or have a lien on your property, including real estate and personal property, most people have exempt property, and from the description of your circumstances, all you probably have is exempt property, so the lien has no effect nor can they obtain your unemployment benefits or any government assistance benefits. But, if you have other funding sources deposited into your bank account when they try to levy the account, they may obtain those non-exempt funds.\n\nThe source of the debt (unsecured credit card) usually does not limit the means of collecting the judgment against you, but some debts have additional procedures that they may take (such as federally guaranteed loans).\n\nWhere you served with the lawsuit before you received this default judgment paper? If not, you have the right to promptly set aside the default judgment and dispute the debt in court.",
        "\"What is an 8hour keeper?\"\n\nThat's someone who's posted at a business owned by a debtor (you) to take money that comes in.\n\n\"What is considered for lien in personal property?\" \"Can they really take personal property such as a car?\"\n\nYes. And in CA, judgments are good for 10 years (and newable for successive 10 year periods), and earn post-judgment interest of 10% until paid, so while you may only have $10 now, at some point you may own real estate, have money in a bank account, have a job whose wages they can garnish, etc. They can also do a \"debtor's exam,\" to put you under oath and ask you what valuable assets you own so they can take them, while adding their legal fees to your debt.\n\nDisclaimer: Please note that this answer does not constitute legal advice, and should not be relied on, since each state has different laws, each situation is fact specific, and it is impossible to evaluate a legal problem without a comprehensive consultation and review of all the facts and documents at issue. This answer does not create an attorney-client relationship."

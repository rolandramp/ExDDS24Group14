In addition to what the other two attorneys said, you might also want to consider settlement. The amount they are suing you for is very small. If you can settle this for one fourth, it might save you a lot of mental anguish and out of pocket expense, even if you plan to defend yourself. If you go that route and it works, I would suggest that you invest in an attorney to review the settlement agreement before you sign to make sure that your rights are protected.",

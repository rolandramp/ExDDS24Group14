    "title": "How do I know if my back taxes were discharged in my Chapter 7 bankruptcy?",
    "question": "I filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy and have gone to my hearing. I haven't gotten a discharge. I had back taxes from 2003 included in the bankruptcy. I filed my 2003 tax return in 2004. My lawyer told me that if the taxes weren't reassessed within 240 days prior to filing and if there was no fraud, then those taxes would go away. How do I know if the taxes were reassessed and how will I know if the taxes were discharged? Also, the IRS put a lien against my property. Can that be taken off by the filing of the chapter 7?",

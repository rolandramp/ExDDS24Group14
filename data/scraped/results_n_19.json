    "question": "I am disabled. I own no cars, no home. I have no cash. I got a summons paper stating I am being sued by capital one credit card for $3360. I have no way to pay it. I am in the process of filing bankruptcy but it will take me 14 months to pay it. I feel so lost. No way out. I cant find anyone to help me respond. I have been told by my bankruptcy lawyer to do nothing. That they can’t take my disability. To just wait it out till the bankruptcy is all done. Then I can get my life back.",

        "Has the lawsuit in Arizona been dismissed? What steps have you taken to prove you are a victim of identity theft. If you've taken the correct steps then you have a reasonable argument to request that the creditor return your money.\n\nIf you have never lived in Arizona and someone was using your identity then you should also explore possible debt collection violations.\n\nBut, first things first, file a police report, fill out an FTC Identity Theft Affidavit and order your credit reports.\n\nBalam\n\nletonalaw dot com",
        "You should probably talk to a lawyer with expertise in employment law. There are several provisions of the California Labor Code which deal with wage garnishments. If the employer violated the law, you are entitled to recover penalties, interest and probably attorney's fees, as well as get your money returned. You can definitely file with the Labor Commissioner, as well as get advise and/or assistance from a lawyer."

    "title": "Is a discharged debt still recoverable after bankruptcy",
    "question": "I had a car loan charge off discharged through a chapter 7 bankruptcy. The car was involved in an accident. My insurance company paid the finance company 2500 dollars because they still were the lien holder of record. Did I still owe them that money or should we have received the money for the value of the car.",

    "answers": [
        "My colleagues are 100% correct. The insurance pay off goes to the lien holder.",
        "I agree with Mr. Rausa. Your Chapter 7 discharged your personal liability (unless you signed a Reaffirmation Agreement) meaning the lien holder cannot come after you personally since you received a discharge, however, the lien holder still retains a security interest in the vehicle. If the vehicle was totaled then the insurance company was correct in paying the lien holder.",
        "A charge off is an accounting principle. Your car lender still retained a security interest in the vehicle regardless of your Chapter 7 Discharge. Your discharge only relates to your personal liability, not insurance proceeds. You do not owe the lien holder any money, unless you signed a reaffirmation agreement that was approved by the Court.\n\nBy Law, the insurance carrier has to pay the lien holder."

        "I agree with Mr. Foster.\n\nI've run into problems with life insurance companies that do not want to honor the use of a Section 13100 affidavit. Just recently I had to write a letter to the company's Vice President-Legal informing him that I planned to file a petition in Probate Court if the company would not honor the 13100 affidavit. I pointed him to the code section that states the company would be liable for all legal fees incurred in collecting the property if it became necessary to resort to that procedure. Magically, the company decided it could release the funds to my client after all.\n\nSo, if the company refuses to honor the affidavit, hire a lawyer and let him/her file a petition. The company will be required to pay the legal fees and court costs (but first try sending a letter to the Legal Dept. - it just might work for you, too).\n\nThis information is not intended to substitute for professional legal advice and does not create an attorney-client relationship.

        "My preliminary observations are as follows:\n\n1. Life insurance proceeds are distributed in accordance with the policy, which is a contract between the insurance company and the owner of the policy. Policies generally provide for beneficiary designations, which tell the company to whom it must pay the death benefits. If the policy provides for distribution to the decedent's estate, then a California Probate Code section 13100 Affidavit can skirt the requirement of probate. For the person entitled to the property to use this process, the decedent's countable California property must not exceed $100,000, and other criteria under the code must be met.\n\n2. If the decedent left unpaid bills, the person entitled to the insurance proceeds must review Probate Code 13109, which makes him or her responsible for the decedent's unsecured debts to the extent of value of the property he or she collects, and Code of Civil Procedure 366.2, which is the one-year statute of limitation.\n\n3. The claimant should review these points with experienced local counsel."

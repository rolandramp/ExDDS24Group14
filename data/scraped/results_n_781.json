        "First and foremost, set your \"feelings\" aside. There is no legal basis for fraud on an EDD overpayment claim that was discharged in a bankruptcy proceeding. At this point, the Notice of Overpayment should be irrelevant. Think of the accusations as an \"unscrupulous\" tactic, rather than an unethical allegation. Hire an attorney to assist you in this matter.",
        "I'm a little confused here regarding the timing of the events in your question.\nI'm not sure what relevance the opposing side's lawyer's behavior during the settlement negotiations has to anything if you \"settled in (your) favor.\"",
        "It is unethical for an attorney to use the threat of criminal prosecution to gain an advantage in a civil matter. Overpayment by EDD without any misbehavior on your part is probably a dischargeable debt. Do you have a lawyer representing you? No lawyer? Big mistake.

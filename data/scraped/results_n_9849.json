        "While you're correct that it wasn't the 'right way' to do it, the question you must ask yourself is whether your husband gained an unfair advantage in the Judgment by it terms, For example, did the two of you have any property that needs to be divided equally, or did you have any debts that also would need to be shared between you. I am assuming that you don't have any minor children (as they aren't mentioned) but if you've been married awhile, then you may be entitled to support, or even if it's a short-term marriage, and you are earning significantly less money than him. The bottom line is that if you think the terms of the Judgment are unfair, then you should contact an attorney to file papers to get the court to 'undo' and then 'redo' the Judgment after a trial; if not, then maybe in the long term, it is the easier way. Either way, a consultation with an attorney would hopefully clarify your options.",
        "If you want to set it aside you should contact the district attorney and bring it to their attention if you wish to file criminal charges. Further, you should file a Notice of Motion to set aside the Judgment as soon as possible. Also the Judgement which was entered may deny you important property or support rights. if thta is the case you may also claim that he breached some important fiduciary duties and that you should be awarded that property. Consult an attorney.",

    "answers": [
        "You should contact a Nevada debt collection attorney who can have the judgment entered there for enforcement.",
        "You will need a certified copy of the judgment and file it in the Clark County District Court together with a petition. Then you have to arrange for personal service. If no response in 21 days, the court will eventually enter an order domesticating the California judgment. But all this may be unnecessary if the debtor continues to work for a California employer or if the debtors maintains a bank account with a bank having a location anywhere in California.\n\nPut your money in your pocket and investigate whether or not there is anything to pursue. Most debts are uncollectible. Hope this perspective helps!",
        "You will need Nevada counsel to assist you to \"domesticate\" the judgment in Nevada."

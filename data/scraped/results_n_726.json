        "The Means Test form can get fairly complex quickly especially with listing income correctly. You can try it yourself, however, it is usually best to hire an experienced bankruptcy attorney to help you so you go into the bankruptcy case as clean as possible and have as few mistakes and hurdles as possible. I strongly suggest you consult and hire a bankruptcy attorney to help you with this.",
        "Filing bankruptcy on your own is possible, but it isn’t always a wise decision. Part 1 of the means test determines your GROSS INCOME relative to the median income for the household size in the region where you live. The means test requires listing ALL income from ALL source for the past 6 months.... income deductions are not taken in Part 1 of the means test but in Part 2.\n\nIn many instances filing Bankruptcy isn’t a simple DIY project. I would advise you to seek legal assistance immediately - certain pro bono organizations such as legal aid or Public Counsel even offer free assistance.",
        "Not sure how you figured you might only list one job's income on the means test when you have two jobs, but you are bound to have many more problems preparing bankruptcy on your own, and something you never thought was a problem will be the landmine that blows up on you. The answer to your question is pretty self evident, list your employer as \"multiple\" and combine the average of all income and deductions as required. Hope this perspective helps!"

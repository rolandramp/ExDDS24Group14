    "title": "Can my stepfather prevent us from acquiring funds as beneficiary from moms 401k.",
    "question": "mom recently passed with no will. She remarried three years ago and he was named on her insurance policy but my sisters and I were named for her 401k (she recently changed it from 100% going to him, without his knowledge). She also bought herself a brand new truck, computer and tv. They kept all monies separate except for mortgage and household expenses. He recently called to inform us that the death certificates came in and that we were beneficiaries for the 401k and that her bills needed to be paid. I dont mind paying them but should we if her is benefiting from all she bought , her insurance which isnt much and her social security.",
    "answers": [
        "As other lawyers correctly stated; if you were the beneficiaries of the 401(K), the plan fund doesn't go through the estate (probate), it goes directly to you. You as beneficiaries should not not be liable for the mentioned debts. The facts are not clear. I believe it is best to consult an estate planning lawyer in person.",
        "If you are beneficiaries of the 401(k) the money comes directly to you and should not be part of the estate. Debts of the decedent have to be satisfied from her estate and are not the responsibility of the heirs who receive money outside of the estate (e.g. insurance, pensions).",
        "You may have a problem with the 401k. ERISA laws do not allow any beneficary except the spouse unless the spouse waives their rights. If this was an IRA where the funds came from an 401k the beneficary designation would control.",
        "I also agree with the other attorney responses. The 401(k) will pass outside of the estate directly to you and your sister as named beneficiaries. But note, federal law requires the spouse to be the primary beneficiary of a 401(k) plan benefit unless the spouse signs a waiver. Further, if your mom lived in California, the 401(k) part or all of it may be considered community property and thus your stepfather may have rights related to the retirement account regardless of whether he is named as the primary beneficiary. I would recommend consulting an attorney about this matter.",
        "Speak with the local estate attorney to make sure the 401K is not part of the estate.",
        "You need to discuss this with probate attorney. Her debts belong to the estate while the 401k may not be in the estate..."

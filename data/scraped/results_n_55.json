    "title": "Debtor filed chapter 7 for llc and chapter 11 for his personal with civil case pending for > 3 yrs. how can we recover money.",
    "question": "Landed money 3 years back and debtor did not return money in timely manner so we tried to do foreclosure. He filed civil case and it was in civil court since last 3 years pending. Now debor filed chapter 7 for his LLC and chapter 11 for his personal bankruptcy. We have lawyer who is fighting for civil case but now we need some advice for bankruptcy to enter our self in claims list under bankruptcy case. Debor did even fraud to civil court as foreclosure stopped 2 years back by agreeing depositing money in escrow account. We checked with escrow account recently and that account is closed. Please advice what should we do?",
    "answers": [
        "You absolutely need to consult with an experienced bankruptcy attorney in chapter 7 and chapter 11 cases and creditor experience (many of us represent both debtors and creditors). The filing of the bankruptcy cases has resulted in an \"automatic stay\" that stops all litigation against the parties that filed bankruptcy so you should also talk with your civil attorney if you have one. There are too many issues that need to be discussed to determine your options as to the two bankruptcy cases, thus this site cannot provide you with the information you need. There are pertinent deadlines in each case that you need to also be aware of - so I urge you to locate an appropriate attorney as soon as possible. Good Luck.",
        "You will need to file an \"Adversary Action\" in both proceedings, so both Judges & Trustees are aware of your adversary action. You should also plan to attend the Sec. 341 \"Meeting of Creditors\" if those have not already passed, to explain your position to the Trustee.\n\nAdditionally, be aware of the \"claims bar dates\" and make sure you have something on file before that deadline.",
        "I agree with Mr. Firth. Use the \"Find a Lawyer\" tab at the top of the page to find a bankruptcy attorney in your area. Specifically, find a bankruptcy attorney who represents creditors.",
        "You need to hire a bankruptcy lawyer who represents creditors who can analyze your case and lay out your options for you. I have found that most of the bankruptcy lawyers on this site represent debtors and won't be much good to you. Look at some of the larger commercial bankruptcy firms."

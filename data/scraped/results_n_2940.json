        "If the debts are truly beyond the Statute of Limitations, you can simply tell the collection agencies that the debt collection is unenforceable and demand them to stop calling you and stop sending you letters. If they continue to attempt to collect a legally unenforceable debt, you can recover money damages from them under the Federal FDCPA. The worst thing you can do is to make a payment as that revives the Statute of Limitations. My advice is to do nothing other than what I stated above.",

        "Before you pay anyone, make sure you get an agreement in writing confirming that your lump sum payment will extinguish the debt. DO NOT pay anything unless you have in writing the account, the amount of the settlement, and that by your payment the debt will paid in full. You can also try to negotiate getting the debt deleted from your credit report as part of the agreement. Also, you have rights under federal and state law which protect you against abusive debt collectors. If you feel you are being abused, deceived, harassed, and/or receiving excessive calls, you should contact an experienced consumer attorney for help.

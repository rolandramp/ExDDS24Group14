    "question": "I need my car for work. I spoke to these car title loan sharks who are telling me they are exempt from chapter 7 BK. I hate having to file it and contemplated for a year but now have no choice since work is slow and has been for almost a year. This car title lender is scaring me. Can they be omitted from Ch. 7 like they say? My car is an exemption by the way. Please help as I am currently now looking for a BK attorney to file.",

        "An excellent Bankruptcy attorney can advise you on several opinions that you do have in a Chapter 7. A very experienced attorney will think outside the box and provide solutions that may not be the same as a less experienced attorney. For example, you said you wanted to file a chapter 7. I cannot assume that you would qualify for a Chapter 7, but I would consider, if I were your attorney, explaining the benefits of a Chapter 13, whereby you would at least lower your interest rate to 5 or 6 percent, and possibly pay much less for the vehicle. Everything depends on the facts of your situation. (To be very clear, i will never be your attorney - I am in Fresno, CA and do not accept cases outside of the Eastern District of CA. You are in the Central District!)\nMy point is, choose your attorney very carefully. Look for excellent reviews on this AVVO.com website, along with a lot of experience. The number of reviews is not necessarily indicative. There is no substitute for experience! You can also look at YELP for honest reviews. Best to you!",

Unsecured debts get discharged. Secured debts must be repaid to avoid a repossession. No creditor is \"exempt\" from bankruptcy. There may be some confusion about terminology.

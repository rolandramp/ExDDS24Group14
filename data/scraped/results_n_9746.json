        "Good Evening,\n\nOrdinarily in a Ch 7 Bk all the credit cards must be discharged. When one or two cards are selected to be paid and several others are not, this is called preferential treatment. Therefore, it is usually not allowed to keep some and discharge some. Sometimes if you contact the specific card company, notify them that you are filing BK and would like to keep the card, the court will allow you to keep it only if the company agrees. However, this is hard to say for sure without the opportunity to analyze all the details of the credit card debt and what you had purchased with that card.\n\nThe BK is going to stay on your credit history for 10 years. Simply keeping a card that is in good standing is not going to make any significant difference. You would be just as well off, if not better, discharging the debt and opening a new card after the BK.\n\nIf your home is worth less than what you owe, generally you can keep your home without issue."

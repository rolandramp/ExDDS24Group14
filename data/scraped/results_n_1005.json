        "I agree that schedule J contains your actual expenses, but I'm glad you looked at the IRS standards before filing because I was once at a hearing where Judge Bowie told the debtor in another case, \"that may be what you spend, but it is your decision to rent such an expensive apartment and drive such a fancy car. You may have the apartment and the car, but not at the expense of your creditors.\" in that case, the judge determined there was disposable income that could be used to pay creditors even though there technically wasn't.",
        "I am reading your question and looking at the areas of concern that you listed. It appears that you have tax debt, Student Loan Debt, a DSO, and perhaps some credit card debt. I do not see this as a very easy straight forward Chapter 7 case. For instance, taxes can be very tricky to address in a Chapter 7. Equally, student loan debts are it own area of law. May I suggest you seek the advice of an experienced local San Diego bankruptcy attorney who has specialized knowledge in both the Bankruptcy and Student Loan areas."

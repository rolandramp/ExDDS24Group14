        "If you can easily prove that the contractor was unlicensed, then disgorgement is the way to go. You don't need a jury trial, and it is unlikely the unlicensed contractor is going to want a jury either. Fraud is much more difficult to prove, and usually there is no point to proving fraud for purposes of punitive damages if the defendant's net worth wouldn't justify a huge punitive damage award.\n\nIn California, it is illegal for an unlicensed person to perform contracting work on any project valued at $500 or more in labor and materials. California Business & Professions Code section 7031(a) prevents an unlicensed contractor from collecting on debts owed to them by consumers under contracts due to their unlicensed status. This means that a court will not enforce the illegal contract.\n\nFurthermore, California Business & Professions Code section 7031(b) gives consumers who have contracted with unlicensed contractors the ability to sue for restitution or reimbursement of all monies paid to the unlicensed contractor for \"any act or contract\".\n\nIn short, an unlicensed contractor will not only be unable to collect against the owner but may actually be liable to pay back to the owner every penny that was already paid him. This law applies even if the unlicensed contractor completes the job and even if the work performed is otherwise perfect.",
        "For a disgorgement claim under B&P Code 7031 to be successful, the claimant must prove the elements: the scope of work under the contract required the contractor performing the work to be at all times properly licensed, that the contractor performed th work, that the contractor was paid, and that the contractor was unlicensed.\n\nOur office handles a variety of construction law cases, including disgorgement claims under B&P Code Sec. 7031. Our practice with any construction related matter, but especially disgorgement, is to immediately request certified license histories from the Contractors State License Board in the names of the alleged \"unlicensed\" contracting company, its owner, sales reps, and any of its personnel, and for whatever \"license number\" if any, was used on the contract. We normally set the time period of the requests to between six months from the date of the contract to six months after completion or termination of the contract. Usually within a month, the CSLB will return \"certified histories\" saying there is no license history for the name/number requested. For the purposes of B&P Code Sec. 7031, (and many other claim statutes e.g. mechanic's liens, stop payment notices, bond claims, etc.) a certified history from the CSLB is the only admissible evidence to prove a contractor's \"licensure.\"\n\nWe next assemble evidence of whatever payment instruments were used by the client to pay the unlicensed contractor (cancelled checks, wire transfers, PayPal, EFT, etc.) and determine the exact amount that was paid and is to be disgorged. We also assemble evidence of our contract damages.\n\nWith the contract, certified histories and payment evidence in hand, we draft a verified complaint for, among other things, B&P Code 7031 relief and attach the contract, histories and the financial data as exhibits. We also include various other related causes of action as appropriate (breach of contract, common counts, etc.) to recover the damages not part of the disgorgement.\n\nOnce the defendants are served and appear with their verified answers, we are prepared to either immediately bring a motion for judgment on the pleadings, or serve a set of request for admissions and then file a motion for summary adjudication. (We currently have a disgorgement action motion pending in federal court against an unlicensed contractor from out of state. )\n\nWith proper, admissible evidence, disgorgement motions are rarely denied, despite their harsh consequences. Another benefit to the motion practice is that the judge decides the motions and whether the plaintiff has met the burden of proof. The emotional component of the decision is removed from the jury. The legislative history of the statute is' intent is unambiguous: California does not permit unlicensed contractors to receive compensation for work requiring a license.\n\nThe problem is not so much getting a judgment for disgorgement, but like all judgments the problem is collecting.

Sometimes those cases are prosecuted and sometimes, often years later, those clients receive payments, often as the restitution part of a defendant's plea bargain. But, sometimes nothing happens. Still. if you want to win the lottery, you got to buy a ticket. Good luck with your case.",
        "Each case has to be evaluated on its specific facts. One case may justify a claim for fraud whereas another would not. As for disgorgement, one should always request it in any case regarding an unlicensed contractor.

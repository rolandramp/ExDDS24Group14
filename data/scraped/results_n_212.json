    "question": "To Whom it May Concern. Thank you for your willingness to answer this query gratis. I am interested in seeking representation to file bankruptcy. The debt does not exceed $50,000. I do not own property and my car is worth X < 3,000 according to Kelley Blue Book. My 2018-2019 income was under $20,000. My 2020 income shall be less.",

        "Unpaid taxes are a priority debt.\n\nYou can't discharge them unless they are at least 3 yr. old, all the returns have been filed, and no new assessments in the last 8 mos.\n\nYour first step is to file all returns. Then you have to review your IRS tax transcripts to know when penalties were assessed. You should do this with your CPA, bankruptcy atty, or both.\n\nIt is unclear whether the taxes will be dischargeable, but the important points are 1) you must get those returns filed; and you 2) must look at the history of assessments and penalties for non-payment.\n\nDischarge of taxes is very technical; you will need to work with a lawyer and likely a tax professional as well.\n\nState rules may be different, so you need a lawyer. GOOD LUCK",
        "In addition to the excellent answers already provided, there are certain events that can delay the time period to run for the taxes to be considered dischargeable. Being in a prior bankruptcy during that period or being in an offer in compromise (OIC) can delay those 2 and 3 years periods.\n\nAs mentioned previously, a SFR (Substitute For Return) can be filed on your behalf by the IRS. Once that occurs it will be difficult to have the tax debt discharged. An \"Account Transcript\" of your prior tax years can tell you what the IRS did for SFRs, accepting tax returns, and assessing additional taxes.\n\nI highly suggest you consult with a bankruptcy attorney who knows the dischargeability of tax debt.",
        "I agree with much of what has been said before me. Income Tax obligations must: (1) have become due at least 3 years ago; (2) tax returns must have been filed at least 2 years ago; and (3) must not have been assessed or reassessed within the last 240 days. Under your facts, as I understand them, you would not be able to discharge your tax obligations where the tax returns have not been pre-pared/filed. Perhaps discharging other debts will improve your position such that the tax debt(s) can be handled. Bankruptcy attorneys generally offer no obligation consultations; I suggest you find an attorney in your community with a good reputation and consult with him/her.",
        "I agree with my colleagues that it is essential that you file returns for the years in question in order to start the 24 month period that must run before these taxes become dischargeable in bankruptcy. But I would do so without delay, since the issue of whether a tax return filed late constitutes a valid \"return\" for purposes of bankruptcy dischargeability.\n\nIn California, in In re Martin, 508 B.R. 717 (Bankr. E.D. Cal. 2014), the bankruptcy court found that a late-filed return still constitutes a return. And as recently as June 19, 2020, in In re Starling, No. 13-36564 (CGM) (Bankr. S.D.N.Y.) a New York bankruptcy court agreed. But the issue has not yet reached the United States Supreme Court, and a minority of courts around the United States have held that late-filed returns do not constitute returns for purposes of allowing the tax to become discharged.\n\nThe safest course of action would be to file the return and delay filing the bankruptcy until 24 months have passed, being certain to allow for a few days to verify that the return was received by the taxing authorities. If you are under pressure to make payments, if necessary you can set up an installment payment plan and make minimum payments. As a general rule, tax authorities will abate collection proceedings if you are making payments. At your level of income, the payment could be quite modest.",
        "There are several time periods that must run for income tax debts to be discharged in a bankruptcy case. These time periods can be extended due to the occurrence of certain events.\n\n1. Taxes must be more than 3 years old since the last date on which the return was due to be filed for that year.\n2. Returns must have been filed more than 2 years prior to filing the bankruptcy case.\n3. Taxes must have been assessed more than 240 days prior to filing the bankruptcy.\n4. No fraud or willful evasion of the tax.\n\nIn your case, the fact that you have not yet filed the returns would make them not dischargeable. The earliest you would be able to discharge them is 2 years after you file the required returns, assuming the other time periods have also run and other requirements met.\n\nIt is important to note that the taxing agencies will eventually file a \"substitute return\" if you fail to file your return. Once that is done, it is very unlikely that it will ever be dischargeable in a future bankruptcy case. So it is a good idea to get the returns file regardless of how you proceed now.\n\nFor more specifics on discharge of tax debts see https://www.bklaw.com/bankruptcy-taxes/",
        "To have a chance of discharging an income tax debt, the returns MUST be filed at least two years PRIOR to filing bankruptcy. If you haven't filed the returns, and if you wanted to try to eliminate the tax debt (as opposed to paying it), you would need to file the tax returns ASAP, and then wait two years. It sounds like you probably cannot hold out that long. You should file the tax return regardless. If the tax debt is $10,000 (probably will be 12-13K after penalties and interest), you can set up a payment plan with the IRS pretty easily and they will give you 60 months (sometimes more) to make payments. Also, if your income is really low, you may be able to do a streamlined offer in compromise (settlement).\n\nI suspect, once you sit down with a local attorney to discuss your case, they will tell you that you should probably file bankruptcy now, offload all your other debt, and then deal with the tax debt directly with the IRS after the bankruptcy.",
        "Attorney Harris gave you a good answer. Income Taxes can be discharged but the rules are complex. Based on the facts presented, I'm not sure your taxes can be discharged yet. I suggest that you consult with a bankruptcy lawyer who is familiar with discharging taxes in bankruptcy (Not all are) to review your options.",
        "Dear Newport Beach:\n\nYou can file bankruptcy any time, so long as you meet the eligibility requirements of Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 bankruptcy. But past-due income taxes are only dischargeable in bankruptcy if the:\n\nTax was for a tax year whose return due date (including extensions if properly filed) was 3+ years prior to the bankruptcy petition - 11 USC 507(a)(8)(A); and\n\nTax return for the tax year was actually filed 2+ years prior to the bankruptcy petition - 11 USC 523(a)(1)(B); and\n\nTax was assessed 240+ days prior to the bankruptcy petition - 11 USC 507(a)(8)(A); and\n\nThere was no fraud in making the tax return or any willful evasion of paying tax - 11 USC 523(a)(1)(C).\n\nIf you have non-dischargeable taxes, you might want to consider whether filing a Chapter 13 bankruptcy could help you to catch them up over a period of 3-5 years.

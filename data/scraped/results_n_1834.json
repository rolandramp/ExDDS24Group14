    "title": "Separation Agreement and the cost associated to draft by an attorney",
    "question": "Me and my husband are married for 2.5 yrs and separating amicably. What would it cost to draft a separation agreement with an attorney? I think since we are on amicable terms, it would be wise to get all the work done now but the dilemma is when I search for an attorney, what should I ask and what would be a true measure of attorney's character i.e. so that he/she doesn't try to lure either of us in to hiring him/her to represent one of us and making it difficult for the other?",

        "You can both jointly hire a \"mediator.\" A mediator does not represent either party. Rather, he/she helps the parties understand their respective rights, and craft mutually acceptable agreements in a neutral manner. Both parties meet with the mediator simultaneously, and work out settlement terms. Once reached, the mediator can draft up all the paperwork and file it with the court. This process is much cheaper than both parties hiring their own lawyer, and it also saves time, as there is no back and forth between lawyers. If either party wants their own lawyer to review any agreements or otherwise advise him/her, that can happen as part of the mediation process. Yet, many people never hire their own lawyer as part of mediation, as the mediator helps both parties understand their rights, and options.",
        "You have to understand the ethical demands on a lawyer. I never, I repeat never, represent both parties in a divorce. I will have one of the spouses by my client and I will meet with the other person and make sure to advise them that I am not their lawyer and they should consult with someone of their choosing if they wish. I then present the agreement as it has been given to me by my client and, if the other side agrees, I can have them sign the final papers and if they don't, they don't. I am also very clear that they should take the papers and be sure before they sign them that they agree with them.\n\nDivorce papers are not, in actuality, difficult to understand and see what is divided and who pays what debts. It is also not that expensive, depending on a lot of issues such as length of marriage, types of assets, division and the like. Children are the biggest problem, as you might imagine.\n\nYou can have a lawyer write up the final papers if everything is already decided and the like. Just ask the lawyer what he or she will charge and you can get a good idea about costs and the like. However, don't misunderstand if the lawyer says they will not represent both of you in the divorce.",
        "It is very hard because of ethics for an attorney to represent both of you. It is a better practice to have an attorney write it for one of you, and then let the other review the draft with an attorney of his or her choice. Most agreements of this sort should take about two to three hours to draft - so costs will depend on the lawyers hourly rate and the number of revisions. The drafting attorney would have to review the Schedules and Income Declaration which you exchanged to make sure that all the issues are covered."

    "title": "How long does a CA hospital CA have to bill me? Saw 06/08, never rec'd a bill. Heard from their debt collector in 2011.",
    "question": "I saw a doctor in June 2008. They billed my insurance in a timely manner then failed to invoice me for any patient responsibility. The hospital (Century City Doctors Hospital) filed Ch. 7 Bankruptcy in Oct 2008. I never once heard from them until my account was sent to a collection agency (Fidelity Creditor Services) assigned to the hospital (Aug 2011) in Nov 2011 stating my account was past due. They are unable to produce an invoice w/billing codes, details, etc. and damaged my credit without knowledge or consent. How is this legal? I was bullied into paying as they had me by my credit score with no way out.",

        "I agree with attorney Corbin, it is right the that the Statute of Limitations is four years and most likely will not stop them from reporting the bill as unpaid in all credit bureaus.\n\nFurther, it may not even stop collectors from filing a lawsuit as the SOL is a good defense but need to be asserted by the defendant. So if the amount is reasonable a collector may even try to collect judicially as most lay people do not know this defense.\n\nIf you are sue always seek legal advise, you may be surprised that you do not owe what you think you do.",
        "Two schools of thought here. Yes, you absolutely have a FDCPA issue in that the creditor cannot produce any verification of your debt. By law, if they cannot verify the debt, it should not be pursued. On the other hand, you admit that you owe the money, and your failure to pursue the matter and pay the bill in a timely fashion is just as much your fault as it is theirs. And, in CA, there is a 4 year SOL on suing you for the money, but that doesn't stop them from reporting the bill as unpaid."

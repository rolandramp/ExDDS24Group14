        "It all depends on the terms of the trust instrument. If the trust provides that upon the death of the last to die of your parents the assets are to be distributed to you, then you can transfer the properties now. The real estate can be transfered to you by a deed from you as trustee to you; the annuities can be transfered through the insurance companies and the car though the DMV. If the terms of the trust provide for a later transfer to the benefiriaries, then you have to follow the trust provisons.\n\nDisclaimer: Please note that this answer does not constitute legal advice, and should not be relied on, since each state has different laws, each situation is fact specific, and it is impossible to evaluate a legal problem without a comprehensive consultation and review of all the facts and documents at issue.

        "Based on what you said, all of the property will ultimately flow to you. But, how it gets there will depend on how the property is titled.

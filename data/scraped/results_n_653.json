    "title": "Add A Debt to Chapter 7?",
    "question": "I filed chapter 7 bankruptcy in Montgomery, AL. The bankruptcy was discharged May 2017. My NJ tax refund was garnished because of a medical debt that I supposedly owe but I did not include it in my bankruptcy because I was unaware of the debt at the time I filed. How can I get my NJ tax refund that was garnished back to me? And how can I prevent this upcoming yearâ€™s return from being garnished? I currently live in Los Angeles and I am unable to reach the attorney who helped me to file.",

        "Hopefully you had an attorney that can handle this for you. Most courts follow a rule similar to In re Beezley, a 9th Circuit case, that refused to reopen a closed case to add a creditor where the chapter 7 case was a \"no asset\" case, based on the idea that reopening the case wasn't necessary. All that was needed was to notify the creditor of the bankruptcy and they debt was included in the discharge.\n\nThis may not be the law in your jurisdiction, so you must talk to an experienced bankruptcy attorney where the case was filed to get advice and assistance. You may need to reopen the old case, pay a filing fee (and hopefully pay an attorney to make sure this is done correctly), add the creditor, notify them and have that debt included in your discharged debts. This isn't needed or possible in the 9th Circuit.\n\nOnce you do that recovering the money is another issue. Is the creditor entitled to the money they received because they didn't know about the bankruptcy discharge and they didn't know because you left them off the schedules? Are they entitle to at least their costs of getting the money? Is there some reason they should have known about the bankruptcy? Lots of questions to explore and that will require an attorney experience with bankruptcy in the area where the case was filed.",
        "Atty Rausa's answer is spot on. I also recommend having your BK lawyer send a copy of your discharge to the taxing authority . Tell your BK lawyer to see if In re Beezley covers your situation. Here is the citation:\n\nIn re Beezley (1993) 994 F.2d 1433 (9th Cir)",
        "You need to contact your Alabama Attorney and discuss this. It may be a case of providing the bankruptcy paperwork to the collection agency, or it may require other action. Do you have your bankruptcy documents. If not, and you can't get your attorney to answer the phone, then you need to get a different bankruptcy attorney to obtain the documents.",
        "There are very few debts that can be collected by the tax intercept program. The very first thing you have to ascertain is the exact entity that the State of NJ sent the refund to. Typically there is a notice from the taxing authority that identifies this.\n\nSecondly, you need to supply that entity with a copy of your Discharge. There is some work that needs to be done here to be able to identify the specifics of the problem and then to arrive at a solution.\n\nYou should contact a debt resolution specialist who also understand bankruptcy law."

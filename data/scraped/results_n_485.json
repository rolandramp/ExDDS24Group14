    "title": "What can we do about record company refusing to honor our federal court order awarding us all assets of the debtors' estate?",
    "question": "My partner and I are songwriters/producers that signed to a production company and a publishing company owned by the same man. Both companies breached our contracts. We litigated release agreements freeing us but requiring them to still account and pay royalties due us for recouped projects. They didn't pay so we sued. Before the docket date, the principal bankrupted the companies to avoid paying. We're the only producers out of 6 that filed proof of claims and attended every hearing. It became a chapter 7 case and the judge after 8 years in bankruptcy ordered we become 50/50 owners of all assets of both estates in 2018. Most companies that did business with the debtor honored our court order. One while acknowledging us as new principals, refuses to pay us royalties due ALL the other producers that were under the production company which we are now entitled to commission. We asked the label about accountings in 2015 before the bankruptcy finished and the COO sent us back to the original production company for accountings, despite not having paid them royalties in at least 5 years prior. Does the civil filing and bankruptcy affect statute of limitations? What are our rights?",

        "Your thoughts are neither clear nor organized. I can't tell from your post what Court orders for payment existed outside Bankruptcy Court. There is no such thing as a \"docket date\". I doubt that this is a Chapter 7 case but don't think that it matters. I can't tell from your post what Court orders for payment/enforcement existed in Bankruptcy Court. Someone needs to ascertain what collection activity has been expedited/allowed/blocked by the Bankruptcy Court and where (Bankruptcy Court your other \"Federal Court\", or some other Court) further payment/enforcement/disputes are to be litigated. No one in this forum could possibly know from your post or any post. I presume that you have attorneys involved in the Bankruptcy Court and other Federal Court case who have informed opinions on your issues. I am confidant that all lawyers here expect you to hire a lawyer to wade into this or that the matter is small or speculative if you don't already have an adequately informed attorney.",
        "You are asking a free Q&A forum about royalty accountings acquired after a bankruptcy, estates, and statutes of limitations? This is a serious matter that requires serious attention. Hire an attorney to wade through everything and demand whatever is rightfully due you. A reputable record label should not care about ripping off someone's rightfully due royalties? Who else would they be giving them to anyway? Makes no sense to me. (And statutes do toll... so don't dilly dally.)",
        "Statutes of limitation vary from state to state and from issue to issue, so you definitely need to have an attorney analyze the facts of the case. That said, the fact that you have been in and out of the courts will most likely have an impact on the analysis",
        "I'm not sure from your question that the production company is refusing to abide by the bankrutpcy court order. You need to talk to an entertainment lawyer and show him all the paperwork to figure out what you need to do."

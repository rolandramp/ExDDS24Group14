        "I am guessing that you are asking about the exemption for your home as well as the worker's comp?\n\nYou should go see a bankruptcy lawyer, or two and discuss your financial situation. BK lawyers are trained to know what if any are the options for you, can examine the documents and advise you on what they mean, and most BK lawyers will do this during a free consultation. A person would have to be crazy to file bankruptcy without an attorney when you have valuable assets."

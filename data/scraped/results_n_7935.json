    "title": "Chapter 11 - Bankruptcy - Does interest on debts owed stop running during the bankruptcy?",
    "question": "Once the bankruptcy is ordered under Chapter 11. If a debt is owed, does the interest stop accumulating? If so does it stop at the time the BK is ordered or when the BK filed? Also, looking for an attorney that has significant experience in representing business creditors in complex bankruptcies and intellectual property.",
    "answers": [
        "See a local attorney who handles Chapter 11 cases. They are different than Chapter 7 and 13 cases. If what you propose in your Chapter 11 plan gets confirmed, then the plan governs. You have much more flexibility in Chapter 11.",
        "Normally, interest on unsecured (credit card debt, debts to individuals) debt does stop. Interest on secured debt and taxes does not and you will need to be involved in a 'cash collateral' stipulation with each such creditor to control the interest. You mention a difference in when the bankruptcy is ordered or when filed? Is this an involuntary case? Usually the bankruptcy is ordered the minute the case is filed. If you are interested only in Los Angeles attorneys, you could check the AVVO listings or if not, get in touch with me.",
        "Depends on the type of debt. Yes for most arrears, no for taxes and secured debts that exist and are paid outside the plan. Some debts keep accumulating interest while the bankruptcy is ongoing."

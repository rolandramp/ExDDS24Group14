    "question": "I filed my chapter 7 petition in December 2018, my hearing is schedule for February 2019. Although we wonâ€™t have our taxes done by then, can they try to come back and take your tax refund if we get one this year?",

        "Yes, the trustee can request your tax refund if you cannot exempt it. I would recommend amending Schedule B and listing the tax refund, estimating the amount, and then amended Schedule C and exempting the amount with the wildcard exemption (assuming that you have that one available to you). It is likely not available to you if you are using CA 704 exemptions and exempting equity in a home.",
        "As you have been told by others, a tax refund is an asset. Any refund, even if for part of a year, that is owed to a debtor is part of the bankruptcy estate. If not exempt, the trustee gets that part of the refund.\n\nAn attorney representing a client in bankruptcy would normally have listed this and exempted it if possible or if not exempt, warned their client about this.\n\nRemember, anything that a person owns or has a right to is an asset of the bankrutpcy estate when the case is filed. Certain other assets can become property fo the estate after the case was filed. A tax refund, even if you don't know if you are entitled to it or how much it might be, is an asset to the extent it was an overpayment prior to the bankruptcy being filed.",
        "Yes. You should amend your schedules, list the potential refund and exempt it.",
        "You have to disclose to the trustee what your tax refund amount is. You 2018 tax refund is already considered an asset of the bankruptcy estate even if you won't receive it. Typically, you can estimate the amount of tax refund you will get, list it, exempt it if you're able to.",
        "Yes - because it was already an anticipated asset when you filed.\nYou should be able to exempt it, however, with CA's wildcard exemption (unless it is not available to you)."

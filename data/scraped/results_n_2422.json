    "title": "If I do not claim my dependents on taxes, can I use them for Chapter 7 Bankruptcy Means test?",
    "question": "I am the noncustodial parent - have my kids approximately 42% of the time. My ex claims both children for tax purposes. I am in severe debt and want to file Chapter 7. Can one or both my dependents be used in the means test? If so, can you point me to the legal reference? Some months they are with me more than 50% and I pay child support.",

        "I agree with Richard for the most part. Dependent for taxes is not the same as dependent or household member for bankruptcy. Many times I've had a father with 2 children 50% of the time and I have taken them as 1 dependent ( 2 x 1/2=1). I've never had a problem and I always disclose what I'm doing on my Petitions. HOWEVER, you can not \"double dip.\" So if you claim one child as a dependent (like in this scenario), you shouldn't take any child support deduction.\n\nYou need to sit down with an experience attorney in Redding. A consultation shouldn't cost you a dime. I bet you can find many, good, local attorneys here on Avvo.\n\nRob",
        "No, you can't claim them as dependants, but the child support that you pay is a deduction from your income on Schedule I",
        "I disagree with ALL the other 12 answers or agreements by attorneys. Why? It is never fun arguing these but I have NEVER had to argue one. I will give you the 15 page decision that I site and trustee has never argued against yet which because you have some kids so much percentage the means test does NOT expressly state what to do..you can prorate which makes sense under the facts. Read In Re Skiles 504 B.R. 871 (Bkrtpcy. N.D.Ohio 2014) That 15 page case carefully goes through why I say what I said above! Good luck. You may not need if income beats it or expenses..but if you can use additional HH members and beat it, then I am glad I helped.",
        "Even if you fail the Means Test, you may be eligible to file bankruptcy if you can pass the \"good faith\" test. More info on that topic is below. Hope this perspective helps!",
        "I agree with the other two responders. First and foremost, sit down with a bankruptcy attorney. Most don't charge for the initial consultation. The attorney can do a quick analysis of whether you qualify for a Seven or a Thirteen. Then you can plan accordingly.",
        "It's unlikely that you will be able to claim your children as part of your household. Please remember, however that the means test is a two part test. You may be over the median, but still qualify for a chapter 7 after you take your deductions including the child support you pay. Sit down with a competent bankruptcy attorney and go over your information. They can help steer you in the right directions.",
        "You won't be able to claim them as members of your household but if you pay support that is a deduction on the means test. You should meet with a qualified bankruptcy attorney."

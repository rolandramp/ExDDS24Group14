    "title": "Can a judge order the parties in a divorce go to mediation?",
    "question": "I met with a lawyer and he told me that it wouldn't make sense for us to litigate our divorce because all we have will be spent on legal fees. He suggested we go to mediation but my wife has hired a very dishonest lawyer who doesn't let her go to mediation. He just wants to milk our community assets till its all gone and my wife just doesn't understand that. Is there anyway I can ask the court to order her to go to mediation if I agree to pay for it?",

        "Unless you are able to stipulate in writing to an arrangement for the children you and your spouse will be ordered to meet with a conciliator (mediator) before the court will make orders regarding the custody of your children. Attorneys do not participate in these sessions and Los Angeles is the only county that is still a \"non-reporting\" county, which means the conciliator does not make a report to the court. As to the other issues in the case, both you and your spouse need to have complete information and access to a lawyer who can advise you with regard to the law as to any specific issue before and during the mediation process and certainly before you sign anything. There are a significant number of lawyers -- and a few non-lawyers -- promoting themselves as mediators. A mediator is not supposed to provide legal advice to either party and is not supposed to take any legal action on behalf of either party but we are seeing clients who have signed agreements without knowing what assets they actually have and after the supposed mediator has filed a Petition on behalf of one of the parties. Good family law attorneys will engage in reasonable efforts to settle their cases but only after they have the information that will permit them to fully advise their clients. You should not assume that you know everything necessary for your case to be settled or even that you are aware of all of your assets and debts. We have consults with people on a regular basis that are being pressured to \"go into mediation\" by the other party when it is clear that the other party has been the one handling the family finances or is the one running a business or the one that has extracted a promise that their pension \"will not be touched.\" Without complete information, going into mediation is a little like falling down the rabbit hole. This is just one of the reasons each party must file a preliminary declaration of disclosure before a judgment will be entered even if there is an agreement to waive the final declaration of disclosure. The declarations of disclosure are comprised of Asset and Debt Schedules and Income and Expense Declarations. Litigants characterize their spouse's lawyer as \"dishonest,\" \"slimy,\" \"money-grubbing\" etc., etc. but almost without exception couples who are ending their marriages have good reason not to be wholly trusting of the other party -- another reason for the declarations of disclosure. If a spouse is unfaithful what would make the other one think they would not steal? Lawyers who practice family law on a regular basis are usually very good at providing good advice to the client and promote settlement of some or all of the issues in their cases.",
        "If there are children involved and someone files a Request for Order regarding custody, the court will order the parties to first participate in mediation. The subject of that mediation however, will be limited to the subject of custody and coming up with a parenting plan.

It's still her case and she should be able to keep control over what course of action she takes. If her lawyer is preventing her from going to mediation (assuming she might otherwise want to go), then it's time she got another lawyer. Although some may disagree with me on this, I always encourage my clients to talk to their spouses as long as they can - i.e. as long as they are still getting along and the lines of communication are still open. It doesn't cost anything to talk to your spouse and her lawyer should not discourage that UNLESS the two of you are not getting along and are not able to be productive when you communicate with each other.",

    "title": "Please define \"qualifed principal residence indebtedness\" as it applies to the mortgage debt relief act.",
    "question": "We purchased a home that was continuously our primary residence for the past 7 years, we refinanced so it is a recourse loan. We are planning to short sale the home, therefore will receive a 1099c. We will be moving in to our vacation home shortly, which will become our primary residence. I know cancellation of debt income is nontaxable when the debt is due to \"Qualified principal residence indebtedness\". Does this mean \"qualified principal residence\" at the time the loan was made OR at the time the debt was forgiven? In other words, do we need to wait to make the vacation home our primary residence so we will not have to pay taxes on the cancellation of debt from the first home that will foreclose OR does it not matter when we make the vacation home our primary residence?",

        "The short answer is that the prior attorney's response is right.",
        "A home qualifies as your principal residence for the occupancy requirement of the Mortgage Debt Relief Act, if, at close of escrow on the short sale of your home, you have lived in the home two out of the last five years. Since, in your case, you have lived in the home five out of the last five years, you can move into your vacation home before close of escrow and still qualify, provided that you close escrow within three years of vacating the house. Remember that the debt must have been used to buy, build, or substantially improve your principal residence or used to refininance debt that you incurred to buy, build, or substantially improve your principal residence."

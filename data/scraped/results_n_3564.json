    "title": "A lawsuit has been filed against me for hospital bills. I have not yet been served. I am trying to negotiate without any luck.",
    "question": "Hello. A lawsuit was filed against me for a little over $10,000 for 2 hospital bills. I only found out about the lawsuit because of a marketing mailer I received from a third party notifying me of the lawsuit. I have not been served as of yet. The lawsuit was filed on 4/16/2014. I have been in touch with the agency the last 48 hours trying to make payment arrangements but they will not budge and are planning to move forward with the lawsuit. What steps should I be taking at this point? I have offered $500 per month which is far beyond what we are able to pay, but the minimum they will accept is $885 per month. Is there any way to stop this action?",

        "While I have not seen the bills or the lawsuit my guess is that an attorney should be able to reduce the amount and get you a reasonable payment plan. I would guess that you are being charged the rack rate for the services. An attorney should be able to negotiate that down.if u had medicare or heath insurance I would be the charges would be less. Also how old are the bills and who is the plaintiff. What court is it files in. Many firms like ours have special rates depending on the circumstances.",
        "Be sure to respond to the lawsuit in a timely manner, as failing to do so will allow the agency to seek a default judgment against you. You can try to negotiate a settlement or payment plan with the agency, but do not get lulled into a false sense of security (you will still need to respond to the complaint in a timely manner).\n\nThe litigation process can be confusing, and it might be best to have an attorney guide you through the process. Also, an attorney who is familiar with the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and Rosenthal Act (California's version of the FDCPA) might be able to find some statutory violations which would give you some leverage in resolving the litigation and the debt.",

        "Unfortunately there isn't a way to stop them from pursuing their collection via a lawsuit. What you can do is respond to the lawsuit and make sure that there are no issues as to the collection, including statute of limitations or other matters that may affect their ability to collect. Not responding to the lawsuit will result in a judgment entered against you and possible bank levy, wage garnishment or liens on real property."

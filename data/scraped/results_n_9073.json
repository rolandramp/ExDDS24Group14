        "If you did not refinance this home and it is your personal residence, your loan would be considered a purchase money loan (the loan you originally used to purchase the property). Then the only choice the lender has in CA is to take back the property. They also cannot charge you a deficiency. By definition the loan is non-recourse. Further, you would not have any income from debt relief that would be taxable because you fit under two exceptions. The first is that the loan is non-recourse, and the second is that you are under the $2,000,000 limit established by federal law.

        "A short sale will negatively affect your credit and you may be liable for income tax for the amoun tof debt forgiven.\n\nBy doing a short sale, what you are asking the bank to do is to accept less money for a debt which is currently owed on the property. The government has certain programs that are aimed at assisting people whose homes are under water, however, they do not guarantee that the bank will accept less money for a debt. If there are two or more mortgages with different banks, then your changes of being able to short sell your home drastically reduce because you have to convince different banks to take less money each and the banks want to minimize the losses on their budgets. Also, the banks will fight amongst themselves.\n\nIf you purchase a new home before short selling, the bank is less likely to allow a short sale because they will simply ask whether you were able to pay a down payment on the new house. If you were, then you were able to save and the bank is less likely to accept it. you may want to short sell your house first and then purchase another home.\n\nA short sale negatively affects your credit for 2 - 3 years. The negative repurcussions are slim when compared to foreclosure or bankruptcy, but they will affect your credit rating. This occurs because you have escaped a debt by paying less than the amount owed and the bank is entitled to explain to other potential creditors that you escaped a debt.\n\nFinally, when you are forgiven a debt, such as the $120K that you seeking to be forgiven by the bank, the bank writes off the negative difference between the mortgage and the sale price as a loss with the IRS. ***The IRS will charge you with $120K of income for the year.*** This is because you were \"given\" the $120K when the bank agreed to forgive the debt and forgiveness of debt (also called 'discharge of indebteness') is seen as income with the IRS. You will incur income taxes on $120K, which will be between 25-39% federal taxes, depending on your income level, plus state income taxes. The federal taxes are avoided if (1) you are insolvent (your assets (money, property, etc, but NOT including income) are exceeded by your debt) or (2) if the short sale is your primary personal residence. I sounds like this is your personal residence, so the taxes will be forgiven, but you may want to seek the help of a tax attorney in the process.\n\nDisclaimer: Please note that this answer does not constitute legal advice, and should not be relied on, since each state has different laws, each situation is fact specific, and it is impossible to evaluate a legal problem without a comprehensive consultation and review of all the facts and documents at issue.

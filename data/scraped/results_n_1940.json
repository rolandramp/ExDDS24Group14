        "Attorneys are expensive... if you can afford one, contact an attorney that can clean up credit. They can explain to you the consequences of each item--whether positive or negative.\nAlso, if you have a collection account--that means you owe someone money pursuant to a judgment. That alone makes you completely disreputable regardless of your score.",
        "Positive credit accounts which do not belong to you can actually have a negative impact on your credit report if they affect your use of credit-ratio or can make it harder for you to get a loan if it impacts your debt to income ratio. Plus positive accounts can turn negative if the owner stops making payments on them. I would dispute any accounts on your credit report which do not belong to you.",
        "Have you considered Bankruptcy? That would eliminate debt. Consult with a local AVVO bankruptcy attorney."

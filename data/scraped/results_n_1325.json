    "title": "I have to appear in January for a debt collection hearing, Is there anything I can do to postpone this? Will I need an atty?",
    "question": "Last summer, a major credit card co. filed suit for non-payment. I responded, noting that I had no steady source of income and had been temporarily disabled and was struggling to get back on my feet. I was assigned a court date for June 2016. However, the law firm filed a motion for discovery and after receiving my response, I now have to appear in in court in late January. Does this hearing replace the later one? Can I file some type of paperwork in response? If the creditor prevails at the January hearing, can they put a lien on my bank account?",

        "Your question is not clear, however having represented folk like you who have been sued by a credit card company, you should get to an attorney to give you a consultation as soon as possible. the credit card companies have an attorney and you need one also. I can not stress the importance of getting an attorney as soon as possible",
        "It is not clear from you question whether the hearing is on a pretrial motion, a motion for discovery compliance, to deem admissions admitted, motion for summary judgment, trial or judgment debtor examination. If it is a motion, you MUST file your responsive papers at least 9 court days before the hearing. If a judgment is entered, or sanctions imposed, your bank account can be levied upon immediately and without further notice. I strongly urge you to at least meet with an attorney who can review the documents and explain what is going on.",
        "It sounds like you have received a notice or supplemental proceedings for a post judgment debtors examination. You will need to provide requested documents and appear at the hearing. It is VERT important that you take the documents that you have received (all of them from over the months) to meet with an experienced consumer or bankruptcy attorney. They will be able to better able to give you quality legal advice on how to best proceed. Good Luck!",
        "If the creditor obtains a judgment against you, it can and will obtain a writ of execution and seize any of your assets it can legally reach. If this has been in litigation for months, have you contacted a credit counseling agency to structure a workout, or considered filing for bankruptcy? At this stage you need to consult an attorney, as soon as possible, to determine what your options are. I'm not sure if the hearing in January is for a motion to compel. If it is, that won't be the end of your case -- but you're clearly uncertain about what's happening to you and you need help sooner rather than later.",
        "It is unclear from your description what the January hearing is all about. If the hearing is a Debtor Examination hearing, then a judgment was entered against you somewhere along the way. If I am correct, then this hearing is to question you about your assets in an effort being made by the creditor to collect the judgment. Yet you say that you responded to the lawsuit. Did come in the form of filing a formal Answer or how was that done? It may also be that the January hearing is to prove up the plaintiff's case against you so as to obtain a judgment. There is not enough information provided to tell what is going on here.\n\nThat said, you really need to show the paperwork to an attorney who can advise as to how to respond and by when. Do not delay. Consult with an attorney now."

        "60% is not a bad deal, but like the other attorneys indicated, so much depends on the type of debt, etc. This time of year, a lot of creditors offer trying to catch the tax refunds. Many attorneys are limited by the settlement limits set by their clients. If you want to defend the action totally, even if an attorney can defeat the action in court and the matter is dismissed, doesn't mean down the road, someone else might not try and sue on the account, so if you do know you owe the debt, might be worth trying to settle, and a good attorney could help you come up with the best deal.",
        "Your first step is to meet with an attorney who regularly represents consumers in consumer debt collection cases. Pay for one hour of time. The attorney can evaluate your case, including possible defenses, the creditor's compliance with the Truth in Lending Act, and other issues. After that, it may be worthwhile to defend the lawsuit, or to negotiate.",
        "The cost to hire an attorney to defend you would depend upon various factors about the case, as well as each different attorneys' fee structure. Some attorneys do handle small debt collection cases on a flat-rate basis as oppose to charging you by the hour. You can get more information from each attorney as well as an opinion as to what defenses may be applicable in your case.\n\nBe sure to identify debt collection DEFENSE attorneys and consumer attorneys. You don't need a collection attorney.\n\nGood luck.",
        "It depends how much the total debt is. There are some attorneys who do debt defense for a flat fee, so that may be worth your while.",
        "The consensus of my colleagues can be summed up as follows: \"It depends\". Click the Avvo tab \"Find a Lawyer\". Many offer free consultations. Take them up on it.",
        "You need to decide whether its worth it to you to hire an attorney to perhaps get a better deal on resolving the debt. Most attorneys would charge hourly and some might do a flat fee for demand letter/negotiation. You can always counter offer the creditors offer to you and negotiate on your own. You want to make sure the credit card company does not obtain a judgment against you as this judgment could attach to your wages, any real property you may own, and/or bank accounts. Your other option would be filing bankruptcy, if you qualify, to wipe out all of your debt. Contact a couple attorneys as most give free consultations so you can make an informed decision on how to move forward.",
        "Information is missing in order to provide an answer. How much is the alleged debt? Who filed the lawsuit? When did you incur the debt? When did you make the last payment on the account? I strongly suggest that you consult with an attorney in this matter. Many attorneys provide some type of a limited free consultation. Please note that if you do nothing and do not file timely answer, the plaintiff may get a default judgment against for the entire amount alleged, plus cost and fees. It is advisable that either way you file a timely denial/answer with the court. But again, I strongly suggest that you consult with an attorney in this matter as soon as possible.",
        "You aren't really asking a question that would be appropriate to answer by an attorney. You have to decide if that deal is good for you. If that was the initial settlement by the credit card company, I would make a counter-offer. You haven't stated how much the debt is. Generally, if the debt is under $3000 in my area, the cost of obtaining an attorney wouldn't make sense. Good luck to you!",
        "The only way to find out what an attorney would charge is to visit some and get quotes. Normally consumer attorneys have a very high success rate defending these junk debt lawsuits, assuming that yours is one such case (big difference in junk debt buyer versus the original creditor suing you). Take the complaint to be reviewed by an experienced consumer attorney and ask them for their thoughts.",
        "I t really depends on the nature of the debt, who the creditor is, how much is at issue, and how far in the process the case goes. I charge $225.00 per hour to handle these cases and often the costs are $1200 or so to handle a case through resolution if no trial takes place. I think many attorneys have similar costs."

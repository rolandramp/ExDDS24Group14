    "title": "Can a civil case judgment lien be removed for chapter 7 or 13 ?",
    "question": "I am a landlord and experienced bad tenants who couldn't afford to pay rent anymore and they fabricated false accusations against me, and even a false verbal assault against me. They filed a lawsuit against me and won the case. They also filed a judgment lien to my property including legal fees. My question is, can a landlord tenant judgment lien be removed from my property if I file chapter 7 or 13? can any type of civil case judgment lien be removed from a property to include it in chapter 7 or 13? Thank you",

        "Judments liens can be avoided (or removed) in bankruptcy depending on the available exemptions, the value of the asset, and the debt enncumbering the asset.",
        "Yes - a judgment lien can be removed from your property during a BK depending on how much equity you have in your property. If your equity exceeds any exemptions you would be entitled to claim, the excess would reduce the amount of the lien you can avoid.",
        "Filing bankruptcy includes exempting your personal residence. Since you have a judgment against you which resulted in a lien being recorded against your property, the debt can be discharged but the lien will survive because the BK exemptions only apply to your personal residence."

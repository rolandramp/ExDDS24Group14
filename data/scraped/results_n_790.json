        "If you have not made a payment in over 4 years then if the Creditor sues you in court you will need to raise the defense of the \"Statute of Limitations\".

        "A lawsuit can be filed by almost anyone that wants to pay the filing fee. If they have a valid claim and there is no defense to it, they can collect.

If harassment by this creditor becomes an issue, seek legal advice. Keep track of what you are sent and make notes of what you are told over the phone. Get dates, times, names and phone numbers.",
        "You can raise the defense that it is beyond the statute of limitations. If you have other debts you can't pay you may want to look into bankruptcy. Good Luck!",
        "You are probably beyond the statue of limitations. Debt collectors are not known for high ethical standards or following the law. To properly answer your questions and address your concerns, the best way to handle this is with an in person consultation with an experienced CA bankruptcy attorney. Use AVVO's Find a Lawyer tool to select a qualified attorney. Good luck. THIS IS NOT LEGAL ADVICE! YOU NEED TO SPEAK TO AN ATTORNEY WHO IS LICENSED IN YOUR STATE FOR LEGAL ADVICE. This is merely suggestions for you to think about in discussing your situation with the local attorney."

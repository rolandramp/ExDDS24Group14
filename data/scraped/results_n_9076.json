    "title": "Unemployed single mom with debts that cannot be paid. Personal loan, student loans, etc.",
    "question": "I have been on enemployment for nearly a year. Single mother, 16k in consolidated student loans, 5k personal loan (due to divorce), and minor medical debts as well as old discharged credit card debts. I also have an eviction judgement, but that has been completely paid off, though remains on my credit report. I have no interest in my property any longer (thankfully as its underwater) and no other assests. However, with the cost of healthcare, auto mechanic visits, and erradic disbursement of UI checks (often 1-2 weeks late), I am unable to make any kind of payments to those debts as long as I am on UI. Would bankruptcy be a good option for me? Or just continue to field the calls from the creditors?",

        "The problem with bankruptcy is that you are unlikely to be able to satisfy the requirements to discharge your student loans. Before filing for bankruptcy, you should first apply for a hardship discharge of your student loans, if they are government guaranteed. The first two links below are good resources and there are forms to complete that you will do well to send by certified mail, return receipt requested and keep copies of everything with your postal receipts.\n\nIf that does not work, you may want to consult with an attorney who has experience in successfully discharging student loans in bankruptcy. The third link is to consumer lawyers, which you can search by specialty, such as bankruptcy, in your area.",
        "I'm not clear what you mean by \"discharged credit card debts\", so I can't address that. Regarding the student loan, which seems to be by far your largest debt, unless you're able to show \"undue hardship\", student loans are not dischargeable in bankruptcy. From what you say, though, it may be possible to get the student loan discharged in bankruptcy as an undue hardship. Note that I said \"may\", not \"can\". You'd need to consult with a qualified bankruptcy attorney in your area to have any chance at all of achieving that."

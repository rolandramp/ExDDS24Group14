        "Generally the statute of limitations on written contracts in California is four years, however some payday loan contacts have statute of limitations waivers, which may or may not be enforceable. Was the payday loan entered into while you resided in California?\n\nThis could quite possibly be a scam. Threats of jail time and warrants should be an automatic red flag whenever you hear a debt collector make such threats. You may have rights to pursue legal action against the debt collection agency, and I would suggest you consult a consumer protection attorney in your area. The National Association of Consumer Advocates (www.naca.net) has several attorneys in California and across the country whose practices are focused on this type of work.",
        "I agree with Mr. Spaulding. In addition, note that the statute of limitations on a written agreement (promissory note) is four years, and two years if oral. No one is going to sue you on a nine-year-old debt, particularly one of only $500. This collector is lying to you to frighten you into paying him / it $250 for nothing. Heed Mr. Spaulding's recommendations and report this drip.",
        "You absolutely CANNOT and WILL NOT have a warrant issued for your arrest or face any sort of criminal penalties for failure to pay this payday loan back. Next time that scumbag debt collector calls you, get the name of the company he works for and his name (be polite so that he will provide this info) and then call a competent consumer protection or bankruptcy attorney in your area so that you can file a FDCPA or RFDCPA suit against them. This is likely a case that an attorney will take on with no out-of-pocket costs to you."

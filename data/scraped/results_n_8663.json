        "I agree with my colleague Kenneth. Also keep in mind that probates are generallly monitored closely by the court, so the executor is usually held accountable regarding distributions etc. If you have any concerns, you can hire a lawyer to represent you at an upcoming hearing and you can bring up your concerns to the court. Generally, the will's instructions are to be followed regardless of whether or not the distributions are equitable. Also, before a probate can be concluded, an executor generally has to show the court what they've done so it can all be approved by the court."

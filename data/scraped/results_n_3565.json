    "title": "Can a lawyer send an unpaid invoice to a collection agency without fee arbitration I am requesting?",
    "question": "I told my former attorney I wanted to arbitrate fees. She's had it in writing from me for quite some time. Her bill was $28,000 of which $17,000 I paid. Instead of sending me a letter saying that I have the right to fee arbitration she sent the bill to a collection agency. I told the collection agency that she needed to send me a form saying that I have the right to arbitrate fees. The collection agency is ignoring this continues to call me. What do I do? This is just my former attorney's way of getting back at me for requesting fee arbitration and instead just wants to damage my credit rather than risk going before the board to show that she gouged me on fees.",

        "You need to hire an attorney to represent you. The law in this area is technical and depending upon how the attorney billed..etc you may be able to void the bill. The collection agency should stop once u get a lawyer and formally start the process.",
        "You can start the arbitration process. Contact the LA County Bar, or whichever bar is located where the matter took place. Get the rules regarding arbitration. And arbitrate the amount. Do this right away.\n\nLawyers have another problem in suing for fees. In addition to being required to give notice of your right to arbitrate, many malpractice insurance companies ask whether the attorney sues for fees. This is because in more than half the cases, a lawsuit for fees will be met with a counter suit for malpractice. The Statute of Limitations for attorney malpractice is short, so if you have such a claim, you better get on it right now. If you have an attorney tell your former attorney that a malpractice case is about to be filed, the whole thing may be resolved without any court or arbitration.",
        "I honestly can't say if she's violating any law or your agreement. The debt collector could be seeing if you will pay the fees prior to arbitration (slim chance). All I can recommend is to handle things in writing with the debt collector and dispute the debt. You would want to provide a copy of the arbitration agreement. You can also try calling the attorney and have them explain why they went to a debt collector when you have an enforceable agreement.",
        "Depending on where the lawyer is, OC or LA you can just send the form to the local bar association and they will contact her to arbitrate. If she refuses to respond, contact the CA bar and let them know what is going on."

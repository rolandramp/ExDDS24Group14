    "title": "The timeshare loss mitigation says our debt will disappear with Dh Ch7 even though my name is on the deed.Does this sound right?",
    "question": "My husband is filing Bankruptcy. The only debt in both of our names is the special assessments for our timeshare so we did not add my name to the bankruptcy. The timeshare's loss mitigation is telling me that the debt will discharge from both of us, but this sounds a little too good to be true. Have you heard of this being true? The company we're dealing with is Diamond Resorts International. Thanks!",

        "What did your husband's attorney say? Or does he not have an attorney?\n\nBasically, it's true. Your husband's personal liability will be discharged, and the \"community property\" 's liability will be discharged. So as long as you remain (1) married to your husband, AND (2) living in California (or perhaps other community property states), that creditor cannot come after your income because your income is community property (assuming you two don't have a prenup saying you're not following community property law in your marriage).\n\nHOWEVER, if you now have, or receive in the future, any \"separate property\" (for example, property you brought to the marriage, or property received via inheritance), such property is in fact fair game for the creditor; this is also why the \"hypothetical discharge\" does not apply any longer if you get divorced or if your husband dies or if you move into a separate property state.\n\nAlso, and perhaps this is obvious, your credit rating will take a hit for the default with that creditor (but not for a bankruptcy). Of course, \"saving\" your right to file your own bankruptcy in the future is a huge benefit for you (your husband will be barred from filing another chapter 7 for 8 years).\n\nFeel free to call me for further clarification.

        "Lots of times, creditors will make a decision not to pursue a debt owed jointly by spouses when one has filed bankruptcy, even if the other has not filed.

Hope this perspective helps!",
        "More than likely they will not pursue you since you will receive the benefit of a \"phantom discharge\". In other words, since you are in a community property state and your husband will have included all of your income &u assets in his petition, the creditor will see that you are essentially judgment proof by virtue of your husband's bk.",

        "Do not take offense. The paralegal and your attorney need to do their best to understand your financial situation, to prepare you for examination by the trustee and to help keep you out of trouble. The question, what happened to the money?, could easily be asked by the Trustee. It is best to find out the answer before you file bankruptcy. There are many ways in which your answer could be relevant. For example, if you gave a large part of the money to a relative to repay a debt, the Trustee could see your relative to get the money back. If, as you say, you spent the money on expenses, the Trustee may want a more detailed explanation regarding what those expenses were. Things like groceries and gasoline sound better then ski trips, expensive clothes, and jewelry.\n\nIf everything appears normal, you will be able to go forward with your bankruptcy filing. If there is a problem, delaying your bankruptcy filing may be the right answer.",
        "The question is what happened to the money. If you paid back relatives, you might have a problem. If you hid the assets, you will have a problem. If you lived off the money, you will most likely not have a problem. The ability to document is the key.

        "The paralegal needs to ask you these questions about where the money in your brokerage account was spent in order to prepare your case & to also prepare you for the questions that your Bankruptcy Trustee will ask you. As long as you can answer the questions honestly & can verify the answers with your financial records, I don't see that you have a problem.\n\nPeople who are having financial problems usually dip into their savings in order to pay their living expenses. Part of the bankruptcy process is to have you explain how you got into financial trouble. I suggest that you are sensitive about having to undergo this embarassing process and want to lash out at someone. Unfortunately, chosing the paralegal as your target is not a smart move - the paralegal can be your best friend & can keep you from harm from the Bankruptcy process. Listen to what the paralegal & your attorney are trying to tell you & prepare yourself for this ordeal. It will soon be over.\n\nGood luck & God Bless you!"

    "title": "I received a warrant of debt through forwarded mail. I left Chesapeake, VA last Oct 2016? How can I answer the court?",
    "question": "I always pay my credit card debt every month since 2012. Since Oct 2016 I really had a hard time and don't have a job. So I called a debt relief program and started Nov 2016. Until recently I received a mail from a law firm that they are suing me for my debt, and I need to be on court on June 5, but I was out of the country visiting a family. In the letter it stated it was mailed on May 3, 2017. I left CA on May 17 and haven't receive the letter. Only when I came back that I read the letter.",

        "Good information has been provided by my colleagues. If you had a bankruptcy attorney representing you in your case, you may want to discuss the issue with the attorney. If not, consult with one to discuss all options. Unfortunately, the collateral belongs to the creditor since no action was taken in the bankruptcy case to provide a different result.",
        "If the credit card had valid security in the CD, the bankruptcy did not effect their right to that security. Your discharge prevented them from pursuing you personally, but they can still demand to enforce their lien: ie payment from the CD.\nIf you need to find out further information, you should discuss the issue with your bankruptcy attorney. If you filed without an attorney, you might want to talk with one now, to verify your rights.",
        "Atty Firth is correct. The reason you rec'd the credit card is because the creditor wanted a \"no risk\" transaction. But what does your BK lawyer say? No lawyer? There may be other nuances, but from what you disclosed you won't prevail. I'm surprised that the creditor did not just use the CD to pay off the debt after your case was closed and the discharge entered. Obviously, you are entitled to any surplus after the debt is paid off.",
        "It was a secured debt. The bank gets the security when you walked away from the debt. Same as a loan secured by a car. The lender on the car gets the car in a bankruptcy."

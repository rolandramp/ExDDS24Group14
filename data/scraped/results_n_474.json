        "I agree with my colleagues. You cannot apply the homestead exemption to a property you are not occupying. Make sure to factor in the cost of the sale. If the equity, minus the cost of the sale, is around the amount of the wildcard exemption, then you may be able to use that to protect the equity in your rental property, assuming you do not have other assets that would be at risk if you used the entire wildcard exemption to protect the rental property. You also need to make sure your income passes the mean's test, since I am assuming you have rental income and employment income. I would speak with an experienced bankruptcy attorney right away to make sure chapter 7 is the way to go.",
        "You may be able to exempt the equity in the house by applying the 30.825 wild card exemption but you need to consult with a bankruptcy attorney immediate;y to determine what other assets you may have which also need to be exempted.",
        "Does your estimate of equity include the costs of sale?\nIf not, then the realizable equity may be exemptable with the 30,825 wildcard, assuming you don't need it for other assets.",
        "You need to occupy the property you are claiming a homestead exemption on. Consult with an attorney ASAP. You will place your home at risk."

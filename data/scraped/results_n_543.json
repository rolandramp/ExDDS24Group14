        "You will need to speak about in your financial situation in depth with some attorneys before you can decide which option is best for you. I agree with my colleagues that you may be able to strip the 2nd mortgage if the value of the home is less than what you owe on the 1st mortgage. This would happen in a Chapter 13 Bankruptcy. Chapter 13 also allows you to eliminate other unsecured debt depending on your gross income and any other assets. If you file Chapter 7, assuming you qualify, you can wipe out unsecured debts. You will not be personally liable for the 2nd mortgage anymore with a Chapter 7 discharge, however, the 2nd mortgage would still retain a lien on your property giving them the ability to foreclosure in the future. Definitely call some experienced attorneys to understand which option is best for you.",
        "Depending on the numbers analysis, it is possible to file a BK 13 and do what is called a \"lien strip\". You need to set up a phone consultation with a BK lawyer.\n\nRemember, BK is more than checking boxes on forms you find online. Find/consult/hire a lawyer using the Avvo feature \"Find a Lawyer\". Make a list of 4-5 having many 5 star reviews from satisfied clients. If you don't get a prompt call back from one, go on to the next on your list. Some of us offer a free consultation by phone or in person. Take us up on it.\n\nBecause the bankruptcy process can be handled entirely by phone, email and fax, there is no need to personally visit the lawyer’s office unless you want to. Don’t be limited by the location of the BK lawyers you select. Some of the atty fee can be paid thru the Chapter 13 Plan so you don't necessarily have to come up with the fee all at once.",
        "A second trust deed is a security interest on your home. A bankruptcy only releases you from personal liability, but the lien still remains unless you do something else.",
        "I agree with attorney Larkin. I've done it a couple of times but the facts have to line up just perfectly.",
        "If the current value of your home is worth less than what you owe on the first mortgage you can wipe out the second mortgage via a Chapter 13 bankruptcy and still keep the home. You can also catch up on any missed mortgage payments on the first as well and eliminate other unsecured debts depending on certain criteria. You should speak with an attorney for further information. Most offer free consultations."

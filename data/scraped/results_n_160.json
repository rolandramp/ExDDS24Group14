    "title": "Tricked into signing trust amend & removed as a trustee. Trust papers withheld, missed hearing & unaware of chg. Any recourse?",
    "question": "I was mislead when asked to sign a document for my moms trust. I just recently discovered that I was removed as a successor trustee. My mom then had the trust papers with hearing date sent to her home instead of mine and she withheld the papers so I was unaware of change and missed hearing. I found papers in her papers few days ago. She is still alive. But she did this 3 yrs ago. The paper I signed was a consent to modification of trust. I was told this was to modify trust for tax reasons. I never received notice of hearing or the trust. What happened was I was removed as successor trustee and trust amended with some special distribution clauses that I in no way would agree to. (release health records to a family member I do not trust or they may withhold money). I was lied to and deceived intentionally to give my brother full control of me and my daughter. This is not acceptable to me and not what my father wanted when original trust was set up. He is deceased. I am not sure how to proceed. But again, giving control to my brother is not acceptable, we have no relationship and he has proven untrustworthy.",

    "title": "What does \"Estate fully administered\" in a chapter 7 Bankruptcy proceeding mean?",
    "question": "Hello, I am the creditor in a Chapter 7 Bankruptcy. Recently there was an entry by the trustor, \"I have made a diligent inquiry...and that there is no property available for distribution from the estate over and above that exempted by law. Pursuant to FRBP 5009, I hereby certify that the estate of the debtor(s) has been fully administered. I request that I be discharged from any further duties as trustee... Assets Abandoned $500, Assets Exempt: Not Available, Claims Scheduled: $1,200,000, Claims Asserted: Not Applicable, Claims scheduled to be discharged without payment: $1,200,000\"",

        "Was this a Northern California case? They do things a bit differently up there. The Notice you saw is a standard notice that Chapter 7 Trustees (not \"trustors\") file when they are not going to administer any assets. This is also known as the \"no-asset report\".\n\nThere are two main reasons I can guess as to why it would subsequently be closed without discharge a week after that report is filed. The first is that the debtor may not have been eligible for a discharge because they had filed a prior Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 case (and received a discharge) within a certain number of years prior to filing the present case. The other reason might be that the debtor simply failed to take the required post-filing debt management course and file the certificate (which can easily be remedied). However, these both seem unlikely if the case was closed only a week after the Trustee filed his/her no-asset report. I'd need to see the exact dates and the docket in the case to figure it out.\n\nMark J.

        "I practice in the Northern District and am puzzled by this. If there was a complaint to deny discharge, the clerks wouldn't have closed the case. The easiest way to figure it out is to call the court clerk's office, give them the case number and ask what happened. The failure to give a discharge after a 'No Asset\" statement makes no sense to me.",
        "I'm confused too. You need to check the docket to see if a discharge was entered previously because logically it should have been and I will bet a dollar to a donut that it was entered."

    "title": "Wage garnishment for an Independent contractor who has an S-Corp on a 1099.",
    "question": "I am an Independent contractor that provides services that are invoiced monthly for diffierent busnesses. I was contacted at one of the office by a 4 year old pay or quit (my daughter and I signed) case for the remaining balance approximately 3 weeks ago for $2000. I was told that I had to pay $1000 by end of month or my wages would be garnished. Is that possible with an independent contractor with S-corp? I am not an employee of the office. Should it be served to my Corporation?",

        "If you are an \"employee\", a wage garnishment can take up to 25% of your wages. If you are an independent contractor, it can take 100% of what is due to you!",
        "I agree with what others have said and only add an observation or two. If there is judgment, it would be against your corporation from the facts you relate (if you personally guaranteed the lease there is likely a judgment against you as well). If it is against the corp, your wages cannot be garnished. Funds due th corp. could be garnished. However, I suspect there is no money judgment. SInce it is a four year old obligation, this collection agency is probably just trying to wring some money out of old debts about to go past the statute of limitations. If they had a judgment they would be in a better position and would not be under a time crunch. Of cours, if they still have some time and think there is someone to pay it, they could still file for the money and most leases have attorneys' fees provisions. To protect yourself, it would be wise to retain an attorney now. If you are in more of a gambling mood, wait to see if you are actually sued to take it to an attorney. In the meantime, check to see if there are any judgments against you or your company.",
        "Your facts are not clear. Do you have a judgment against you for $2000? Or for $1000? Or is the remaining balance on an obligation $1000?\n\nIf you have no wages they cannot be garnished. However, if you are individually liable for an obligation your assets, such as your bank accounts, can be levied upon to satisfy a judgment. The bill collector may just be blowing hot air unless there is an outstanding judgment against you.\n\nIn California many unlawful detainer judgments are for possession only and the landlord never pursues a judgment for money. Do a little research, if necessary, to determine if there is an outstanding judgment. If not the bill collector cannot do anything until a judgment for money is obtained. That may be impossible at this late date. If contacted further, you could ask for a copy of the judgment which would make your research substantially easier. Good luck.",
        "There are ways to grab your cash flow. Garnishment is only one that relates to wages. If you have a business with cash flow, a good collections attorney will be able to take that cash flow. It might be that the person demanding the money used the term garnishment loosely. It might be that the person has not consulted with an experienced collections attorney.\n\nGood luck to you."

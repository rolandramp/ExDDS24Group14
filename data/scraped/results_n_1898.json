    "question": "Can I use wild card exemption to exempt $5,000 from judgment creditor. The judgment is from the the old credit card debt and with interest is about $20,000. The $5,000 is savings from work.",
    "answers": [
        "The wildcard exemption you refer to is found under the CA 703 exemptions. 703 exemptions are not available outside of a bankruptcy scenario. If you will not be filing bankruptcy, you'll need to protect assets using the 704 exemptions only. Under that set of exemptions, your money in the bank would be at risk. If you won't be filing bk, your creditor may settle with you and/or accept some form of a payment plan. Either way, hiring a good attorney will likely save you a lot of money and help eliminate additional problems.",

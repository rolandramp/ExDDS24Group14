    "title": "Am I able to sue someone for non payment of a $300 cash loan which they promised to pay but refused to repay when asked?",
    "question": "My babysitter asked for $300 which she promised to repay over a period of a couple of months. So I gave her the $300 that she had asked for on the condition she would pay it back. When the time was due to repay the $300 she said she doesn't have the money and does not intend to repay what she owes me.",

If you can find a way to to a screen capture and print the messages, that would be the best way to handle this.",
        "I agree with both attorney's, yes you can sue her unless she is a minor. You have to determine whether it is worth the hassle.",
        "You do not need a written agreement to sue someone for non-payment, but it certainly removes a lot of doubt if she says \"What $300?\" Print out the text messages and hope for the best. Maybe she'll pay when the sheriff shows up at her door with the Summons. Good luck.",
        "yes you can sue in small claims.",
        "Just out of curiosity ... is the babysitter a minor (under 18)?\nIf so, your verbal \"contract\" is voidable by her."

    "title": "Can debt collectors put a lien on the house or sue me?",
    "question": "My grandma made me executor of her revocable trust. She since has passed away and left her house to my mom (her daughter) and I. It has already been transferred out of the trust and the deed now only has both our names. Are her creditors able to put a lien on the house or sue for their money? Grandma left about $15,000 in credit card and loan debt. The only valuable thing in the trust was the home and we are still paying that off. We don’t have any money to pay her other debts. Also, will a refinance or selling of the home be affected with debt collectors lingering?",

        "You could attempt a cash out refinance for some money and then use that to pay the creditors. You could also negotiate the total debt with each one to a lower amount, most will routinely do that for you in exchange for cash without a court action on their part. To be frank, like most creditors they will either go away after time or sue to collect - my hunch, based on the size of the debt, is that they will ultimately go away. To be sure of your options, consult directly with a lawyer.",
        "A trustee has a duty to pay estate debts. Any interested party can open a probate to collect debt. The probate court will order the estate to pay the attorney fees and the probate fees. Probate fees are a percentage of the total estate, which includes the FMV of the house. So the cost of probate is paid by the estate.\nConsult with a probate attorney.",
        "The creditor will have to open a probate and file a lawsuit against the \"estate\". If the estate has no assets, their judgment will not be able to be enforced.

        "I agree with Attorney Firth. Unless a single creditor is owed most of the debt, aggressive, and willing to risk great legal expense, I doubt the creditor will bother suing. But, because legal jargon can be confusing, here’s some explanation, if it helps. Technically, a trust alone cannot be sued. The person administering the trust is called a “trustee,” not executor. If there is a claim against the trust, the trustee can be sued. If there is no trustee, the court ordered remedy of a constructive trust orders the person who would otherwise be unjustly enriched to transfer the property to the intended party.",
        "Creditors (most creditors anyway) can't lien the house without suing the trust, getting a judgment, then suing to put a constructive trust on the house. I doubt if the creditors would go to that expense unless ti was one particularly aggressive creditor who was owed the bulk of the debt."

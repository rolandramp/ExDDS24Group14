        "What may happen is that the debtor will be given a court date and if she fails to appear at that court date, another warrant may be issued. Did the first warrant include a bail amount? sometimes the bail is set at $50. or some very small amount. If the debtor keeps failing to appear, the amount of bail will be increased. Then, you may get your ORAP.",
        "If the Police/Sheriff refuse to honor the court order, there is not a lot that you an do. I do not know what this was the case. Usually, the sheriff/police will take them to jail for a hearing or to court for an immediate hearing.

        "That is typical.

If the debtor is ever pulled over, a police officer may arrest her (I highly doubt it). The warrant will show up on back ground checks and what not. But face it, you have lost this battle. You still have the upper hand in the war, with the judgement, but you lost this round.\n\nYou claim she \"has money.\" How do you know that if you can't find it? If you know she has money, then go after THAT money."

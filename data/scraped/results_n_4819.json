    "title": "Conversion to Chapter 13 when Chapter 7 objection to dischargeabilty filed",
    "question": "I filed chapter 7. One of my creditors filed an objection based on fraud. We can't reach a settlement. Can I convert my Ch. 7 case to one under 13 to avoid this objection, or will I have to defend the objection while I'm in Ch. 13?",
    "answers": [
        "The short answer is Yes, you can. The unknown answer is how the creditor or the Court will react, and whether or not you really need to convert to deal with the fraud complaint. Perhaps the complaint is defensible? Like another colleague said, just because they alleged it does not mean they will win, they have to have a viable case. If they do, then there may be other alternatives including a conversion. But it's by no means a \"slam dunk\" or easy to deal with. You should definitely speak with an attorney who can get the whole story and understand the situation and come up with a strategy for you.",
        "Again like another attorney has said, we here do not know enough about your case by your question. A creditor can file an objection and usually they file it as fraud. You did not state the basis of the fraud allegation. Just claiming fraud does not make it true. They sometimes claim fraud for expenses just before filing the petition. But that does not automatically make it fraud, there are exceptions to fraud (such as non-luxury, necessity). You need to respond, you need a qualified attorney. Unfortunately many bankruptcy attorneys simply mass file Ch 7s and do not handle more advanced bankruptcy matters. Converting to a 13 may not be appropriate and depending on the fraud may cause problems even in Ch 13. Going about ch 13 alone will spell disaster.\nFind an attorney who knows about advanced bankruptcy practices, and adversary proceedings. You simply stated can you convert if a creditor files fraud charges, with nothing else to go on it is difficult to give you a proper answer.",
        "You will have to defend the objection under any scenario where you are trying to discharge some or all of that debt.",
        "No one knows anything about your case, and you should certainly have a lawyer with such serious matters pending. That is who answers your questions. If a conversion was a loophole to avoid the discharge complaint, everyone would try it. You need a lawyer badly.",
        "When you convert a 7 to 13 you will have to submit a payment plan and you will have to describe how much you will pay your creditors. If the objecting creditor is to be paid in full, you will avoid the fraud suit. If your plan provides less than is owed to the creditor, you can expect them to object to the conversion.",

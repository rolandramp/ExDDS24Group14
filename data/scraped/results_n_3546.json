        "Portfolio Recovery is a debt buyer. If you look at the complaint it should list somewhere in it who the original creditor was. However, your statement says you received a \"letter\". A letter is not a lawsuit. It sounds like they are just threatening to sue, and they will likely get around to it eventually. You can also send them a letter disputing the debt. Do this within 30 days. Look closely at the letter. It may have the warning that if you do not dispute it within 30 days it is assumed to be correct. So, disputing it helps preserve your rights. In that letter demand proof of the debt.\nIf you did receive a Summons and Complaint then you need to file an answer with the court within 30 days from when you were served.\n\nHope that helps."

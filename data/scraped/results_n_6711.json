    "title": "Is counsel allowed during Judgment Debtor Examinations?",
    "question": "Well, it may not exactly be a judgment debtor examination, but I may have to appear before a judge due to the opposition of an Earnings Withholding Order. I, as the judgment creditor, filed a Writ of Execution for an EWO against the debtor. The debtor has opposed the Writ and filed a Claim of Exemption. I am opposing it due to the fact that she stated she was paying far more for her expenses than she really is, which I can verify. I understand we will most likely have to appear before a judge to discuss this. I want to know if she is allowed to have a legal counsel present, as the attorney she used in a Small Claims appeal she filed against us contacted me and informed me I had no right to contact the debtor, but had to contact him instead. Can he do that? And is he able to be present?",

Otherwise, you may contact the debtor directly if the purpose of the communication relates directly to court proceedings. If the attorney, or the debtor, notifies you in writing, not to communicate directly with the debtor, you cannot dun the debtor directly, you must communicate duns through the attorney.",
        "If the small claims appeal is over and he has not filed in the case you are dealing with, and if she filed the opposition herself (pro se), why would you contact the former counsel?"

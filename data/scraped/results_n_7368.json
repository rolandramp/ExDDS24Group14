        "Greetings.\n\nTypically the tolling of the statute of limitations becomes a consideration when a party wants to sue or has been sued. In California, it is atypical for a second lien-holder to sue a delinquent borrower. The process of pursuing litigation against a borrower is expensive and in many cases unlikely to result in a meaningful recovery (due to Bankruptcy).\n\nHowever, assuming the property is not sold in a foreclosure auction by the first lien-holder and you are able to re-instate the first mortgage when you become financially stable, the second lien will not go away. If the second lien has been recorded and is secured by your property, the only means to remove that lien are as follows: 1) Pay off the debt entirely; 2) Settle the debt in exchange for a release of lien; 3) a lien-strip through Chapter 13 Bankruptcy.\n\n\n\nBest,\n\nSwazi E.

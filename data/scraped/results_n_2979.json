    "question": "I am a respondent to a request to modify spousal support in California. The trial is Nov 19. I just received a notice of lieu of subpoena demand for production of documents. The documents they are requesting are:",

        "The requests must be specific. For example, Bank of America statement for July, 2014. Asking for all documents to prove an issue is not specific. You only have five days to file an objection or it is waived",
        "The little bit of the requests that you quoted sounds specific enough to me. If you can read it and know what they want, and it does not require you to try to interpret their intent, then it is not overly-broad. In this case, bills showing debts as of the DoS would satisfy the demand, wouldn't it? (It's a fairly routine request/demand in a divorce.)",
        "I can't answer this as I would need to read the whole discovery request. Your attorney is your best bet on this. But is this a \"hearing\" while a divorce matter is going on or is this a post judgment request for a hearing?",
        "You are required to make good faith efforts to produce documents, and the notice to produce has to allege that you have the materials. The operative statute is CCP 1987(c). If you can't or don't want to do it, you have a very short time to serve objections, and then the other party can sask the court for an order compelling production. This is a very technical area - get specific legal advice, or you can get your tail in a wringer."

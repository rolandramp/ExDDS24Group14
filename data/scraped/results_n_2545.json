    "question": "I am a single individual who owns his own home. I am 54 years old and I am employed. My daughter (23 yrs old) and my granddaughter (4 yrs old) both live with me. I support both of them. Even though I am not married, would I qualify for the $100,000 homestead of just the $75,000?",

        "Maybe. Carefully review CA CCP 704.730 and 704.710, which control homestead exemption and definition. Keep in mind:\n-you must have lived in CA for greater part of past 2 years to use CA homestead exemption.\n-Homestead exemption based on qualification of child and grandchild as part of your \"family unit\".\nCarefully review all facts with BK counsel before proceeding.",
        "All of the previous answers have given you excellent information on why this is a very tricky & risky area of the law, and why you definitely should consult with a local bankruptcy attorney to review your entire financial situation and to determine if a bankruptcy is your best choice or not, and to identify all of the risks.\n\nKeeping all that in mind, the basic answer to your specific question is that you would probably qualify for the $100,000 exemption since your daughter and grand-daughter, assuming they are not on title to the property, would be viewed as a \"family unit\". Being a part of such family unit in your household would allow for the higher exemption. It is not necessary for you to be married.",
        "NO attorney alive can answer your question w/o knowing more information which you might add to your facts. The threshold question is HAVE YOU LIVED IN CA for at least 2 years? If not, then another states laws may govern unless you lived in CA in the years before also..and hence an attorney must proceed with knowing where you have lived and for how long before they can answer. Now all attorneys on here try hard and I am sure their answers assume that you have lived in CA for 2 years but you must let them know. Then follow the CA attorneys comments on homestead exemptions. I would sit down with an experienced bankruptcy attorney and then know your answer for sure. There are other issues in bankruptcy though that can affect your case too.\n\nYou need and want to enjoy your fresh start also. But the most important thing is to meet with an attorney as you asking this question means you have not. You care about 2 goals: keeping everything you have equity in and discharging all your debts. If you don't have any of the exceptions to discharge you will obtain that goal; most exceptions are set forth in 11 USC. 523 (Google it) like child support, some income taxes, traffic (in a ch 7) and criminal fines , and presumption of student loans. But some debts are dischargeable in a ch 13 but NOT in a ch 7 so you want to make sure and your attorney will discuss any such types with you also!\n\nYour exemptions depend on what state you have lived in in the last 2 years as I stated above and thus if in your state, then your states exemptions will apply. Most persons filing keep everything they own but your attorney will confirm that with you when they learn everything you own and the equity thereof!\n\nSome secured debts like homes, vehicles, other secured debts an attorney will discuss your options on also as you must list any debts; but that does not mean you will lose them unless you have too much equity or are in default on paying for them! Discuss those options if they apply with your attorney too.\n\nBut other issues can arise that can greatly harm your case. Just one example: If you paid back a relative $3,000 11 months ago and now file bankruptcy next week, the trustee can SUE that relative to retrieve that $3,000 (under what is called a preference) for the benefit of the bankruptcy estate. As a result, most attorneys don't charge to meet with them the first meeting so meet with one no matter what.\n\nMany great attorneys can be found right here on AVVO in your state so look, call, and meet one as soon as you can.\n\nYou should also want to know when to file: is there an advantage of waiting versus filing now and who should you pay between now and then! Good luck and enjoy your later fresh start.",
        "Take a look at CA 704.730 and 704.710, which are the homestead exemption and definition section. Be very careful about pushing the limits of your exemptions.

Trustees will scrutinize whether you can claim the full $100k, and they can object to your using the exemption. They can also contest the market value of the home and seek independent appraisals.\n\nKeep in mind that you can also factor in the costs of selling a home, but please go see an attorney to have your situation reviewed carefully.

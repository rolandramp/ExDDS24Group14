    "title": "What is a Memorandum of Costs after judgement, acknowledgement of credit, and declaration of Accrued interest?",
    "question": "I just rec'd the notice in the mail. It looks like a notice to collect $$ on case judgement. I've not received any court docs, subpoena to appear in court, or notice that I am being sued by a creditor. I've heard that some of the collection agencies are using these tactics to scare people into paying on their debts. I am not familiar with the legal system but at the same time don't want any problems with the laws. I would be grateful for guidance on this.",

        "What you have received, often referred to as a Cost Memorandum, can only be filed in a civil lawsuit after a judgment has been rendered. If you have no prior information that a lawsuit was commenced against you, you are probably the victim of what is sometimes referred to as \"sewer service\", a New York slang term referring to the unethical and illegal practice of process servers who throw the summons and complaint intended to be served on a defendant instead down the sewer grate, and then fill out a proof of service claiming the summons and complaint were personally served upon the defendant.\n\nWhile you have the right to file a motion in the court where the judgment has been entered to have the default judgment set aside based upon the lack of proper service, it may not be worth the time and expense if you do not also have a defense to the claim, such as the debt is not yours or has been paid. The lack of ability to pay one's debts does not constitute a defense.\n\nIf the debt is one of many with which you are confronted, and yet you simply lack the ability to pay, you may wish to consider seeking protection under the bankruptcy laws.

    "question": "I had a debt collection case against me and I agreed to a settlement agreement but then I defaulted on that settlement agreement And now online my case shows as default pending. I wanted to know what does the lawyer for the debt collector have to do next to execute on the default? I'm trying to get an idea of how much time I might have to figure out how to pay this debt off.... What will I see next after Default Pending online? Will the next info online show something like Lawyer executing on default or something like that? And what happens after that? And how long after a default shows as pending will action be taken?",

        "Once a request for default has been filed, the next step would be for the Clerk to enter a Default Judgement. If/when that is entered, the Plainitiff will still need to try to collect the judgement from you, i,e., wage garnishment, bank levy, and/or a lien on any property you may own.",
        "It depends on the Court, how busy the Clerks are, and how long ago the Default was filed. However, I would suspect you should see the status updated within a week or two to show that a Default and a Judgment have been entered. After that, the timing of further actions depends on how the aggressive Judgment Creditor decides to be in enforcing the Judgment.",
        "It is impossible to say how long you have. Generally, once a default is requested, the next thing noted on a court docket would be that the default was entered, followed by a judgment.\nAfter that, you might see enforcement commence, such as judgment debtor exams, writ of execution, notice of levy, etc.\nThat is all assuming that you do nothing and just let it all happen.\nIf you owe the money, all the collection company wants is to get paid. Pay them. They will almost always agree to different payment arrangements as long as you keep paying.\nIf you don't want to pay, you may want to look into bankruptcy. Contact some attorneys for more help.",
        "They will then either get the clerk to give them a judgment or set it for hearing and get a judgment. They can then request a writ be issued and then collected. Could be days could be months depending on the law firm."

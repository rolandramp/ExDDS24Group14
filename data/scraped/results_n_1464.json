        "You are required to list all your creditors on your bankruptcy petition. However, if the debt is disputed, you can always specify that the particular debt is disputed and can dispute it in your bankruptcy case in the event a proof of claim is filed by the Creditor.",
        "You have an obligation to list all creditors. After filing, you would need permission of the court to remove a creditor.\nIf you fail to list a creditor when filing, that creditor is not subject to the automatic stay since they don't get notice of the filing. If you pay off a creditor before filing, you may have created a preference where the trustee may wish to recover the payment to the creditor. You should seek advice of an experienced bankruptcy attorney.",
        "Unfortunately you can not remove a debt in your 13. If the debt was paid prior to the filing of the 13 you may remove it as you no longer owe it. However if you are attempting to remove it simply because you want to pay them separately or you don't want it involved in your chapter 13 that can not be done.",
        "No. The law requires you to list all of your assets and all of your debts. I can't imagine a scenario where it would be to your advantage to not to include a creditor since it is illegal to do that.",
        "You could amend your plan to change whether a creditor is paid, but doing this will require court approval. In any bankruptcy, you must make full disclosure and obey all bankruptcy laws. Hope this perspective helps.",
        "Justin is right, all debt must be listed. However, if you have decided that you cannot afford to pay a debt that you are paying to retain a particular item which is collateral for a loan, you may be able to file a motion to modify the plan surrendering the collateral and reducing your plan payment. You will probably be required to file an amended schedule I & J showing the reduction in income or increase in expenses that caused the need to modify.",
        "Debtors are required to disclose and list all debts. If they amend their case to show they don't owe a creditor, it must be because they know they don't owe the debt."

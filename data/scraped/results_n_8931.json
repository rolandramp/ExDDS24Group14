    "title": "Can I sue my ex-husband for credit card debt if he files Chapter 13?",
    "question": "Ex-wife and I divorced 3 years ago and split everything. She kept one of our joint CCs and notified the bank of our divorce. The bank said they will take care of it. Ex-wife, thinking the card was solely hers, incurred 70k in credit card debt. I learned that my name is still in the card when the bank notified me. I closed the account since and ex-husband has been paying the monthly on time; however, I learned that he plans to file for Chapter 13, which means his credit card debt will be absolved. Will this mean the credit card company will come after me? Can I personally collect from ex-husband or sue him for non-payment even after he filed for Chapter 13? What's my recourse? If he files for Chapter 7, what's my recourse? THANKS in advance.",

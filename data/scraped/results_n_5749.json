        "Criminal charges do not \"go away\" because of bankruptcy. A civil lawsuit for money damages stemming from a civil assault may or may not be bankruptable. You need a competent lawyer to advise you.",
        "Yeah, relying on an ex-convict for legal advice isn't such a good idea. Not only does bankruptcy not affect the right of the government to pursue criminal charges, but debt related to criminal matters are subject to being found ineligible for discharge in bankruptcy. Hope this perspective helps!",
        "Criminal charges have absolutely nothing to do with bankruptcy. A bankruptcy could potentially discharge outstanding debts but would have absolutely no impact on a criminal charge or case.\n\nIf you're asking whether an individual would pursue a civil case against you for the tort of assault if you went bankrupt, then I suppose it would be up to the individual to decide if they wanted to sue you or not. I don't believe a judgment from a civil lawsuit would discharge in the bankruptcy, but you could verify with a bankruptcy attorney.\n\nNow that you're contemplating an intentional act in retaliation for your perceived financial harm, you've opened the door to punitive damages as well as aggravating circumstances in any criminal case.\n\nThe best advice? Handle this legally through the court system. An assault out of revenge can only blow up in your face.",
        "No."

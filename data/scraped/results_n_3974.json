    "title": "Superior Courts calling on behalf of collectors?",
    "question": "I recently rcvd a call from someone at the local Superior Court re: a debt I owe (but not owed to the Court). The person said she needed to schedule me to appear in front of a judge. Bewildered & confused, I was given a \"case no.\" and directed to call the firm of Goldman, Kessler & Brown (a toll free number) to resolve the matter. When I called them they, attempted to get me to pay a delinquent payday loan, by credit card or electronic check or I would be sued. I disputed the debt and hung up on them. I am taking further actions against them but would like to know 1.) The caller ID was a valid number from Sup. Ct...Are courts in the business of cooperating w/collectors like this? 2) Who can I contact at the court? BTW...I have not been served w/a complaint nor was a complaint filed.",

        "They rigged their phone to show the courthouse phone number. If you can identify who really called you, you can sue for violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. Also, the \"law firm\" is probably not a real law firm. did they give you the name of an attorney, and does that attorney have a State Bar number?\n\nUnless you have filed papers in a lawsuit, and you have paid the court filing fee, the court is not going to call you for any reason other than jury duty.",
        "This sounds like a scam to me. The Superior Court is not going to make calls on behalf of a creditor and ask you to get in touch with the creditor to resolve the matter. If there is not an active case against you, the courts would not be contacting your for any reason.",
        "Court employees in this state do not place calls to any person unless there is a ACTIVE court case and the clerk (or court attorney) must communicate with one of the parties about something. Certainly, if no case is has been filed in that court, the call would not have originated from there. Unpaid consumer debts are not a concern of the Superior Courts, unless they are being litigated. So it's safe to assume that the first call was from a debt collector who was pretending to be a court clerk.\n\nMy suggestion would be to keep detailed records on all contacts with this debt collector, including numbers that show on your caller ID, dates and times of phone calls, and what specifically is said to you. Get names and addresses of anyone you speak to (whether the call is to you or from you). If any communication is misleading, fraudulent or harassing, the debt collector will be in violation of both state and federal fair debt collection statutes. Impersonation of court personnel would certainly be misleading and fraudulent. You may be entitled to damages from this debt collector.\n\nI would also encourage you to discuss this situation with a a consumer attorney or debt defense attorney.",
        "This smacks of a scam, using a spoofed phone number to make the call appear legitimate.\n\nIf you want to be sure, get the civil clerk's number off the court website and call.",
        "I would bet my oldest child that this is a scam, and that the \"law firm\" is going to ask you to pay with a cash card or western union. Call the police or the FBI."

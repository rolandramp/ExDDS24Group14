    "question": "I am the sole Trustee and Executor of my mother's estate (d. Jan 2015). My father predeceased her. Most of her assets (house, cars, jewelry, art, etc) were in a Trust except for one IRA account that must go through probate because she neglected to list a beneficiary other than my father. There are some outstanding tax and other debts that need to be paid. I am planning to keep her house, refinance it and pull some money out to make some repairs and then use it as a rental. I was told I need two taxpayer IDs, one for the trust assets and one for the probate assets. I was planning to use the assets from the probate accounts to pay off the remaining debts from the estate.",

Tax debt can be paid from the trust account on the real property. If income taxes are due on the probated estate, that would come from the IRA account. Are you sure that the IRA account can't be put into the trust via what is called a Hegsted petition?",

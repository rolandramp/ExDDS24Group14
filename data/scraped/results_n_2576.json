    "title": "Financed car damaged after bankruptcy. Reaffirmation agreement was not approved by judge. Am I responsible for fixing car?",
    "question": "I was financing a 15 year old car. I reaffirmed in my petition, but had the judge not approve the reaffirmation. I was in an accident that was my fault and the car suffered 2k in damage. It does not currently run. If I surrender the car, I know the finance company cannot seek contract damages, but can it seek reimbursement for the damage to the car? (The cost of repair does NOT exceed the value of the car.) Thanks.",

        "Since you say nothing about insurance coverage, I will assume there is none. Since the accident was post-petition, I believe you will be responsible for the damages. The lack of a reaffirmation is not relevant. What does your lawyer say?",
        "Since the debt wasn't reaffirmed, the car lender could have taken the car back or let you make payments knowing that they couldn't look to you persona;;y for the the balance owed on the car if re-possessed. I am of the opinion that they take the car back as is. I wold be interested in what my colleagues think.",
        "Technically I think they could since you damaged their property post petition. In practice, I don't think a lender would unless the amount was a lot more. That said, you would also have to be negligent and they would have to prove that. Since you said the accident was NOT your fault, I doubt you have anything to worry about.\n\nRob"

        "From your question it sounds like the item belonged to your father before his death, then was passed to his son/your brother after his death, and then was passed to your brother's daughter/your niece. Property passes on death. I see no grounds for a lawsuit. If you are implying your brother wrongfully obtained the item from your father or his estate -- you would have a hard time explaining the 13-year delay in bringing the action.",
        "You have wasted 13 years. Probably too late to recover the \"item\"."

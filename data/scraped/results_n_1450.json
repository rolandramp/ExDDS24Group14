        "The short answer is YES, debt incurred in relation to bankruptcy can be discharged through bankruptcy. I agree that sometimes issues can arise where cash advances and personal loans were taken out shortly before filing the bankruptcy. The passage of time can help remove the appearance of any fraud, where no actual fraud exists and seeking professional help, e.g., Gamblers Anonymous could help too.\n\nContact a Bankruptcy Attorney in your District (So. Dist of California) to help you navigate through these issues.",
        "You can only file chapter 7 bankruptcy once every eight years. Without treating the underlying cause of your debt problem you will be back in the soup with no way to get out. Please seek treatment for your addiction as part of your strategy to get a fresh start. I have clients who have lost more than just the money.. spouse, children, job. Don't be one of them.",
        "Yes, they can be discharged but sometimes problems can arise. It's important how these issues are addressed in your chapter 7, as my colleague pointed out. I would not file without a good local bankruptcy attorney. We all have free consultations so get a couple of opinions.",
        "From 1992 until shortly after Katrina hit the Mississippi Gulf Coast in 2005, I drove by 7 casinos to get to work every day. I represented a lot of folks that lost their money gambling. The most common problem with discharge of the debt used for gambling occurred when my clients ran up their credit cards in the past year or less. In the Fifth Circuit, a case called In re Mercer held that if someone charged funds on his/her credit cards to us the money gambling, then he/she had to prove that he/she had reasonable grounds to believe that he/she would be able to repay the money when the advances were made.\n\nMy understanding is that in the Ninth Circuit, which includes California, it is more difficult for the lenders to prove interchangeability of debt incurred that was used for gambling. However, the best way to find out the answer to your question is to take the time to meet with an experienced bankruptcy attorney that handles chapter 7 and chapter 13 cases and has a good understanding of discharge litigation.

The second, third and other times I heard it, I realized that gambling can be extremely addictive behavior.",
        "Possible to discharge, however; cash advances and gambling debt in particular should be addressed in a particular way in your bankruptcy case. If you have made no attempt to repay the loans/cash advances thus far, you may also be well advised to enter a recovery program such as Gamblers Anonymous pre-bankruptcy filing.\n\nBottom line: be sure to seek professional legal representstion to assist with your bankruptcy case.",
        "Loan proceeds use to gamble are dischargeable absent some kind of fraud by the borrower which induces the lender to grant a loan relying on fraudulent information."

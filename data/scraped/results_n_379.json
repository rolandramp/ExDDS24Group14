    "answers": [
        "As all the previous attorneys stated, domestic and child support obligations are no dischargeable. Property division and equitable distributions are not dischargeable in Chapter 7, but may be dischargeable in Chapter 13.",
        "Domestic support obligations are not dischargeable but property division/equitable distribution settlements can be discharged in a chapter 13 (but not in a chapter 7). If your ex files a bankruptcy you'll need to consult with a local bankruptcy attorney to see what you can do.",
        "It depends on whether or not the \"settlement\" is for domestic support or a property division. No for the former and maybe for the latter. Find/consult/hire a lawyer using the Avvo feature \"Find a Lawyer\". Make a list of 4-5 having many 5 star reviews from satisfied clients. If you don't get a prompt call back from one, go on to the next on your list. Some offer a free consultation by phone or in person.",
        "If the \"settlement\" to which you refer is not support, but rather something else, such as marital equalization, those types of debts are dischargeable so could be paid less than 100% in a Chapter 13 case (depending on factors such as the value of debtor's assets and their budget)."

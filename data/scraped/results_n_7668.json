    "title": "I am getting a judgement filed on my 2nd mortgage does that mean I will never have credit again.",
    "question": "I want to file ch. 7 to get rid of my credit card debt, but will have a judgement on my 2nd mortgage. Does this mean I still will have no credit with this hanging on? Can they garnish wages? If I'm not going to reestablish credit after getting rid of credit card debt and still having this judgement on me, then why should I even file chp. 7?",
    "answers": [
        "The judgment will be unenforceable against you since any obligation owed to the judgment creditor will be discharged pursuant to the Chapter 7 filing.",
        "After filing for Chapter 7, it may be easier than you think to secure new credit. This, as you cannot discharge your debts in a subsequent Chapter 7 for eight years, and your creditors are aware of this. Notwithstanding, as with any derogatory mark on your credit report, the cost of money will increase.\n\nIf your principal concern is the second mortgage, it may or may not make sense to consider a Chapter 13, whereby you can lien strip the second if the home is worth less than what is owed on the first mortgage.",
        "If you file a Chapter 7 bankruptcy the judgment or liability on the judgment would be discharged or wiped away. The creditor can sue on the judgment and garnish if you don't file a bankruptcy. When you have a second mortgage coming after you for money then it generally makes sense to file a bankruptcy. Speak with a bankruptcy attorney in your area and make sure the mortgage company and attorney who filed the suit are listed. Hope this helps.",
        "The filing of your Chapter 7 bankruptcy will eliminate your liability on the judgment and halt any garnishment, lien or levies. Your ability to reestablished your credit after a bankruptcy will be unchanged by the fact the judgment was entered prior to filing bankruptcy. Just make sure your attorney lists both the orginal creditor and the attorney for the creditor."

    "title": "What is the statute of limitations on an (open book) account on a personal collection account on my credit report?",
    "question": "I am being sued by a collection agency for a personal credit collection account that went in default on March 12,2005. Is the statute of limitations for \"open book contract\" been reached? I think for California it is 4 years? I have to appear in court next month. Can they still legally collect on this? I talked to the original creditor and they stated the account closed on March 12, 2005 and this is the second collection agency that purchased the account. The account was purchased in 2007. I was served court papers on October 7, 2008 for what is called a rule 3.740 Collections.",

Tsegeletos, 231 Cal.App.3d 967, 972-73, 283 Cal.Rptr. 48 (1991), on an account stated complaint, the four-year statute of limitations period begins when credit is no longer extended on the account. You would review your old account statements to find this date. The lawsuit must be filed with the clerk of the court within four years of that date. If you prove that the case as filed after statute of limitations period, you may also be able to get the debt collector to pay your actual damages, costs, and attorney's fees.\n\nAlso, there are many things that a debt collector must prove in court to win, even if they filed the lawsuit within the statute of limitations.

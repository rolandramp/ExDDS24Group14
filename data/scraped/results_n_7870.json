        "Actually, if the student loans were federally generated or federally insured then social security benefits may be garnished to collect the loan debt. SSA is limited to taking 15% of the monthly SS retirement benefits. See:\n\nhttp://seniorjournal.com/NEWS/SocialSecurity/5-12-08-SS-StudentLoans.htm",
        "You need to start considering how to protect yourself too.",
        "Social Security is protected and so are the proceeds. Pensions are protected, but not the proceeds. Once the money hits the bank account, it can be garnished unless state law protects it. However, if your parents are in Mexico, I doubt the loan company will be able to reach their property down there."

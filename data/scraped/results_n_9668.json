        "The Means Test works like this:\n\nMeans test step 1: Your income is compared to the median income for a similarlyâ€‘sized family in California.\n\nIf your income is less than the median income then you are not considered ineligible to file a Chapter 7 bankruptcy â€‘ no Step 2.\n\nMeans test step 2: But if your income is more than the median income then you have to go to Step 2. In Step 2 you subtract expenses from your income to see if you have anything left. If you have any more than a few dollars left over you are presumed to be ineligible to file a Chapter 7 bankruptcy. This is called a \"presumption of abuse.\"\n\nYou might be thinking \"That's no problem. I can show plenty of expenses.\" But for certain expenses (such as housing and transportation) you aren't allowed to deduct your actual expenses. For these expenses you are only allowed to deduct the allowed expenses. These are the government thinks you should have rather than the expenses you actually have.\n\nYou might be thinking that your monthly mortgage payments are higher than the amount allowed as a deduction and wondering what you can do about that.\n\nAt the time I write this, according to the IRS Local Standards, a family of 4 in San Diego County receives a deduction for mortgage payments of $1,908.00. (Its a little different in Riverside County) But what if your mortgage payments are $3,500 per month and you plan on staying in the house after declaring bankruptcy? If you only are getting a deduction of $1,908.00 but your monthly mortgage payments are $3,500 your disposable income would seem to be overstated by $1,592.00.\n\nFortunately there is a solution. In addition to the deduction for housing you are also allowed a deduction for future payments on secured debt. The debtor may deduct from current monthly income the total of all amounts contractually due to all secured creditors in the 60 months following filing of the bankruptcy case, divided by 60.\n\nThis means you can deduct from your monthly disposable income the total of all the mortgage payments that will be due in the next 5 years divided by 60.\n\nYou might be wondering:\n\n\"I understand that I can deduct the payments on my home mortgage that will be due in the next 60 months. What about my car payments? What about payments that will be due on a rental property I own\"?\n\nAs stated above, you may deduct from your current monthly income the total of all amounts contractually due to all secured creditors in the 60 months following filing of the bankruptcy case, divided by 60. It doesn't matter what the property is that is securing the debt. Although there may be a problem if the property is a luxury item.\n\nAlso if you are behind on your mortgage, you can deduct from your current monthly income 1/60th of the past due amount on your home mortgage. But you are not allowed to deduct the past due amount of the rental property you own. The reason is that the property securing the debt (collateral) must be necessary for the support of the debtor or debtor's dependents (e.g., primary residence, motor vehicle).\n\nYou can take the Means Test online for free by going to one of the online Means Test sites. You will find a link on my web site.\n\nYou might be thinking: \"I think I pass the means test but I am not completely sure? What happens what happens if we file for bankruptcy but the court concludes that I flunked the means test?\"\n\nThe answer is that the court may dismiss your case. But You wil be given the option to switch your case to a Chapter 13.",
        "I am not a lawyer in your state but I can offer some general advice.\n\nTo be eligible to file chapter 7 you must either (1) be below the state medium income for your family size (Google US Trustee to get the income chart, or (2) show that you do not have means to repay (by demonstrating that over the next 60 months you have less then $6,500 in disposable income.\n\nMost consumers that file chapter 7 pay nothing to their creditors, not pennies.\n\nYou should talk to a local lawyer about your situation.\n\nGood luck.\n\n\nRobert Kovacs"

        "No one can promise to get accurate derogatory information removed from your credit report. Well, they can promise it but that would violate CROA, and the bureaus are not obligated to remove such items prior to the expiration of the time period set forth in the Fair Credit Reporting Act. But by paying it off it will help your credit score a little, as it will zero out a bad debt.",
        "If it's only $600, you should pay it or settle it so that your credit report no longer shows a balance due.\nThen, you should dispute the past due entry with the credit reporting agency (you can do this online if you prefer ... you don't need a lawyer). If the CRA cannot verify the negative entry within 30 days, they must remove it. If it's already paid, there's a good chance that the creditor will not bother verifying it.",
        "Be very clear on what this lawyer said could be done for you. Accurate information stays on the credit report, and you can dispute the credit report entries without paying someone to do it. You can also negotiate for a payment of less than $600 I would bet. Sometimes you can even negotiate what they report on the credit report. Anything negotiated should be in writing too so you can enforce it later on.",
        "I'm not clear what you mean by \"derogatory remark.\" A credit report from TransUnion, Experian or Equifax will show if your account is current or if delinquent, ho many months past due. It will aso show any judgments which have been obtained against you in court. There is no such thing as \"paying\" someone to have the truthful information in a credit report removed. If you pay the debt, the credit report should be amended to show that the debt was paid but it still will show for up to ten years that it was \"past due.\"",
        "Your credit report is allowed to report true and accurate information about you. No attorney, or service, or physics professor can change the past. Once you pay the debt, the status entry should be updated to show as paid, that will help your credit. But it is a pervasive myth that derogatory items can simply \"be removed\" from someones credit report because the person wants it removed."

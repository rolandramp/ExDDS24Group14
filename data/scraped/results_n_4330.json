    "title": "Can I apply for citizenship with a bankruptcy on my record?",
    "question": "I am currently a permanent resident and plan to file for citizenship in a few months. I have filed for chapter 7 about 8 years ago and recently filed for another chapter 7 for my unsecured debt and chapter 13 for my HOA debts. Will having bankruptcy filings affect my citizenship approval?",
    "answers": [
        "Unlikely, unless it was denied for reasons showing bad moral character.",
        "Absolutely not. We handle both immigration and bankruptcy proceedings, and a bankruptcy does not affect eligibility for citizenship/naturalization.\n\nIn fact, we have served clients with absolutely no legal status in the United States, and have successfully obtained discharge on such clients.",
        "Not without more.",
        "Only if it indicates that you are \"likely to become a public charge\" meaning that you lack medical insurance and have an ongoing medical problem that might require you to receive care at a public hospital or some other type of welfare benefits. Hope this perspective helps!",
        "No, as BK is a civil matter and not criminal.",
        "No."

    "question": "I have a judgment lien against a property. There is $900,000 equity in the property and my lien is for $450,000. Do I have to wait until the property is sold by the debtor or can I foreclose on the property? If yes, how do I go about it? Would it be an action for judicial foreclosure? What are the steps involved? Thank you",

        "Take your certified judgment to the County Sheriff and request that he seize and auction the property to satisfy the judgment. There may be a deposit required.... there is in Riverside County, but just a couple of thousand dollars. Good luck!",
        "I agree with Mr. Starrett. You need not wait. If there is that much equity in the property (so that that there is equity over and above any homestead exemption which may go to satisfy the judgment) you can levy and sell the property. For exact procedure consult Code of Civil Procedure sections 704.710 et seq.",
        "It would be a non-judicial foreclosure.",
        "You can foreclose but you'll need to visit your local law library and research the steps.\n\nOr hire an attorney.",
        "With a writ of execution, you can have the county sheriff levy and sell the property."

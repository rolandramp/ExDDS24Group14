    "title": "Can I skip a mortgage payment?",
    "question": "We are filing for bankruptcy as soon as we can get the money to pay an attorney to do it. The problem is that saving up the money to pay the attorney means we will have to put it off for at least another 3-4 months pending no financial surprises. We are current on our mortgage and intend to keep our house. We were wondering what would happen if we skipped out mortgage payment to pay the attorney and how that would work out in the bankruptcy proceedings? We would only need to skip one payment in order to have enough but are reluctant to do that if that means they could take our house or expect us to come up with the deficit in a lump sum after the bankruptcy.....how does that work? Thanks in advance.",

        "I am a little concerned about how much you are planning on paying an attorney? It is usually not recommended to skip a mortgage payment unless you are going to be doing a chapter 13. If you are filing a chapter 7 then you definitely should not skip a mortgage payment.

        "Never reaffirm a mortgage. I know no attorney who would ever advise it and it is not required. I wonder whether any judge would even agree to it given the lack of equity in the home. If you are filing Chapter 13, the missed payment would just get added to the bankruptcy plan to catch up. If you are filing Chapter 7, you should be current and remain current. If you are not, you may end up with additional costs.\n\nSome attorneys will finance part of the cost in a Chapter 13.

        "Because you intend to keep your home, you can enter into a Reaffirmation Agreement with the mortgage lender.

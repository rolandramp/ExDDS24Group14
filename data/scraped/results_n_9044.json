    "title": "If chapter 7 is dismissed under the totality of circumstances or too much $ [707(b)3 dismissal], when can I refile / what effect",
    "question": "My question is, if I get dismissed because of high income or because the trustee disagrees with my means test deductions, etc., When can I re-file? What effects will the dismissal have? The reason I ask is because a few months from now my 6 month income average will be substantially lower.",

        "Check the original order dismissing the case. I agree that unless that order limits our refiling, you can refile any time. If you qualify to file Chapter 7 again, pay careful attention the reasons for the original dismissal and the differences between that case and the new case. If you are left with no choice, but to file a Chapter 13, the Automatic Stay, which protects you from creditors during the bankruptcy, may be limited to 30 days without a Motion to Extend.\n\nBe careful with subsequent filings.\n\nThis response is meant for information purposes only. The specific circumstances surrounding your case need to be evaluated carefully before relying on this information.",
        "My understanding is that if your case is dismissed under 707(b)(3) you can refile at any time and there should be no penalty (assuming you then otherwise qualify under the means test, etc. at that time). The only way there would be a prohibition on refiling is if the court specifically orders that, in which case you would need to wait 180 days from the dismissal date, but that would be very unusual and there would need to be egregious circumstances for that to happen."

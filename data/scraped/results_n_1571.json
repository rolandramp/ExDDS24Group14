    "title": "How can I get appointed as personal representative for my son's estate in which I plan on using the small estate procedure?",
    "question": "My son passed away and died without a will. I want to be the personal representative and make sure my ex husband is not. His is estate is under $150,000 and I want to make sure a specific debt is paid, a very nice friend of the family load him money to start a business.",
    "answers": [
        "Yes. You may petition court to be appointed personal representative of son's estate. You and biological father have equal priority of appointment. I encourage you to file first. H may file competing petition. Court will decide who to appoint.\nIf you are appointed personal representative, you will have authority to approve or deny creditor's claims. Friend of family should submit creditor's c;aim. You can then approve or deny. If approved, claim will be paid from son's estate.",
        "Based upon the information you have provided, you may well have to file for probate even though the estate is under $150,000. If he had no spouse or children, you and your ex husband are his legal heirs and you want to protect yourself from the ex husband making claims against you for picking and choosing who to pay. I would speak with a probate attorney about your options.",
        "How do you know the value is under $150,000? What is the gross value (not the net) of the business? If indeed the estate is under the gross value of $150,000 then all that is needed is the completion of a small estate affidavit under Probate Code Section 13100 and no personal representative appoint is needed. The affidavit could be submitted to the court for approval under an appropriate petition if you need court orders. But if the estate is over the amount, then just file a petition to probate his estate and ask the court to appoint you as executor.",
        "Using the small estate procedure requires that all beneficiaries sign the form. Your ex-husband may be a beneficiary if your son had no issue nor spouse. However you may go ahead a prepare the forms, sign them, have him sign, and present them to the financial institutions holding the assets. Those institutions will pay the assets equally to both beneficiaries. I do not see how you can have the debt paid from your husband's share without filing for an actual probate.",
        "If there are no adult children you can obtain the funds with a Probate Code 13100 affidavit. If the funds are in the bank the bank may be able to help with that.\n\nAny debts of your son must be paid before any distributions are made.\n\nThere may be other debts or tax obligations you are unaware of.\n\nTo determine the legal way to make the distributions I suggest you contact a probate attorney.\n\nIf you accept the funds and err in the distributions, you could be liable for any losses by any heir at law. Further, the estate funds will be used to pay the attorney but keep very good records!"

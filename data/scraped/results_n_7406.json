    "question": "I was married in California to my U.S. citizen wife in 2004. I got deported from the U.S. in 2006 and had no contact with my wife. In 2010 I married a woman in Argentina. Now I have finally been able to contact my wife and speak with her. I am planning on filing a divorce from her in California. My questions are: 1) What happens to my marriage in Argentina? 2) Does me getting married in Argentina affect my divorce in California as far as assets and child custody? There are assets in my marriage and I want to know if I loose them because I got married in Argentina. Thank you for any help!!",

        "Under California law, your most recent marriage is not valid. The state will not recognize it. This can cause some serious problems, such as if you have health insurance for your \"spouse\" (recent case I consulted on). You really need to get this all resolved.

        "I'm not an expert in Argentine matrimonial law (I don't know if there's one on Avvo) but, at least under the law of the 50 states, your second marriage isn't a valid marriage; you were still married to wife #1, who was and is still alive. Deportation isn't a divorce. Your \"marriage\" in Argentina has no effect on your marriage or divorce in California; however, your second wife may have all sorts of legal rights against you in Argentina, if you told her you were legally able to marry her."

    "question": "hello, I am not a legal resident but do have my own SS/ITIN number. I've recently lost my home about 2 years ago, and my small business 3 months ago. A debt collector left a lawsuit at my brother's home. I do not live there and have never lived in the past 15 years. My brother is the person who is petitioning my residency so maybe that is how the debt collectors hot that address. Can this lawsuit be thrown out for improper service? I want to settle my debt and have no legal problems. I've spoken to the collectors and they are willing to reduce the debt by 50%, which is great. But the reality is I don't have the money. I'd rather declare bankruptcy since I have nothing. No home, no business, not even a job. I'm staying in a garage at a friend's house. How can I settle w collecto",

        "It all comes down to what your ultimate goal is. If you have nothing to offer, then it is unlikely the debt collector will settle with you. Moreover, it is probably not necessary to file for bankruptcy. It is far better to have an unsatisfied default judgment on your credit record than a bankruptcy.",
        "When a creditor arranges to deliver a lawsuit at a particular address, it is usually because their records say that you lived at this address. Did you use your brother's address when you applied for credit? You could review the court records to see how the creditor decided that you could be served at your brother's home, but I wouldn't expect the court to throw out the lawsuit simply because you weren't living where you told the creditor you lived.\n\nBankruptcy could be an option if you own a massive amount of debt, but if you have no job, the creditors can't do anything to you for now! So why worry about it? Bankruptcy is always going to be available down the road.\n\nBTW, I have posted a couple of legal guides on when to file bankruptcy called \"Now or Later\" that might interest you. just click my photo to go to these guides.\n\nHope this perspective helps!",
        "If you do not reside with your brother in his home that is not proper service and a motion to quash could be successful. However, a motion to quash will only prolong the inevitable, which is getting you served so the lawsuit can be litigated. Depending on when it was served, you need to check to see if a default judgment has been entered against you. If you have a lot of debt bankruptcy may be the best option for you.\n\nJames V.

    "question": "I received a restitution payment letter of $35 from aTarget from their attorney but I already paid in May of 2014 and I received the letter in January 2015. I'm just asking if I should pay it again or ask them why I got it again? I also received a civil demand letter of $150. I heard its best to ignore the $150.",

        "You can respond to the restitution payment letter with a written statement that you will not pay and request that you not receive any further contact from them. State that you previously paid the restitution and attach a copy of the receipt or payment confirmation (if you received one). You may want to send this statement via certified mail with return receipt requested so you have proof of delivery for future reference in case they resume contacting you.\n\nWas the civil demand letter from an attorney or a collection agency? You can respond to the civil demand letter with a request for verification of the debt to determine more information regarding the collector.",
        "I would simply dispute the debt and advise the lawyer and whoever else to cease all future contact.\n\nThere are some bottom feeders that get a list of suspected shoplifters, etc. and then send out demand letters. They keep a portion of what is collected and are supposed to pay the shop owner (Target/Walmart, etc.) the rest.\n\nIn some cases the attorney was not even retained, and instead the shop owner has already collected actual restitution, or simply received a sum in settlement without any admission of guilt.\n\nIf they persist, you may have a Rosenthal Act violation, and, possibly, a Fair Debt Collection Practices Act violation as well.\n\nIf in doubt, click on \"Find a Lawyer\" above and locate a debt collection defense attorney familiar with shoplifting cases."

        "Generally, secured debt accrues interest at the agreed rate and unsecured debt does not accrue interest. Sometimes the issue is whether the debt is actually secured by the collateral, especially when house values drop. In our jurisdiction, interest does not accrue on mortgages payments in arrears, sometimes a huge benefit. Tell a good Board Certified bankruptcy attorney the whole story and get the whole answer for your situation.",
        "You can definitely file Chapter 13 to pay off the Judgment. Whether it will accrue interest during a Chapter 13 depends on whether it is unsecured or secured. Also, whether you have to pay the entire judgment or just a portion of it depends on your income, monthly expenses, and assets you own. Definitely call an experienced Chapter 13 attorney to discuss your situation and they will be able to analyze your finances and how a Chapter 13 plan can work best for you.",
        "I agree with the previous answers. The question whether you will need to pay the judgment or portion thereof is depended on many factors, such as your income, your assets, your other debts, the status of the judgment as secured or unsecured, etc. I strongly suggest that you consult with a bankruptcy attorney in your area. The attorney will provide you with specific analyses based on the specific facts of your case. Most attorneys provide some type of a free initial consultation",
        "You need to get an attorney to walk you through the process in you jurisdiction. The plan controls. In general unsecured debt get no interest.\n\nGood luck.",
        "The specific terms of your Chapter 13 Plan will depend on an analysis of your budget. Most of the time, no interest is paid to unsecured creditors, but if the judgment creditor obtained and recorded an Abstract of Judgment, that creditor might be able to transform the debt from unsecured to secured and possibly be entitled to interest.

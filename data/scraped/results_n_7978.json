    "question": "I am the executor and my dad's will and the successor trustee of his living trust. Once his house sells, there should be enough money to pay all of his creditors. How do I word the certified letter to his creditors that I know of? How do I word the published Notice to Creditors that I don't know of. This matter will not be probated. Also, what is the timeframe in which the creditors have to file a claim from my letter, and from the published notice? As successor trustee, should I request that the claims be sent to me? Thank you.",

        "Mr. Weinstein has given brilliant advice as usual. You need to understand that sometimes there are good reasons for filing a probate action and managing creditors is one of them. You may want to limit them to the claims period in a probate action and have finality. You are about to embark on a huge amount of work. It would serve you well to at least talk to a probate attorney.\n\nUse the AVVO.com web site to find an attorney in your area. In addition to that, contact your local bar association for referral to an attorney who specializes in this. Often, but not always, the attorney will do an initial consultation free of charge. You will then be in a better position to determine what to do next. Best of luck to you!",
        "As the executor of your dad's will and successor trustee of his trust you are going to be very busy and may want to consult an attorney regarding what steps to take and when to take them. I will attempt to give you a brief preliminary list of the items you should consider:\n1. Because you state that there will be no probate I assume that you have investigated and determined that your father has less than $100,000 of assets not in the name of the trust or not held in joint title or not having a named beneficiary? You need to double check that this is true or probate is in your future.\n2. As the successor trustee you need to provide all beneficiaries and potential beneficiaries a notice of death of trustee, that the trust has become irrevocable, who the new trustee is, etc, and that they have 180 days to challenge the trust. The requirements for the notice is set out in the Probate Code.\n3. You need to record a Notice of Death of Trustor/Trustee. A notice to the assessor is also a good idea so tax bills get delivered.\n4. As successor trustee you are not required to give notice to your father's creditors. However, his creditors can open probate to come after his assets, if not paid - this may include assets of the trust. As a method to assure that a creditor does not later \"come out of the woodwork\", you should write a short letter to the known creditors as the son of the deceased informing them to submit a claim to you. Additionally, although not required you should publish a notice of death. Each court has a list of approved publications and you should contact one to place a notice. They do this all the time and will provide the format with your assistance. Last, read dad's trust to see whether he instructs the trust to pay his debts.\n5. Since you are not going to open probate, there are varying time frames for creditor's claims and when they can file a complaint for collection. It will depend on various factors such as time of notice, whether the contract was written or oral and other factors.\n\nAs I hope you can see, you have embarked on what could be a complex task depending on the nature of your father's estate and trust. You should at least have a one or two hour consultation with an attorney to discuss your father's estate and trust and the nature of his debt. This will give you a better idea of whether you feel capable of handling the estate and trust or you should be retaining counsel to assist you."

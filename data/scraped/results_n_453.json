    "title": "I represent myself in a chapter 7 bankruptcy. I want to speak with the judge to explain what us trustee is doing. How can I?",
    "question": "I had a lawyer but eventually couldn't afford to pay anything more. The us trustee just keeps peppering me with requests and never wants to speak with me. Is there something I could file to allow me to go before the court and speak directly to the judge / let the judge know that it is unfair how long this is dragging out and how they keep getting the deadlines extended? Please help point me in the right direction.",

        "Attorney Rode is correct. It is almost impossible to give you useful advice without knowing the details involved in your case. If the US trustee is involved, something serious needs to be addressed. The US Trustee gets involved when there are tax issues, fraud, and such. You may be referring to the appointed trustee who is tasked with the administration of your case. If you have assets with excess equity, that asset may be liquidated by the trustee and the money used to pay the trustee's costs/expenses, then money can be distributed to your creditors. If you have lost faith in your lawyer or cannot afford to continue, you may want to consider hiring a lawyer on an \"as needed basis\".\n\nFind/consult/hire a new lawyer using the Avvo feature \"Find a Lawyer\".

        "This is hard to provide advice without knowing the facts pertaining to your case and the US Trustee's requests. The US Trustee may make requests and you do need to cooperate and comply with their requests. If anything is going to happen on your, such as the trustee moves to sell an asset of yours, or they want to object to your discharge, a motion is filed with the Court and you have the opportunity to file an opposition (in writing) explaining to the judge the reasons for your opposition. There is then a hearing you can appear at and make any oral arguments directly to the judge. Hope this helps. When there are issues in a chapter 7 case it can be a very long, drawn out, and tedious process."

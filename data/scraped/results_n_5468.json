        "Credit Unions are membership organizations - or a \"union\" of interest. Almost all credit unions have a policy that if they experience any loss as a result of your bankruptcy, you may no longer be a member of that credit union and therefore may not have a share ( savings ) or a draft\n(checking) account. If you reaffirm your debt, they will allow you to continue your membership in good standing including use of all deposit accounts. If you reaffirm and pay back the credit union, you may find they are still a good source of credit for you in the future.",

        "Hello,\n\nI think the answer to your question depends on the credit union, and their specific rules. Unfortunately, it's be my experience that many credit unions tend to require you to reaffirm (ie. keep/repay) debts you owe them in order to continue to keep your accounts open/in good standing. A point to remember is credit unions are \"membership\" organizations, and not banks. As such... credit unions tend to have different and often more strict rules/restrictions. Ultimately, when you file your chapter 7, if you owe the credit union (due to unpaid overdraft fees), they will need to be included as a creditor. However, one way or another hopefully you will be able to work with them so that you can keep your accounts. I hope this info helps.

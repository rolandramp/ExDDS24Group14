        "Purschasing a car pre petition may help you qualify for a chapter 7 by passing the Means Test. The proper way to do this is to sit down with an experienced bankruptcy attorney who has handled cases like your before. The Means Test can be complex, but a good bankruptcy attorney can tell you whether your purchasing of a vehicle would qualify you for chapter 7.\n\nI strongly suggest you schedule a consultation with a bankruptcy attorney. Many great ones are right here on AVVO.",
        "I'm not sure what you mean by \"more detailed version.\" The means test for chapter 7 is basically 2 parts: a calculation of your income to determine if you qualify to file a chapter 7 based on income alone. If not, then you get to part 2 where you start deducting necessary expenses to determine what would be left over for creditors if you filed a chapter 13. If the amount per month is greater than around $125 a month, the presumption that the chapter 7 is filed in bad faith arises, and you have to provide reasons for why you should still be able to file chapter 7. Talk to an experienced bankruptcy attorney to go over the means test and determine how the final numbers are arrived at to see if you can file a chapter 7.\nOne of the deductions allowed in the means test is for the secured payment on your vehicle and for ownership costs.",

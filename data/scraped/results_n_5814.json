    "title": "How do I amend my Chapter 7 Bankruptcy in CA to add a creditor?",
    "question": "I had a Paralegal take care of the original paperwork. However, I cannot afford to have him do this as well.",
    "answers": [
        "While it is true that the debt to this creditor will be discharged, whether you add them or not; unlisted creditors (even though they are violating the automatic stay and even the discharge injunction) can cause a lot of grief that can be avoided with a simple amendment to add them.\n\nUse local Form B1008 (the cover sheet) and a blank page from your Schedule F. I wouldn't bother with the Summary or the Matrix; but the Central District may be stricter about that than the Southern District.",
        "You might not need to add them at all. If yours is a \"no asset\" case, and the creditor you are referring to is an unsecured creditor, then they will already be covered by the discharge, if you get one. Send them a copy of your \"Notice of Bankruptcy Case Filing\" and they should stop contacting you. If they don't then they are in violation of the automatic stay. If you do want to add them, the courr website has downloadable forms you can fill out online. As the prior response stated, you would want to amend Schedule D (if they are a secured creditor) or Schedule F (if unsecured), along with the Summary of Schedules and the Creditor Mailing Matrix. Also, the cover sheet to use (to attach the amended schedules to) is online also and simply titled \"Amended Schedules\". Also, to add any new creditor requires a $30 filing fee, but you can add as many as you need to for that one filing fee if they are added at the same time.",
        "Doing this is simple, but let me start by saying that bankruptcy is NOT about choosing which creditors to add and which to omit. You are swearing, under penalty of perjury, that you have included ALL your assets (the things you own) and ALL of your liabilities (what you owe) without any exception. And that includes family members or others that you intend to pay once the case is over. Paying creditors after your case is over is your business, but including them all in your case is an absolute requirement so when you add the creditor, make sure you add anyone else you omitted as well.\n\nAs for adding a creditor, it's simple but might be worth going to the paralegal again anyway as there are several steps: first, you have to amend schedules D, E and/or F depending upon what type of creditor this is. Also it is appropriate to amend your Summary of Schedules as well. Next, look at the court's local forms to see if there is a cover sheet required to be included with amendments. If there is, fill that out appropriately. Then finally, you have to upload and amended BANCAP matrix as well as a creditors' matrix. The first is digital, the second is paper.\n\nAfter reading this I think you'll see why having someone with experience doing this is worth a few bucks to make sure everything is done right. It won't cost much (note that there is a small filing fee to do the amendment as well), but it will be money well spent.\n\nGood luck!",
        "Amend Schedule F provide the creditor a copy of the Notice of filing and amend your creditor mailing matrix to include the creditor. At your 341 when the trustee asks are there any errors or ommissions mention that you forgot to include this creditor and make sure you tell the trustee on the record about the harrassment.",
        "Just use schedule F and add them. You will also need to amend the creditor matrix.

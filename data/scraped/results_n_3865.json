        "They can demand payment indefinitely. But legally, the statute of limitations is likely 4 years from breach--i.e., 4 years from when payment became due. You should seek the assistance of an attorney. Probably could be resolved/settled for substantially less than amount billed to you. And your attorney could likely negotiate that any negative information reported to your credit report be deleted as part of settlement. No need to ruin your credit in the process. I'm sure an attorney could handle this for a modest fee.",
        "The deadline for suing for breach of a written contract is 4 years and for an oral (unlikely) contract is 2 years. Why didn't you sue for all medical bills? Why didn't you sue for your noneconomic losses, e.g., pain and suffering? If you acknowledge the debts after the limitations period(s) run(s), you will revive the limitations period(s).",
        "You can submit the medical bills to your health insurance carrier. However, the medical bills probably needed to be submitted to health insurance within 1 year of the date of the treatments. In addition, if your health insurance carrier and/or auto medpay carrier pays for medical bills, the insurance payments are subject to reimbursement if there is any recovery from a liable third-party. The medical bills can probably be negotiated to a lower amount. Contact a local lawyer for assistance.",
        "If you signed a treatment agreement the medical provider can sue for breach of written contract, a four year statute in California.",
        "It depends. If you signed an agreement to pay when you went to ER or doctor, or ambulance etc. then they have 4 yrs to sue. If they provided treatment w/o your signing agreement to pay, they have 2 yrs.\nIf you promised to pay them and made any payments, that could change the situation. You may need to get all papers and details and consult with collection defense atty.",
        "Contract claims are four years. You might want to try to settle these; they'll probably take less than the full amount.",
        "4 yrs, but best bet is to submit bills to Blue Cross to resolve.",
        "Submit the bills to Blue Cross, and talk with the providers, they may forgive the excess owed and cooperate with you.",
        "Breach of written contract 4 years from time of breach. Breach of an oral contract 2 years from time of breach. There are also statutes specifically covering medical bills depending on how they were incurred. Not sure what category your matter falls into.\n\nAt the very least I would suggest you may want have the bills submitted your Blue Cross for consideration.\n\nYou should discuss this with your lawyer, not put up a post like this."

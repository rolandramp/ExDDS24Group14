        "I agree you need an attorney. One thing that my colleagues did not mention is that in most, if not all states, judges and other court officials have qualified immunity for their judicial actions.",
        "I would love to talk to you just to figure out what in the world you are trying to accomplish. Not sure who has filed bankruptcy here, who the creditor is, and what debt is allegedly owed.",
        "You are confusing giving notice to the court with suing the court. Your question is similar to one you posted recently. Trying to navigate your bankruptcy matter by relying on free advice of a general nature is not a substitute to your consulting with an experienced BK lawyer.",
        "It does seem to be a little \"out there\" to name a Superior Court as a defendant in a lawsuit, and maybe even more so in a Bankruptcy adversary proceeding. I say this because the federal court system generally cannot take action against a state court (state court decision or judgment). There are few exceptions and federal judges, including bankruptcy judges, like to avoid finding that the exceptions apply.\n\nThat doesn't your question, but it might give you some perspective on whether you are expending energy in a way that makes sense.",
        "you brought an law suit against a Court???? Probably the State Attorney General",
        "I have no idea what you are trying to do, but I do know that if you expect to get anywhere with this you need counsel experienced in bankruptcy litigation."

    "title": "I recently took out a loan, but I am now considering bankruptcy (No asset, Chapter 7). How will this affect my proceedings?",
    "question": "I didn't plan on filing for bankruptcy when I accepted the loan. About a month and a half ago, a company I already have a loan with offered to loan me more money. I took the extra money hoping to consolidate my debt and lessen my monthly burden. The extra money ended up going to pay other creditors, but my financial situation hasn't improved at all. I never knew bankruptcy was an option for me, but after reading the book \"Bankruptcy for Dummies\", I'm strongly considering it.",

        "You will be in a world of hurt if you decide to file bankruptcy within 90 days of taking out the loan.

The rules and procedures (both local bankruptcy rules and federal rules of civil procedure) involved are beyond the comprehension of a layperson. Plus, the cost of retaining a bankruptcy attorney to handle an AP is extremely expensive.

        "“If you are able to prove that you thought you would be able to pay back the loan when you borrowed the money, you will be able to discharge that debt in bankruptcy. As a general rule, you should wait to file bankruptcy until 90 days has elapsed since you took out the loan. The reason to wait 90 days is because the burden of proof will shift in your favor after 90 days. The burden of proof designates whether the plaintiff or defendant has the burden of proving its case (in your case fraud). For example, if your case goes to trial and the evidence is so even on each side that the judge is unable to determine whether you intended to pay back the loan, then you will win if the loan was taken out more than 90 days before you filed bankruptcy and the creditor will win if you took out the loan within the 90 days before you filed bankruptcy. This is because the creditor has the burden of proof if the loan is older than 90 days and you have the burden of proof if the debt is newer than 90 days. The burden of proving fraud is on the creditor if the debt is older than 90 days, the burden of proving lack of fraud is on you if the debt is newer than 90 days. In short, it is safer to wait until the burden has shifted to the creditor before filing bankruptcy.\n\nEven if the burden shifts, however, the creditor can still win if it is able to convince the judge that when you borrowed the money you never intended to repay. The evidence can consist of proof of your earnings, history of credit card payments, types of charges to your credit cards, etc.\n\nThe worst case scenario is that you would end up having to repay some of the charges on those credit cards.",
        "If the creditor thinks fraud was involved, they could file an adversary proceeding asking the court to order that this debt is nondischargeable (meaning you would have to pay it back after bankruptcy). If you had the intention of paying the debt back when you took it out, you should be able to beat any such claims. Sometimes, in the case of cash advances and purchases of luxury goods, there is a presumption that you had fraudulent intent, which could make it harder. That's the broad idea, but you would be well-served to go sit down with a bankruptcy attorney or two, discuss the details of your situation, and get clear advice based on those details. Most bankruptcy attorneys offer free consultations. Best of luck to you."

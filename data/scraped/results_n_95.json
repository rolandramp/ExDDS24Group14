    "title": "When someone filed for bankruptcy, are they required to give creditors notice?",
    "question": "My relative is filed for discharge bankruptcy and owes me $5,000.. 1) he never told me this nor did I get anything from the court and 2) I know he has hidden assets. I mean personally like putting cars in ex wife name and a rental house because he had irs issues and told me he had to hide stuff. The bankruptcy is still pending.",
    "answers": [
        "Since you were not given notice, you can probably still file an objection to discharge, but the legal fees to do so may be more that what is owed to you. At the very least you should contact the Bankruptcy Trustee assigned tot he case, preferably in letter form, and tell the Trustee what you know.",
        "Hiding assets and lying about transfers during the course of a bankruptcy proceeding is a federal crime. The Order of Discharge could be denied and a tax payer funded vacation could be in the future. All creditors must be listed on the schedules and all assets must be disclosed. Every case is different and every situation may not be as it appears. Maybe your relative never really owned the assets, for example.",
        "Hire an attorney to enter an appearance on your behalf and discuss whether you have a good claim to object to the discharge of debts or the dischargeability of your debt. Then prepare any evidence you have of attempts to conceal or transfer assets and contact the Office of the United States Trustee for your district with that information. Good luck!",
        "1) Yes, a debtor in BK needs to place all creditors on notice. Which begs the question, how do you know the case is still pending? Where is it at? Seems to me, you have notice of the BK now.\n2) Feel free to contact the trustee or/and the US Trustee's office.\n\nThe more details you provide, the better quality of an answer.",
        "I agree with the answers. First do write a letter to the trustee right away assigned the case by the Court and can call the clerk to find out who it is. Explain in detail all you know for each asset etc. in chronological order. The trustee ONLY gets $60 unless it is a rare asset case so the trustee does not care about your own debt.\n\nBut if there are reasons for the US Trustee's office to investigate for false oaths, hidden assets they need proof etc. and thus you can write to them also.\n\nAs one answer states, sometimes things are different that it seems but to know do your self that step of writing the letters.\n\nThen if you think your debt is not dischargeable based on fraud or lying to you on financial matters, contact your own attorney for advice on action needed, whether you can pursue it yourself etc.\nThanks for asking here on AVVO too.",
        "To be honest, it sounds like you already know the answer to the question, given the details you provided. You may wish to consult a creditor rights lawyer for guidance."

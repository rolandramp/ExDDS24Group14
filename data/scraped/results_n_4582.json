    "title": "Should I negotiate direct with CAPITAL ONE (plaintiff), or with their attorneys NELSON & KENNARD, who are also debt collectors?",
    "question": "Though the summons says the plaintiff is CAPITAL ONE, I wonder if N&K has some arrangement where they are the de facto owners of my debt now (having \"bought\" it at a discount), so they would actually negotiate on their own behalf. Could I even get a settlement agreement directly from CAPITAL ONE (and pay THEM), or am I stuck having to settle with N&K and sending payment to them? I've read bad things about them on ripoffreport, yelp, and other places, so I am wary. Haven't contacted either yet. I'd like to get a lawyer. I need to respond to their service of summons in a week, but ideally, I would like to settle beforehand and have them dismiss with prejudice before I even have to file an answer.",

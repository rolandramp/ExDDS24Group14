    "title": "Is my leased automobile considered as my personal property or not?",
    "question": "Recently I helped some one to file bankruptcy chapter 7. The petitioner has a leased Honda automobile that only 32 payments are left to be paid. Petitioner moved the BK court for reaffirmation of the leased vehicle. At the trustee's meeting petitioner was asked to amend the schedules \"B\" and \"D\" and redo the statement of Intent and resubmit it to the office of the US Trustee. That is really fine, but I always thought that the leased vehicle is NOT the petitioner's personal property because Petitioner is neither the equitable nor the legal owener of the vehicle. The title to the vehicle has not been transferred to the petitioner at the time of petitioning for BK. Please let me know that is it OK to ask for enlisting the vehicle on sch. B and D.",

        "The lease is not personal property, but the interest at the end of the lease could be. The lease debt is not secured.

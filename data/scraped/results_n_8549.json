    "title": "Can I short sale my home during chapter 13 bankruptcy?",
    "question": "I just file chapter 13 bankruptcy 4 days ago and still working on more documents that they requested. However, I know that I cannot afford to keep my house because my income is less than half of what it used to be. A realtor told me that I should ask the bank to do short sale but not sure if I can still do it now since I already file for chapter 13. Can ask the bank to do short sale now or I have to cancel the bankruptcy first then file it again once the short sale is done?",

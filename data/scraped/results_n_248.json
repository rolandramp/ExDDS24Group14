    "title": "What does the Hertz bankruptcy mean for my auto loan?",
    "question": "I have a loan through capital one financing and I bought the vehicle through Hertz. Now that they have filed Chapter 11, I received a legal notice of the bankruptcy and explained how it was it possible that a confirmation of a chapter 11 plan may result in a discharge of debt. What does that mean for me? Does my debt still reside with capital one because they had already purchased the vehicle or will capital one be discharged of the debt it owes to Hertz, and then what? Why would I receive a legal notice of the filing ?",
    "answers": [
        "You received a notice because Hertz probably listed anyone who bought a car from them in the event there was a claim related to that car. They may have listed you as a potential claimant, even if no claim exists. The obligation that would be discharged would be any claim you have AGAINST Hertz, not your debt regarding your vehicle.\nHertz's chapter 11 is unlikely to have any effect on the debt you owe on your car.",
        "I agree with the comments from my colleagues and add the following : You got notice of the Hertz because they consider you a possible creditor for the exact reason of your concern: If Hertz does not honor its service/warranty contract with you, you would have a claim against them. Have you tried to have any warranty work done on your car? Who are the parties to your service/warranty contract.\n\nFind/consult/hire a lawyer using the Avvo feature \"Find a Lawyer\".

        "The bankruptcy for Hertz pertains to Hertz's debts to its creditors. Debts owed TO Hertz are Hertz's assets. Your debt or Capital One's debt TO Hertz, does not get affected by a discharge, because they are not Hertz's debts.",
        "Discharge of debt refers to debts owed by Hertz.\nYou are debtor on loan by Capital One, You still owe the money."

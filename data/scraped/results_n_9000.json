    "title": "How to handle a business partner suspected of fraudulent activities?",
    "question": "There are 7 executive team members running our company. 4 have independently recognized that the CEO has been moving in a direction that appears to go against the corps best efforts coupled with recent evidence of fraudulent actions. The CEO has encouraged and directed fees to be wired to his personal bank account. We are not concerned about embezzlement necessarily, our primary concern is he uses the company image to promote his clandestine schemes and has started to receive complaints from slighted customers. Accusations of pocketing the money w/o performance. Currently he feels his actions are under the radar. The question is how do we handle this to protect the company from any liability civilly and criminally?",

        "I agree that now that you suspect or now about this behavior, you have to act immediately to prevent any further harm or any customers, or the entire \"executive team\" could be sued individually for complicity with this conduct. If this is a partnership, all partners would be liable for tghe partnership debts, so act NOW. Even if this business is a corporation or an LLC, there could be claims that the other officers/directors or members were aware of this conduct and did nothing.\n\nDepending on how your business is structured, you may already have a document that provides for how to handle this type of situation. Contact a business litigator immediately to review your company's operational documents and see whether you already have something in place that addresses officer malfeasance on the part of the CEO. You will also want to get the company's CPA involved to audit the company's funds and trace any misdirected money and assess the extent of the damage.\n\nThis is a fact specific and \"hands on\" analysis that you need to hire a lawyer and CPA for, if you don't have them already, and get them working on this NOW before any further malfeasance is allowed to happen.\n\nDisclaimer: Please note that this answer does not constitute legal advice, and should not be relied on, since each state has different laws, each situation is fact specific, and it is impossible to evaluate a legal problem without a comprehensive consultation and review of all the facts and documents at issue. This answer does not create an attorney-client relationship.",
        "First, you will need to hire an attorney to resolve this matter, and you will need to hire one right away. Start acting immediately to put an end to the CEO' s actions. And you should be concerned about his embezzlement of funds, especially if you have investors who are not on the executive team.\nDepending on your actual company structure, your bylaws may have a mechanism for removing the CEO should he become a liability to the corporation, by his actions.\nOne manner of handling this situation would be for the six executive team members to confront the CEO, tell him too stop, make him return any misappropriated funds and make him do the work which money was taken.\nSince you know about what is going on you now have no option but to act. Non-action at this point may be viewed as negligence or complicity in his actions. His bad acts may be attributed to the six executives who do nothing. Don't be surprised if he starts assigning blame to individuals other then himself as soon as he is confronted.\nIf you can stop the CEO and he agrees to make restitution to the company and to customers immediately, you may want to hire a business psychologist to discuss the CEO's actions with him, in an effort to get him to modify his behavior.\nUltimately he will need to be replaced.\nIf he will not stop what he is doing you can either force him out or leave. If you leave, confidentially, but in writing, notify each member of the Team why you are leaving. Then you may want to go to the department of corporations or any department that licenses your business and turn him in."

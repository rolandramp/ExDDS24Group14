        "In order for creditors to take money from a debtor's bank account, it must do all of the following: (1) file a lawsuit against debtor; (2) get judgment against debtor; (3) get a writ of execution to enforce the judgment; (4) serve Notice of Levy on debtor's bank. If none of those things have happened yet, your income is not currently at risk of being taken by creditors.\n\nEven if you are sued, and lose the case, you can claim all of your Social Security income as \"exempt\" (which means that the Social Security funds will not be accessible to the creditor). Pension money that goes into your bank accounts may be subject to a levy, but you can claim an exemption for any money that is needed for support of yourself and your family.\n\nProviding regular financial support to family members who are unable to support themselves is not \"fraudulent transfer\" of assets. Those funds cannot be recovered by creditors. If you continue to be worried about defaulting on credit card debts, contact a bankruptcy attorney or debt collection defense attorney in your area. Most provide free consultations.",

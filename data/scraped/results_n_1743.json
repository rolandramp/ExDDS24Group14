        "Ms Straus is correct that what you need is a Domestic Relations Order not a QDRO for the division of your pension and we almost always have the orders dividing pension interests prepared by local attorneys who specialize in doing them. It is far more cost effective for them to prepare the orders and get them certified by the plan than for us to prepare them. We think it makes better sense to have the client who is receiving the monthly benefit start paying their spouse each month the best approximation we can make of the percentage of the benefits that will be paid after the DRO is put in place. This prevents the nightmare of having to pay the spouse a lump sum for the spouse's share of the benefits received after separation as property and running the risk that a bench officer will make a spousal support order including all of the monthly benefits as income to the client. The reason we wait is that the equal division of the other assets and the debts of the community cannot be divided equally or would require the sale of an asset that one of the parties does not want sold (most often, the home) and the other party agrees. In those situations we have been able to craft an equal division of the community with an unequal division of the community property interest in the pension. I you call local family law attorneys you likely will be able to get the information for several of the attorneys who prepare QDROs and DROs.",
        "In my cases, I always strive to have the QDRO prepared before entry of judgment. It's easier and cleaner. Once judgment is entered and counsel has withdrawn, you will be on your own regarding getting the QDRO process initiated. QDRO attorneys charge what they charge. Everyone is different. Prices range from flat fees of $500 to $1k+ or hourly rates are applied.",
        "You can start the process anytime. An attorney that has experience in this will first \"join\" the pension plan and then initiate the proposed orders. The costs depend on who you hire and their experience. Start calling attorney's to see if they can do it for you and their prices. I am not allowed to solict business on this forum.",
        "CALSTRS is not an ERISA plan, so what you need is DRO.\n\nThese are easier and less costly than a QDRO. Don't wait until the judgment is entered to get one. Prices vary. You can Google it."

    "title": "I was convicted of a felony D.U.I with G.B.I., and am on formal felony probation. I was ordered to pay restitution. One amount",
    "question": "is on my probation report. But now I'm not working and I'm receiving two other amounts from different collection agency's. And have no money to pay. I was the sole registered owner of the vehicle. Can they go after my wife's wages?. I was the sole owner. I live in California. And I do plan to comply with all debts owed when I can get a job since I was at fault. I am having trouble getting a job since I am not allowed to drive and I am in construction. Also what part if any can I file bankruptcy on? if I am unable to pay will this violate my probation requirements? I have still not been assigned a probation officer yet. So I am worried about what to do.",

        "There are many issues here. The first thing I would tell you is that you need to consult with a good lawyer, and you may need one who knows criminal law, and one who knows civil law; they are different and your quesitons deal with both areas.\n\nAs to the criminal aspect of the case which is my forte, the first thing I would want to know is whether or not a specific amount was ordered by the court as restitution in your probation/sentencing hearing for your DUI? Did the court order that you pay at specified monthly amounts? Or did the court \"reserve jurisdiction\" on the issue of restitution. You need to know this before you can determine the next step to take. You may be entitled to a restitution hearing to determine the amount of the restitution to be owed. And although restitution was ordered as a condition of probation, your probation cannot be violated for not paying it if you in fact have an inability to pay it. (That does not mean it goes away, however). One other thing to note is that very often the victim is paid from the Victim's Restitution Fund and it is the government who is seeking reimbursement from you for the money that they paid the victim - it is still considered to be \"resititution.\"\n\nYes, contacting probation and your probation officer and telling him/her will definitely help in the short term. As to your wife's wages, they are not subject to garnishment based on a restitution order in your criminal case - that only applies to you.\n\nHowever, if there is a civil action filed related to the accident that caused the victims injuries, that is separate and apart from your criminal proceedings. You do not have to pay double, however. If the injured party obtains a judgement in that civil case (assuming your insurance company doesn't cover all the damages; by the way, I assume you have insurance and have notified them of the accident; if there are coverage issues, another reason to get a good civil lawyer), they may seek to collect on the judgement in a variety of ways, including garnishment of wages - subject to many exceptions and limitations. This is why you should consult with a civil attorney to assist you with this process that is different than the criminal process.\n\nI hope this doesn't scare you. It is not insurmountable if you get the able advice of a good lawyer or two....",

        "Yes, the bankruptcy stay will prevent you from proceeding with an eviction, at least briefly. You would need to file a motion for relief from stay to continue your eviction. As pointed out by other counsel, the Covid moratorium on eviction may present more difficulties to obtaining an eviction.",
        "I agree completely with Attorney Steingraber. The bankruptcy code provides an expedited process to get relief from automatic stay, but your bigger problem are the anti eviction measures which are in place in response to the covid pandemic. You need to speak with an experienced landlord tenant attorney who is up on the rules.",
        "The tenant can delay the eviction, but as the LL, you should know that there are expedited procedures available to you in getting relief of stay to commence or complete the eviction process. That said, there are some extra hurdles facing you: COVID 19 eviction moratorium. Ask your lawyer to update the ever changing eviction policies in your county."

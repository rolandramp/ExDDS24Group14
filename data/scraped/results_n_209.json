    "question": "I have a Judgment against me in another state which includes an injunction and monetary award. What is the process of the other party obtaining and enforcing a sister state Judgment in California against me where I live. Do I get due process if that proceeding includes a motion hearing as well as is there a requirement to serve that motion on me? Once served can I ask for a briefing schedule on that motion if I wish to file an opposition? Please response if you know the answers to all of the above. Thank you",

        "The process is relatively simple and my colleagues have accurately described it. That said, the only real defense to an application for a sister-state judgment is whether or not the original court had jurisdiction over you in the first place.

        "The creditor must apply to the court in the county where you live. You are supposed to be served in the same way as if it were a new lawsuit.

        "Yes, you do get due process, in my belief you may also need the services of a lawyer. Generally, a sister state money judgment must be registered in California as a California judgment to be enforceable. You as the Judgment debtor are required to be served with the notice of entry of judgment in the same fashion as the service of summons. Enforcement is stayed for 30 days(equitable relief, even past 30 day deadline may be available, also, the 30 day deadline is inapplicable if the motion to vacate is based on defective subject matter or personal-jurisdiction in the underlying case for voidness). You may file a motion to vacate the judgment if grounds exist, you carry the burden by preponderance of the evidence. The foregoing is generally applicable to sister state money judgments.\nTo enforce most sister state non-money judgments an independent civil action is the only authorized procedure.

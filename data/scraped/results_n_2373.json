    "title": "Can a debt collector request the suspension of my driver's license?",
    "question": "I received a call from an unknown number so I did not answer. The messages stated that they were from Wilson Rely & Associates and that they were giving me a courtesy call to informed me that they were about to serve me with court documents pertaining a debt and that the third party had requested my wages be garnished and my license suspended. I'm a stay-home mom and have not worked for 2 years. When I called back, the lady was eager to \"help me settle out of court\" if I would pay an agreed amount. When she provided the name of the payday loan company I told her it didn't sound familiar and she blank out, she had no idea what to do. What bothers me is the fact that they said they will suspend my driver's license. I didn't provide any bank information, how legit is this?",

        "It is not legit at all and is an example of really egregious behavior on the part of a debt collector. These people are not your friends. They will often fish for information and try to identify susceptible people, hoping that such threats will spur one to action. Most of this type of behavior would subject the debt collector to remedies for violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, etc.. But, with these types of collectors, they are so hard to pin down that it usually makes such pursuit fruitless. Since you called them back, you are probably in their call logs as a \"live one\" that will engender even more collection calls. If they do call back, start asking them particular questions on their name, the organization they work for, their call back number, etc. Write everything down and keep a log. DON'T EVER GIVE A STRANGER OVER THE PHONE ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION SUCH AS SOCIAL SECURITY, BANK INFORMATION, YOUR ADDRESS, BIRTHDATE, MOTHER'S MAIDEN NAME, OR ANYTHING ELSE. PERIOD. If they threaten you with a lawsuit, tell them thank you and will be happy to review it upon receipt. It is pretty unlikely that these types of collectors would actually follow through with a lawsuit, but you will have good records of their contacts for your own counter claim against them one day.",

        "I am 110% certain that this is a scam. A payday lender cannot suspend your driver's license. The court can suspend your driver's license if you are convicted of DUI. The court can also suspend your license if you fail to make court-ordered child support, but there would be an administrative hearing and the option to have a payment plan. Your wages cannot be garnished unless the court enters a civil money judgment. That would involve a lawsuit and (unless you fail to respond to the court summons) a trial, which would be set sometime in 2016.\n\nUnfortunately, there are debt collectors out there who get lists of names of people who have taken out payday loans and, without any authorization from the payday lending company, try to collect money from these victims. A threat to sue you is only legal if an attorney, who is licensed to practice law in your state, has individually reviewed the case. If you can identify the caller who is trying to collect, you may be able to sue for a statutory penalty of $1,000 per violation, plus attorney's fees, but you will need to know the legal name of the entity and the street address of this collector. Unless you have a lot of spare time, I would suggest that you just not talk to these people."

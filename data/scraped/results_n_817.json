    "title": "How do bankruptcy attorneys discover all of your debt in order to include them in your filing?",
    "question": "Many people have a general idea of who they owe. But I am sure many people owe some debt which they are not aware of. For example, a year old credit card debt with 2,000 dollars the debtor forgot about. Or medical bills from a personal injury case, from a separate provider. The debtor doesn't know about. ETC. How exactly, does a bankruptcy attorney go about making sure that all of the persons debt is included in the filing. in order to avoid problems with some debt not being discharged?",

    "answers": [
        "Failure to list a debt does not necessarily mean that it is not discharged. If you have already filed a case and omitted a creditor, you should speak to an experienced bankruptcy attorney for advice about this, including an explanation of the case law defining when an omitted creditor is discharged.\n\nIf you are wondering how a prospective attorney will find out about all your debts, I also suggest that you hired someone with experience. They will direct you in finding as many of your creditors as possible to list to best protect your interests. I expect that you know more about your creditors than you might think.",
        "My firm pulls a specially prepare credit report for each client. We then send the client a copy and ask if the client knows of any other possible bills and if so to provide the information. We also ask for debt collection letters so these businesses are on notice when the bankruptcy is filed, to stop collection actions. We remind the clients to think about any medical and personal debts they remember so we don't have to amend the petition after the case is filed, to add creditors that surface. Adding creditors after filing the bankruptcy requires an additional small filing fee.\nIf you receive a chapter 7 discharge for a no asset chapter 7 then even unlisted pre petition dischargeable debts are discharged because there is no asset to seize and sell and provide a distribution to creditors. Since there is no distribution there is no harm to the creditor who did not receive notice.\nIf you have an asset chapter 7 or a chapter 13 then the debt is not discharged unless the creditor has notice, even if it is late notice, so the creditor can file a claim and receive a distribution on its debt.\nSo to determine what the possible problems could be, first you must determine if there are non exempt assets.",
        "I can't speak for other attorneys, but I always pull a \"tri-merge\" credit report to supplement the information the client gives me. You would be surprised at what shows up, like the client who apparently had six separate birth dates in six different cities in Mexico. (turns out his wallet containing his social security card was stolen on a job site.)",
        "When debts are sufficiently old, they are no longer collectible and technically, there is no need to include them in a bankruptcy. As a bankruptcy lawyer, I can help by pulling a credit report but I can't read your mind or live your life, so it is up to the client to provide me with their debts. I may be the Wicked Stepmother here, but honestly, if it isn't important to you to provide me with complete information, why should I go hunting down your debts? Unless you want to pay me to hire a professional investigator, but that will probably double my fee! Hope this perspective helps!",
        "It is the responsibility of the client to provide the information regarding all the debts owed to the attorney. Often times the best way to do this is to provide the attorney with all the bills received in the mail. Additionally, a credit report is very useful. Some attorneys provide this as a service. You can always obtain a credit report yourself and give it to the attorney.",
        "It isn't the lawyer's responsibility so they don't have to \"discover\" anything. We might give hints on what to do, some facilitate getting credit reports, etc., but in the end it is the client's responsibility."

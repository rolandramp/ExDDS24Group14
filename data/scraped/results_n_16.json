    "title": "I am the plaintiff of an unlimited civil lawsuit. One of the defendants is a big corporation that filed & exited Chapter 11",
    "question": "And now has a new owner & is still very much in business still using the old DBA. The lawsuit was filed before the corp filed Chapter 11 but by the time the corp exited Chapter 11 & found a new owner the lawsuit still didn't progress at all because of the automatic stay. Now the corp is trying to convince the judge that I am entitled to nothing because I failed to file a \"notice to claim\" while instead they didn't tell me I could so now I am having a really hard time understanding if I could just sue the new owner of the corp or sue for a different type of tort since the corp got away with a lame\"plaintiff didn't ask for any$\". I'd love a 2nd opinion to understand if I could either sue the new owner or sue for a different tort like fraud since the corp deprived me of the possibility to get a cent from them & they are getting away with everything & trying to get dismissed while the lawsuit was & still is at a very early stage so of course there was never any \"debt\" to be wiped out because the lawsuit didn't progress at all. If by any chance I cannot sue the new owner for a tort that happened under the old owner what kind of cause of action I may have right now against the new owner?",

        "I agree with Attorney Espada. Put all the notices you have in chronological order and find an attorney to review to see if you waived your rights to pursue by not filing a Proof of Claim. The Court's docket will show an declaration of service on all entities on the matrix at the addresses set forth therein as well , in addition to any notice sent out advising of the need to file a claim , etc. THus, obtain all you can in order to reduce the time for your attorney to have to locate all and review. Then you can see if you retain any rights to proceed further or whether you write it off as business expense on taxes hopefully. Good luck and thanks for asking on AVVO. PS: There are GREAT bankruptcy attorneys in CA that answer all the time so find one that practices ch 11 and obtain that advice.",

        "Always be sure to choose an attorney whom you have confidence in. There are many attorneys out there, and you may be tempted to choose the one with the lowest attorney fee, but understand that that decision may have ramifications. Many times, an attorney can charge less because they have \"volume\" (a huge caseload, but that can lead to a less-personalized attention towards your case and, perhaps, a missed appointment. So, always do your homework on who you are hiring.\n\n[This communication is intended as general information and not specific legal advice, and this communication does not create an attorney-client relationship.]",

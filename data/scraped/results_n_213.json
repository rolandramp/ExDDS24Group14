    "question": "An attorney firm handled my recent BK case; BK was discharged. However, the firm mishandled the Reaffirmation Agreement with the finance company for my car. Namely, they did not send the signed agreement back to the finance company, and they did not file it with the court. As a result, the finance company told me that they will no longer report my payments with the credit bureaus. I am now on what they called: pay and retain. I have 2 questions:",

        "Reaffirming is not just an agreement between you and the creditor. The judge must also approve a reaffirmation, and many judge's won't do this. While many creditors seem to promise that they will report your payments on a vehicle if you reaffirm, this promise often turns out to be empty. I have seen plenty of situations in which the creditor pockets the reaffirmation and never follows through with the promise to report. When you look for the promise to report, it turns out it isn't there. The benefits to your credit by having these payments reported is of minimal value to your credit score. Hope this perspective helps!",
        "Leases need to be assumed rather than reaffirmed. Lease assumption is not governed by the same deadlines as reaffirmation. Some judges will reopen a case if needed, and that might be an option. Finally, odds are you are better off without assuming the lease. Best bet, talk to the lawyer and hopefully this can get fixed.",
        "Atty Michel has given you good legal and practical advice. The failure to process a Reaffirmation agreement is not the end of the world. Creditors overplay the practical benefit of having your payments reported on your credit file. You can fix this by adding a \"consumer statement\" to your credit report by simply stating you have made all your payments on time, but the creditor refused to report them. Invite anyone seeing your credit report to contact you for verification of the accuracy of your statement. You will accomplish what the creditor refused to do and you will most likely never have to prove your consumer statement. Good luck and God bless.",
        "OK, well first of all you cannot reaffirm a lease. There is no such thing. You can do a lease assumption if required by the creditor, which does not need to be filed with the court. It is simply an agreement to be bound by the terms of the lease agreement.\n\nRetain and pay is the best of all possible worlds. You get discharged from the debt so that in the event you default on the lease payments in the future or have lease end fees, you do not have to pay anything extra after you turn in the vehicle.\n\nIf credit reporting is your main concern, you can self-report your payments, which is what I advise my clients to do. (Just Google \"self report credit\" to find companies that will assist with this).\n\nI don't know what your agreement with your attorney provided, but given that you are able to keep your vehicle and can self-report your payments, I don't see any damages--quantifiable or otherwise--which you would be able to seek in a malpractice suit.",
        "You should argue that any money owed at end of lease is discharged as a pre-petition debt because it relates to the pre-petition contract. Different judges may disagree and this could take some sophisticated argument.\n\nThe finance company will likely take your money and let you keep driving so long as you keep paying.\n\nAs to the attorney, if you paid for the lawyer to handle the reaffirmation (many lawyers specifically exclude this from representation), you might try a fee arbitration with the State Bar or a Small Claims case to get a partial refund of the attorney fee you paid."

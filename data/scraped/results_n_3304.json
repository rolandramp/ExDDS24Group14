    "title": "Am I responsible for a student loan that I cosigned on if the borrower and I have been divorced?",
    "question": "In 2007 I cosigned on a student loan through Sallie Mae for my husband at the time. In 2008 I filed for divorce due to his abuse and filed for bankruptcy. Due to his non appearance (He left CA and moved out of the country) my divorce wasn't finalized until 2009. He has since defaulted on his loan and I am getting called by bill collectors for it. Is there anything I can do to resolve myself of his debt?",

        "Agree with colleagues. Yes. You are liable because you co-signed the loan. Check dissolution judgment to see if loan assigned to other spouse. You may have an action for reimbursement by other spouse created by the dissolution judgment. It is possible, though very difficult to discharge the student loan obligation in BK if you can demonstrate undue hardship. Need more facts to opine further.",
        "I agree with all attorneys who previously posted responses to your question. I write separately to point out a special provision in Chapter 13 Bankruptcy. While student loan debt is typically nondischargeable, it is possible under Chapter 13 if you meet certain criteria. See 11 USC ยง523(a)(8). I am confident that the 9th Circuit has addressed the issue. Talk to a local bankruptcy attorney and see if it is possible in your case. You indicated that you filed for bankruptcy in 2008. If that is the case, you could file a new Chapter 13. Your attorney would then have to file an Adversary Proceeding to Determine whether you qualify. This is an uphill and losing battle for most debtors. If you go down this road, find an attorney with experience discharging student loans in bankruptcy. Due to the low number of qualified debtors, this definately a provision of the code that gets little use.\nIf you cannot discharge the debt, you may also have a claim against him. Whether that claim could be collected would be an entirely different question.\nBest of luck.",
        "Precious few things, you signed the note and will be considered just as liable as your ex-husband. Sometimes, the parties can settle as to some debts in the divorce court. If you parties did not settle the student loan debt in the divorce court, you have no option but to pay the debt, especially if it was guaranteed.",
        "Yes as a cosigner you are on the hook.",
        "Yes, because you consigned. None of the other facts matter as it relates to your liability to repay the creditor.\n\nYour facts may allow you to go after your ex for reimbursement of monies you had to pay to the creditor.\n\nJonathan Leventhal\nLeventhal Law Group, P. C.",
        "The student loan people can contact you for payment is you co-signed the loan. Co-siging the loan makes you just as responsible for the loan as the borrower. What does your Divorce Decree say about the debt? What Chapter did he file? More information is needed to answer your questions.",
        "the divorce does not negate your responsibility since you also signed on the loan"

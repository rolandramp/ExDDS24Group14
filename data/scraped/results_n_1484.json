    "title": "Can an arbitration judgment be sold?",
    "question": "My family has been through a lot after the death of a child in my family from a drunken driver. In arbitration a judgment was given for damages. Can this judgment be sold to a party to avoid the process of waiting for the collection of the judgment? It has already been a year since the judgment was given. If there is such a party that will do this do you know of any?",

        "You should be able to sell or assign your arbitration judgment. If not done already, it might first need to be converted to an actual judgment and not just an arbitration award. Selling it might not be your best bet. Find a good collection attorney and talk to him or her about your options.",
        "Mr. Stein covered the major points very well. There are many debt buyers of corporate type debts, but fewer of this type of judgment. Be sure you proceed cautiously since you are likely to get some lowball offers. The more you know about the defendant to the judgment, the better someone else can assess the value. Some investigation work could really improve how much you get.",
        "I extend my heartfelt condolences on your grievous, unnecessary loss. Yes, you can sell the judgment. Whether anyone would be willing to buy it, and at what price, would depend on an analysis of the collectibility of the judgment, which in turn relates to available insurance, any defenses any insurer might have to paying out on any policy, as well as the financial condition of the drunk driver and any other responsible parties. Be careful not to give it away for a quick check, as any buyer is likely to offer less than is available to collect. It's OK to just get what you can I f you don't see a possibility of a substantial collection in the future, and just want to end the misery. Bankruptcy and personal injury lawyers in your area may be able to help you find buyers. You might want to hire a financial consultant to guide you through assessing the value of the judgment, and exposing it to the market in a way that maximizes the proceeds of a sale. Good luck, and I wish you peace."

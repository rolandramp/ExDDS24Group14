        "There are a number of things that determines whether a particular income tax debt is dischargeable, timing is one of them. I recommend you consult a local bankruptcy attorney to get more information.",
        "You will not be able to eliminate these taxes in bankruptcy yet as they seem to be incurred within the last 3 years. You do have the option of filing a chapter 13 which is a repayment plan for the tax debt. It is a 3-5 year payment plan depending on your income and assets. This would be a good option if you have other debt you need to take care of. If you do not then I would recommend just establishing a payment plan with the IRS directly.",
        "You can't wipe out income taxes that were incurred in the last three years. However, the IRS is pretty good about setting up payment plans. I suggest that you respond to their letters and work out a payment plan. Nevertheless, bankruptcy may be an option to get rid of the other debts that you have. I also suggest that you engage a relationship counselor and a financial planner to get your personal and financial life in order.",
        "If you owe taxes from tax year 2017 then it is likely too recent to wipe it out in a bankruptcy. Bankruptcy will wipe out most of your other debts you have which may make it easier for you to payback the IRS. If you would like to discuss more then I suggest scheduling a phone consultation with one the many great bankruptcy attorneys here on AVVO.",
        "I've changed the practice area to Bankruptcy."

        "The case summary indicates that your spouse filed a Petition for Dissolution of Marriage, served you with it, and you did not respond. Thereafter, your spouse requested a Default Judgment, which means that he/she requested the divorce without your participation, and the judge granted the request. According to the facts you provided, the divorce was granted as of 7/23/12.\n\nIf you do not care about what the terms of the divorce are, then you do not have to do anything. However, you risk that your spouse obtained court orders regarding child custody and visitation, child support, spousal support, and division of the assets and debts, which you may not like. Only a family law attorney will be able to explain it all to you. If you are curious, then you will need to hire an attorney to review your paperwork. There may be a chance to set the judgment aside, but only an experienced family law attorney will be able to determine if that is possible. I am including links below which you may find helpful. Good luck.",
        "Based on the information set forth in your question, reflecting that Judgment was entered over 6 months after the Respondent was served Ii.e., your Proof of Service was filed on January 20, 2012 so service must have been on or before that date), your marital status was dissolved (i.e., you were divorced) on July 23, 2012.",
        "Judgment means you are divorced. The actual date it is effective will be listed on the Notice of Entry of Judgment. It will either have a specific date or it will say \"date of entry of udgment\" whch means 7/23/12."

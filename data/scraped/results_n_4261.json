        "Your first consultation should NOT be with a bankruptcy attorney. It is with a tax attorney. In my experience, you have to carefully analyze each line and contest what is wrong. The tax authorities will likely apply amounts in their favor, not yours.\n\nOnce your case has gone through appeals and your case is settled, then the bankruptcy attorney can analyze the five tests in discharging those taxes in bankruptcy.",
        "You didn't say whether your business is a corporation or sole proprietorship, or whether you wish to continue operating the business. Also, the devil is in the details which are more than could be discussed here. But in general, even if taxes are too recent to be discharged in bankruptcy, the penalties are usually dischargeable in bankruptcy. I recommend that you consult with a qualified bankruptcy attorney in your area ASAP to discuss your entire financial situation.",
        "Make a consult with a bankruptcy attorney. There are many collateral issues that all affect one another and a broader election to do bankruptcy."

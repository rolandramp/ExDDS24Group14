        "The first answer is correct in that the purpose is to provide full and fair financial disclosure. You fill out the FL150, FL142, and FL140. Serve each on your spouse by mail. You file the FL150 and FL142, but you don't file the FL140.\n\nYour spouse is required to serve these forms on you as well. If they don't you can file a motion with the court asking them to compel your spouse to exchange this information.\n\nIf you don't have copies of your tax returns, I would suggest contacting the IRS. You will have to send them their Form # 4506. You can find it at the link provided below.\n\nIf you have no kids and relatively little assets, you should look online and see if you qualify for summary dissolution. It would be faster, cheaper and easier for both you and your spouse.",
        "The purpose of these forms is to make a full and accurate disclosure to your spouse of all assets and debts, as well as income, so that the spouse and/or court can determine a fair and equal division as well as calculate support, if that becomes an issue.\n\nPlease note that this answer does not constitute legal advice, and should not be relied on, as each situation is fact specific, and it is not possible to evaluate a legal problem without a comprehensive consultation and review of all the facts and court pleadings filed in the case. This answer does not create an attorney-client relationship"

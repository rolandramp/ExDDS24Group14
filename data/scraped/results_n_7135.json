    "title": "Can a $20,000 CA EDD overpayment be discharged in bankruptcy?",
    "question": "I lost my appeal on receiving UI benefits while living overseas and looking for work there and back in the states via the Internet. They say I owe $20,000 in overpayments and penalties. I spent this money to live, am still unemployed, and have no way to pay back the $900 a month they want for the next two years. I have nothing left to lose except a 401(k) account. Can I discharge this EDD debt via a bankruptcy filing?",
    "answers": [
        "Generally speaking, government overpayments that are not the result of fraud can be discharged in bankrutpcy, but there are many exceptions. With this amount of money at stake, you really need the help of a bankruptcy lawyer. Given your finances, you should seek out a legal aid organization that might be able to refer your case to a lawyer who could handle it at no or low cost.",
        "Yes you may discharge it, unless there is a basis of fraud argument. Good luck.",
        "Unemployment overpayment is not a tax or a fine, so it is dischargeable in bankruptcy unless the California EDD objects to the discharge of that debt, presumably on the basis of fraud (for example, that the overpayment was due to false information submitted by the debtor)."

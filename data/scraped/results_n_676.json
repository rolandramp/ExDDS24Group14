    "title": "What is the actual statute of limitations on a medical debt collection in the State of California?",
    "question": "In 2013 Providence Hospital charged cancelled insurance under my former married last name, and ignored my new and current insurance as well as my name change. I asked the cashier why he had the paperwork in my former name and if he had the correct insurance. He stated he did and that it was because my \"Profile\" was not updated. Months go by and I receive a bill in the mail under my married name, I called the hospital billing and they had said that once my \"profile\" was updated the claim will be sent to the correct insurance. The next month I received a collections call. I called the hospital and they gave a the run around. The collections did not want to work with me. It has been 5 years and I thought the statute of limitations applied to this type of debt. Collection Consultants claim it is 7 years and refused to give me the state statute that states their claim.",

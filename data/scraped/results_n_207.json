    "title": "Is an Inheritance of proceeds from a house sale from a Revoc Trust considered a gift and exempt from the 180 day rule in CA?",
    "question": "My brother passed away on June 5, 2020 and through his revocable living trust left his son the sale proceeds from his primary residence. His son finalized his bankruptcy in May 2020. Would the sale proceeds qualify as a gift from the trust and be exempt for the 180 day inclusion rule in California Bankruptcy for the son?",
    "answers": [
        "This is precisely the type of asset defined in Section 541(a)(5)(A) (the \"180-day rule\"). If the person had a right to the property with 180 days of filing, it is property of the estate. That generally means if the deceased passed away within that 180 days, not when the property was distributed.\n\nThis applies in chapter 7 and chapter 13. Additionally, chapter 13 would make this inheritance an asset of the bankruptcy estate any time while the case is still pending, under Section 1306.",
        "Not an easy answer. Your nephew needs discuss this with his bankruptcy attorney. If he didn't have an experienced one, he needs one now.",
        "More information is needed to give you useful advice. What kind of BK did your brother file? 7 or 13? When was his case filed with the BK court? Did your son discuss this with his BK lawyer? Depending on the answers you give, the real issue is whether or not the BK trustee has a claim of the inheritance.",
        "An inheritance is not exempt from the 180-day rule.\nHe needs to talk to an attorney.\nHe has not received the proceeds yet. Notice has to be given to all beneficiaries and they have 120 days to contest the trust. Also, the house has to be sold and debts paid. Depending on the decedent's financial situation, it may be a year before distribution is made."

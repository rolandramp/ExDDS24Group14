    "title": "I'm suing defendants for elder fraud but they say the claim is discharged by their 2010 bankruptcy.",
    "question": "In June 2012, I discovered defendants have been defrauding me since 2009. I filed a complaint for actual fraud, deceit, elder fraud in the California superior court. Defendants argue that my claim is discharged by their 2010 Chapter 7 no-asset bankruptcy (filed in Virginia, discharge date August 2010). Although they committed the fraud actions starting BEFORE their bankruptcy, I believe my claims are not discharged because they concealed the acts so well that I didn't discover till this year. And also they were continuing the conduct till May 2012. Claims based on actual fraud are not dischargeable, so they argue I have to go to the bankruptcy court (in Virginia) to sue them, even though the bankruptcy case is closed. Any information would be helpful.",

        "Your claims are likely discharged by the bankruptcy, but there are alternative ways in which you could potentially resolve your issue.\n\nI would recommend you look into the Victims of Corporate Fraud Compensation Fund to try to recoup at least a portion of your money. Also you may want to try to contact some other clients/individuals who were also defrauded by the individuals who defrauded you.\n\nMy firm handles class actions involving elder financial abuse where a fraudster defrauded over 6,000 individuals, then declared bankruptcy. We have been successful with our class of 500 in successfully recouping much of their money from the Fund that I mentioned above.\n\nIf you need some more help, please contact my office for a free consultation. (916) 444-8240 or shoot me an email. Thank you and good luck.",
        "Be careful what you do, as it is possible pursuing someone for a claim involving a bankrupt party could be a violation of the automatic stay, even when the bankruptcy has already been discharged.\nYou need to talk to a bankruptcy attorney. You may need to re-open the chapter 7 and file an adversary action or motion for relief from stay. These are complicated issues. Do not take this on by yourself.",
        "To the extent that there was any ongoing fraud after the bankruptcy filing date, the claim remains viable. If you had notice of the bankruptcy, any fraud claims existing at the time of filing are discharged.\n\nDischarge of debts for unlisted creditors in a no-asset case is a little trickier. You need to contact a bankruptcy attorney Virginia to answer that part of this question.\n\nUnlisted debts normally survive a BK. However, many federal circuits have a adopted a \"no harm, no foul\" rule when it comes to unlisted claims and they are discharged. In the 9th Circuit, failure to list the debt would allow the state court to decide the fraud issue, but the law in Virginia may be different.",
        "This is a complicated area of law, in itself not resolvable with the public even the most knowledgable Avvo attorneys can provide. But your facts indicate you are already exposing yourself to sanctions for a discharge violation. Nothing short of the advice and probably representation by an experienced bankrtupcy attorney will meet your needs. It will take a careful review of the facts to determine whether the debt is of the type excepted from discharge. If you do not know such a lawyer, use the attorney-finder at www.nacba.org. I am a longtime proud member of NACBA, and trust my CA colleagues to advise accurately.\n\nBest wishes for a favorable outcome, and please remember to designate a best answer."

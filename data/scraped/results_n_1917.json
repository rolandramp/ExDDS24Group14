        "Yes. The personal guarantee can be dissolved in BK. This is separate action from discharging the debts resulting from the personal guarantee. Should not be confused with discharge of liability for debts personally guaranteed before BK filed.\nListing the debts on your BK petition and schedules will discharge liability for all dischargeable debt incurred before filing as result of personal guarantee.\nBe sure to dissolve the personal guarantee to prevent liability for post petition debts incurred after filing and discharge.",
        "If you're in a true partnership, you were already personally liable for all the partnership's debts without the guarantee. If you're in some type of limited liability entity, you weren't personally liable until you signed the guarantee. But the guarantee probably creates liability only to the other two partners. Outside creditors cannot benefit from this. Regardless, your own personal bankruptcy would discharge your liability from all these obligations. I'd recommend you personally consult with an attorney to review the documents and the entity legal structure for a more precise answer in your particular case. In some circumstances, you might address your situation with a less drastic remedy than bankruptcy.",
        "Personally guaranteed what. More facts are needed. Personal guarantees can be wiped out in bankruptcy. But the business deal and the documents should be reviewed by an experienced business and bankruptcy attorney who would then be able to give sound legal advice.",
        "In most states, in a partnership, all partners are each responsible for paying all the debts of the partnership. It does not matter if the name is on the debt or not. Individuals can eliminate business debts through bankruptcy, if eligible. However, businesses cannot receive a discharge through bankruptcy and any attempt to pursue bankruptcy on behalf of the partnership by itself would be foolish. Unless the partners are married to each other, they cannot jointly file bankruptcy either. Unless polygamy becomes legal - LOL! Hope this perspective helps!",
        "If by dissolved, you are asking can the obligation to pay any of the partnership debt by one of the partners that is responsible to pay the debt be discharged by a bankruptcy discharge in a bankruptcy proceeding, the answer is probably. As Mr. Fraley said, it is done all the time.\n\nHowever, all the debt can be determined to be nondischargeable if a creditor that will be adversely affected by the discharge of the debt objects on the grounds that the obligation is nondischargeable on the grounds that are set forth in §§ 523(a)(2), (4) or (6) and the court rules in favor of the creditor. There are other grounds that the obligation could be considered nondischargeable even though the creditor does not object in the bankruptcy proceeding. Finally, some of the reasons the debt would be nondischargeable in a chapter 7 or chapter 11 bankruptcy would not apply in a chapter 13 bankruptcy.",
        "Ths simple answer is YES. It is done all the time. bankruptcy terminates contractual obligations."

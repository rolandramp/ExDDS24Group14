        "If the RV is deemed to be a vehicle by the DMV, then your exemption would be under CCP 703. The maximum exemption(s) under this code is $28,225, The homestead exemptions of CCP 704, which vary from $75,000 to $175,000, are for residences; residential homes, mobile homes that are fixed to the land, like in a trailer park. I strongly urge you to consult with a lawyer, who would need details before a definite answer could be given you. The more information you provide, the better answer you will be given.",
        "First, no attorney can really advise you if it is exempt or not ! Why? Because we don't know if you have lived in CA more than the last 2 years . If not, another state's law will govern unless you also lived in CA before the 2 year rule also possibly depending on how long!\n\nSecond, assuming you did live in CA more than 2 years, you have an excellent CA attorney who have seen many great answers throughout the last 2 years showing his superb knowledge.

But the most important thing is to meet with an\nattorney as you asking this question means you have not. You care about 2 goals: keeping\neverything you have equity in and discharging all your debts. If you don't have any of the\nexceptions to discharge you will obtain that goal; most exceptions are set forth in 11 USC. 523\n(Google it) like child support, some income taxes, traffic (in a ch 7) and criminal fines , and\npresumption of student loans.

Just one example: If you paid back a\nrelative $3,000 11 months ago and now file bankruptcy next week, the trustee can SUE that\nrelative to retrieve that $3,000 (under what is called a preference) for the benefit of the\nbankruptcy estate.

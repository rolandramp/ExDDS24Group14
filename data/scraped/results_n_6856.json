    "title": "Credit Report False Reporting - Can I sue ?",
    "question": "Recently I noticed on my credit report that I have a $10k account in collections since last September. The debt is not mine ! When I called the company, they told me to send in my credit report which \"has my SS # on the front page.\" I had to pull my credit report from three places and NONE had my SS# on it. I called them back and after 10 min on the phone I offered to send in my SS card which has my real SS # on it.",

        "If you found an account on your credit report that does not belong to you, there are generally two possible reasons, and both require swift action. One, you may be the subject of a mixed file at the level of the credit reporting agencies, or two, the victim of identity theft. There are very specific actions you can take with regard to either issue, and they both start with a dispute of the account to the consumer reporting agencies. Your initial instinct to contact the creditor was correct, but this doesn't invoke some important legal protections that you have when you notify the consumer reporting agencies that the account is wrongly appearing in your consumer reports. I recommend that you make all communications in writing. Take it seriously, and be very cautious about sending any personal information to anyone at this point. I do not recommend sending it to the creditor yet. Tell the creditor that you dispute the account and ask it to validate the debt by providing you with information about it. I have more detailed information on disputing debts with creditors and consumer reporting agencies online which you may want to review--look at the Debt Collection and Credit Reporting pages. Also, you should immediately contact an attorney experienced in consumer reporting issues and debt collection matters before providing any information to the creditor. The National Association of Consumer Advocates maintains a website with a list of consumer attorneys that can certainly help you with this issue.",
        "I agree with the comments of my colleagues. I would add that you should also get your credit report from the fourth credit bureau, Innovis - you will need to contact them directly to get your credit report. Dispute the erroneous reporting with all 4 credit bureaus, in writing. Attach a fraud affidavit. Send it via certified mail return receipt requested to all 4 credit bureaus.\n\nI would recommend you consult an attorney who handles consumer credit matters before sending the dispute letters out.\n\nGood luck.",

        "It sounds like the only person who passed away is your daughter. My heartfelt condolances at your loss. We always expect our kids to outlast us. Sometimes it does not work out that way. Grief has a hard time going away, if it ever does. It does get better but there is always that hole in your heart that she filled.\n\nAs to the collectors when they call, just tell them that she died, when that happened and that they are welcome to confirm that themselves. Tell them that other than a car with no equity she did not have anything. You do not have to do a probate of her estate as there was no estate. Demand that they cease calling you about her debts as you are not responsible for them. Even if you were an \"authorized user\" on her cards, that does not make you responsible for them.\n\nThere is one thing that would concern me. If you used the cards after she died, that would be fraud and you would be liable for the debt you incurred under her name. If you did not do that you should be just fine.",
        "Sorry for your losses. No need to probate your wife's estate as she had no assets subject to probate based on what you told us. Your deceased daughter's creditors are not your responsibility. If she had no probate assets either I suggest that you send a letter to that effect to each creditor along with a copy of your daughter's death certificate."

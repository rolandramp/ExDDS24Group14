        "Our office has maintained a family law practice in Alameda and Santa Clara County for the past 31 years. I have represented several thousand of individuals in family law matters.\n\nFirst, I agree with the previous counsel's responses to your inquiry. They are on point and you don't have to worry about assets and debts that occured before marriage nor after marriage, only during the three month period of marriage. In regard to counsel's reference to half the value of the sofa you bought together during those three months, the value of the sofa would be calculated at present value, that being a used sofa not the price you paid for a new sofa. If anyone has added to a savings account during the marriage, that amount would be divided in half. If debts were incurred during the three month marriage, they would also be divided with offsets for whoever takes the property the debts are related to. If there are 401k contributions or stock rights acquired, they would have to be valued and divided for the three month period. Our office has an active family law practice in the greater Bay Area for over 31 years.\n\nJohn N. Kitta\nFremont, CA\n510-797-7990",
        "Anything you have acquired with earnings during marriage may be subject to division. anything you had prior to marriage or acquired with money you earned after the date of separation is not community property subject to division. Also gifts or inheritances you receive, even if you receive them during marriage, are separate. If everything is spent, however, and there are no assets into which you can trace that money, there may be nothing to divide",
        "My colleague is correct. Your spouse will only get what you and she acquired during the three months of the marriage. That might mean half the value of the sofa you bought together or something like that. She might even get half the value of your 401(k) contributions during the three months. This is a case where you should be able to work things out between you amicably. Don't waste money on fighting the little stuff.",
        "Community property means you are each entitled to one half of all assets and debts acquired DURING MARRIAGE. That means, anything during the 3 months. Not what was yours before the date of marriage. Not what you acquired after you separate. Just what was acquired during those 3 months. If everything you earned was used for living expenses, there will be nothing to divide."

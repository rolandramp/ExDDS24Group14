    "title": "Chapter 7 means test: Don't count social security income? Do count pension income?",
    "question": "Okay, I have job income, pension income and my wife and I have social security income. If you take away the social security I am pretty sure we pass the means test. However, once you add that number back in it appears we make decent money. Might I run into a problem. For example, I assume I need to list all types of income on the budget section of the petiton. Does it all come down to whether or not it shows extra income after the expenses.",

        "Yes, you will have problems if after doing Schedules I and J including Soc Sec there is too much left over. How much is too much? That's where you need a local, experienced attorney to tell you how much is deemed reasonable for you not to afford to pay your creditors something. Generally if what is left would allow you to pay less than 10 percent of your unsecured, dischargeable debt over 5 years, then you are probably OK with the Chapter 7. I have seen Chapter 7 cases where the debtor(s) would have been able to pay a much higher percentage However, there many other issues to consider in each case and there is no legal percentage that would guarantee that the U.S Trustee's Office and/or case trustee is/are not going to object and move for dismissal. (You cannot be forced into a Chapter 13 but you would have that as an alternative.). You really need to be represented by an experienced attorney in the case. Filing a bankruptcy petition without an attorney is dangerous and may be hazardous to your health, especially your mental health since it might keep you awake at night. Good luck.",
        "The Means Test has two parts, the first (and easy) one is whether you and your wife's past six months gross income time 2 totals more than the official California median annual income for your family size. If not, you pass and that's the end of the Means Test for you. If you don't pass that part of the Means Test, you have to do the next (and way more complex) part which is well beyond the scope of this answer. Social Security income is not counted as income for Means Test purposes, but pension income probably is (unless it too derives from the federal Social Security Act which it probably doesn't). If you fail the Means Test, you would probably be forced to use Chapter 13 (the payment plan chapter) instead of 7.\n\nThe issue of excess income less expenses (looking forward) is a separate issue. If you have significant income left after expenses (how much varies with the specific trustee and U.S. Trustee) you would also probably be forced to use Chapter 13 instead of 7.\n\nI strongly recommend that you consult with a qualified bankruptcy attorney in your area."

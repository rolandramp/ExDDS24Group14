        "You may be able to exempt these from garnishment but you really should speak with an attorney who knows the exemption laws in California. Aside from what can be exempted from garnishment there are also timing and procedural issues. I suggest you speak with a debt collection or bankruptcy attorney.",
        "You should familiarize yourself with exemption law. Theoretically anything can be garnished until you assert an exemption that protects the item. Social Security and disability payments are often protected by federal law or also by a state law that incorporates the federal exemption. Then, congress sometimes grants government creditors special rights to override the exemptions (like for student loans or taxes). Private companies generally can't override the exemptions. http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/california-bankruptcy-exemptions-property-assets.html\nBeing familiar with the procedure helps you accomplish your goal. Next you would need to see if the BAH has an exemption.",
        "Likely that any source of income, including disability from the VA can be taken for child support.

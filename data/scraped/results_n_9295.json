    "title": "Am I covered by a held harmless clause in my divorce settlement agreement, if my ex is now filing for bankruptcy?",
    "question": "I am divorced for 3 years. The settlement agreement states that I will live in the home (owned by both of us, since we did not want to sell at time of divorce) and I'd be solely responsible to pay the mortgage (which I have). It also states that my ex is solely responsible to pay for a second he took out on our home. At one point, only he was on the original loan but we refinanced and added me to the first mortgage. Thus, my name is not on the second.",

        "I agree with the other posts in the sense that an indemnity agreement is only as good as his finances. If your goal is to save the home, then you should continue to make payments on the second. If your home is upside down and the second is essentially unsecured debt, you might be able to negotiate a lien release for a lump sum payment to the lender, but would have to have the funds available to do so since they would not be interested in a payment plan.

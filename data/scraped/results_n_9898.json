    "title": "Is it possible to sue for reimbursement?",
    "question": "My dad co-signed with a cousin. My cousin crashed the car, left it on the street, it got towed and repossessed, and to top it all off he is missing. My dad is now stuck having to pay the car. My dad would like to know if he can make my cousin responsible for paying the car or if he can sue for reimbursement or something, even though my cousin is missing.",
    "answers": [
        "He can file a civil lawsuit against the cousin. He will need to file the proper papers with the court. Then he will need to have the papers personally served on the cousin. The case will either go to trial or your dad can get a default judgment if the cousin does not respond to the lawsuit. After a judgment is entered, your dad will need to collect the judgment by garnishing wages or levying upon non-exempt property. You dad will still be responsible to the creditors for obligations arising from the car.",
        "Your dad can sue the cousin. I suggest that your dad set up a consultation with a local Avvo attorney."

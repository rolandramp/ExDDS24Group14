    "title": "Filed for chapter 7 bankruptcy but i didnt include 401 k money I cashed out during the last 6 month period . Was I supposed to?",
    "question": "I just filed for a joint chapter 7 bankruptcy with my husband this February of 2018 . However , at the start of this year he started his new job that surpassed the income of a median family in California . So the lawyer filed for us on the means test calculating the last 6 month income and we passed . However, we were never told we had to include our 401 k income we cashed out in January . Were we supposed to include it ? Will this cause for our case to be dismissed ? The money is all gone , it wasn't much and was used for bills. Will this pose a problem in our chapter 7 filing ?",
    "answers": [
        "I agree with Attorney Primus although arguably interest and principal earned on said investment during the 6 months could be deemed income. But I am writing as if cashed out, you should have listed it in the Statement of Financial Affairs as transfer of asset, as well as if you paid off any creditor more than $600 in Jan then that should have been listed also. Discuss these matters with your attorney no doubt!",
        "The 401k should have been listed on your schedule of assets. Ask your attorney any further questions.",
        "You should be asking your lawyer these questions. He/she has the complete picture of your financial details. We are just guessing.",
        "This should not be a problem. The term \"income\" refers to new money generated. The money in a 401k was earned and received long ago, and not new money in the 6 month period.",
        "It depends on several things including what \"bills\" you paid."

    "title": "Question about Chapter 7 Automatic Stay?",
    "question": "I am in Chapter 7. I listed a particular creditor on my schedules, and they were also on the mail matrix. This creditor also contacted me at least 30 unique times since I filed my chapter 7 petition to harass, enforce, and collect this debt (by email). I had also emailed a copy of my petition notice to the lawyer representing this creditor the day I filed my petition. Before my chapter 7 petition date, I applied to set aside this default judgment of this creditor. The hearing date came, and this creditor attended the hearing and did not inform the state court that I was in chapter 7 and moved forward with the hearing. Should this creditor have asked the bankruptcy court to lift the stay to reply to my application and attend the hearing? I thought the bankruptcy stay applies to any effort, attempts to collect a debt from a debtor? I have all of the emails and letters that were sent to me. I also have three separate call attempts from the creditor's process server (I did a reverse lookup, and the number belongs to the process server - I created a PDF of this proof).",

        "I agree with much that has been said before me.\n\nIn general bankruptcy debtors' are entitled to an automatic stay, and a creditor who has been properly notified of the Bankruptcy filing should cease attempts to collect on the debt, including moving forward with a collection lawsuit, and sending collection correspondence. Sometimes a bankruptcy debtor is only entitled to a limited automatic stay, or no stay at all. If you filed a prior bankruptcy case with in 1 year prior the instant case, the stay is 30 days, if not extended. If (for some reason) you filed 2x cases with the year before the current case, there is no stay, unless imposed. Lastly, there is the possibility that relief from stay was obtained, but I am hearing/seeing anything in your question that would cause me to believe this is the sort of debt, where a relief from stay motion would be filed.\n\nCall your attorney, or consult with an attorney. GOOD LUCK!",

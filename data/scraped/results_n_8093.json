    "title": "How can I represent myself in an adversarial proceeding in a BK case?",
    "question": "I have filed BK and I had a lawyer do all of that. I now have an adversarial proceeding for $90k from a wealthy, litigious individual. The lawyer states that it will cost $50k just to defend it- which I do not have. As the adversarial claim is not a criminal case, IRS, fraud, or child support, it will likely be discharged I am told. How can I best defend against this claim on my own? They are asking for a 2 week trial! Which laws should I cite? What should I do? They will not settle. What happens if I lose? Can they appeal it if I win? If they do win, how is a payment plan made? I have no savings. I make 4k a mo and my bill are almost $3800 for a family of 5. What priority is this debt (is it after cost of living)? How long will I have to make payments for? If I lose my job, then what?",
    "answers": [
        "I agree with the NY Counsel. $50k sounds like a lot of money to pay for a two week trial. In the first place, even if you lose, there is no money to pay any creditor which is the basis of your Chapter 7. All the litigious creditor may be able to get is a judgment which will become active for a period of 10 years. There is no jail because the proceeding is not criminal and is not based on fraud.\n\nMy advice is buy yourself a 32 dollar Nolo Press bankruptcy book and fight the case yourself on the grounds that you are insolvent and that the adversarial proceeding undermines the bankruptcy laws, more specific the provisons of USC Tiltle 11 and Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Laws. In fact, it will not allow you to have a new start and thus encumbers the prpose of Chapter 7.\n\nIf they win the judgment, then refile for a Chapter 13 and list them as a priority creditor and pay $200 dollars for five years. if they oppose you, then go to reguilar court and have the judge assign you a payment of $150 bucks a month.\n\nGood luck and please give me a feedback if you liked my answer. Thanks",
        "An adversary proceeding is a contested matter in bankruptcy court. Many more formalities apply to adversaries than a basic Chapter 7 fililng. The federal rules of civil procedure apply, and most people who are not lawyers are unfamiliar with the rules. While you may be able to represnt yourself in the proceeding, you would do yourself a great service by contacting an attorney in your state who is familiar with the bankrupcy laws to reprsent you interests.",
        "50k for a two week truial sounds pretty stiff. Have you contacted other attorneys? It is very unlikely that the Judge will allow two weeks for a trial on a non-dischargeability issue. Have you brought a motion for summary judgment.\n\nYou are going to need an attorney."

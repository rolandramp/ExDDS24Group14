    "question": "I leased a car,and later on my friend borrowed it from me and said he will take the lease over by the end of summer,because of trust I didn't ask him to give me a written statement that he will take it over ,so now he got two tickets and didn't pay them ,tickets are for parking so they go under my name,one of them went to collection because of it, nor does he pay on time for it,and doesn't reply to my calls, and avoids me,he also excited the limit of mileage I have a year by times, my question is can I force him to take over the lease,or can I at least get the compensation,for all the troubles he made.What is the maximum penalty which can be applied towards him",

        "An agreement to be responsible for the contract or debts of another party requires a signed writing by your friend (the guarantor). To take over the lease would require the leasing company to agree in writing to transfer the agreement to your friend and release you from responsibility. Even if your friend now signs a guarantee, that does not mean the leasing company will agree to transfer the obligation to your friend, as they will want to see if your friend has good credit and steady income, otherwise you remain liable for the full lease, including any late payments.\n\nBecause the lease you wanted your friend to take over is for more than a year and it involves a vehicle worth over $500, so it must be in writing to conform with the statute of frauds. Thus, it is doubtful that you can force him to take over the lease or sue him for your damages. You trusted this person with your leased car and your credit, without anything in writing. When he turns in the car (hopefully) at lease termination, not only will they charge you for the excess mileage, but for all damage and excess \"wear and tear.\" I don't know that you will be able to win a case against him. Perhaps another attorney on Avvo will have suggestions on how to prevail on such claims for an oral agreement.\n\nBy: Robert Stempler (please see DISCLAIMER below)\nCONSUMER LAW OFFICE OF ROBERT STEMPLER\nA Professional Law Corporation"

    "question": "I am working with a debt resolution company and included in my debts is an unsecured payday loan. I am concerned they will not negotiate and how the process will work with a company with such aggressive tactics. Can they sue me or put a lien on my wages?",

        "I concur with my colleagues. Debt resolution companies are kind of a scam. The will work to settlement your debts, but charge a huge fee for their service. They are also very slow. The creditors will often file lawsuits to collect before the accounts are settlement. For most people, it makes more sense to file bankruptcy, and discontinue payment to the debt resolution companies. It is advisable to discuss your situation with a bankruptcy attorney.",
        "Your concern is warranted.\nIt is unlikely that a payday loan company will work with your debt negotiation company.\nIn the meantime, they (as well as any other creditor that's not getting paid) can sue you, garnish your wages, and levy your bank accounts.",
        "In my experience I have found that debt settlement companies put in their contracts that they won't do anything until their entire fee is paid. By the time it is, you have been sued by one or more creditors who will have taken judgments against you. You made one bad decision by borrowing from a payday loan company and compounded it by hiring a debt resolution company. Do yourself a favor and consult with an experienced bankruptcy attorney to get a fresh start.",
        "Debt settlement is a SCAM. Bankruptcy is a real and viable solution. To properly answer your questions and address your concerns, the best way to handle this is with an in person consultation with an experienced CA bankruptcy attorney. Use AVVO's Find a Lawyer tool to select a qualified attorney. Good luck. THIS IS NOT LEGAL ADVICE! YOU NEED TO SPEAK TO AN ATTORNEY WHO IS LICENSED IN YOUR STATE FOR LEGAL ADVICE. This is merely suggestions for you to think about in discussing your situation with the local attorney."

    "title": "Am I allowed to contact the Trustee or Trustee's attorney in my Chapter 7 Bankruptcy case?",
    "question": "A motion to deny the homestead on my property was granted. My attorney was supposed to file an opposition to that motion and did not. He has admitted his mistake but now we have Realtors knocking on our door ready to sell our HOME. I firmly believe our homestead was wrongly denied and we have very solid evidence as to why is our home should be exempt. Since my attorney isn't very competent, I would like to talk the the trustee or trustee attorney myself. I am not sure if I need to hire a new attorney to try to fight for my home or if it is too late, since my current attorney dropped the ball big time. I am not sure if I should even worry about trying to save my house at this point or if I need to just hire an attorney to sue my current one for malpractice. Please advise. Thank you.",

        "Ask your attorney about a motion to set aside the under Rule 60 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

        "It is impossible to know if your attorney did anything wrong from the facts presented in your question or if the situation can be fixed. it is always a good idea to consult with another local bankruptcy attorney and see if anything can be done in order to save your home.

The contact need to be made through your counsel of record. Although you do have the right to terminate your current counsel if you wish to and then contact the trustee directly, I strongly advise you to use the services of a competent bankruptcy counsel.

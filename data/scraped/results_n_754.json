    "question": "A borrower on an auto-loan was in default of their payments. The borrower then hid the security interest (car) so that the bank was unable to repossess it.",

        "I agree that the normal nondischargeability claim that a creditor would make for the contract would fail. The debt was not incurred by fraud, misrepresentation, etc (See 11 USC 523(a)(2)). However, there is a small potential for a claim of damage due to hiding the car under 11 USC 523(a)(6) for willful and malicious injury. Those damages wouldn't amount to enough, in my opinion, for a creditor to take the action, unless my doing so you caused significant damage to the vehicle.",
        "Creditor would have to bring an action in BK court (called Adversary Proceeding) and allege that debt is nondischargeable based on codes found under 11 USC 523. The fraud would have to have originated at time of contract (and carried out sometime thereafter), but I can say from experience that banks and their lawyers are quick to make crafty arguments alleging fraud as a \"squeeze\" method knowing that most Ch 7 debtors can't afford to defend themselves in an AP and have no clue how to handle them in pro se (simply in an effort to make a debt nondischargeable). Hiding a car that technically belongs to the lienholder is bad faith at minimum, theft at max (but these would need to be raised by the proper parties). Bad karma either way.",
        "I definitely agree with my colleagues as to the timing issue for nondischargeable debt. Certainly not the best idea to hide the vehicle.",
        "Based on the facts presented, I would say No, as long as you are making arrangements to surrender the vehicle as part of your bankruptcy.",
        "No ... the fraud, etc., must occur when the debt is incurred.",
        "Generally not, but it depends on the facts of the case and what has gone on during the bankruptcy particularly with respect to the vehicle. However, I strongly recommend against hiding any asset as they are all part of the bankruptcy estate once bankruptcy is filed. I suggest that if you already have an attorney you discuss this with that attorney, and if you don’t have one then reach out to one of us for a consultation"

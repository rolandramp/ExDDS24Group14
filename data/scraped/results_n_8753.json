    "title": "'Objection to discharge' and 'Motion to lift automatic stay' are they the same?",
    "question": "I did not file an 'objection to discharge' but I did file a 'motion to lift automatic stay' and the court has set a hearing date for the motion I filed. Is it a must to file an 'objection to discharge'? I guess they are both targeting 'the debt not to be discharged'. Is there any difference between this two? At this moment what shall I do? Am I on the right track?",
    "answers": [
        "A motion to lift automatic stay allows a creditor to take action on the debt, like a foreclosure. An objection to discharge is where the creditor is disputing whether the debt should be dischargeable or not. It depends on what you are trying to accomplish in the case. To answer your question more fully, as to whether you are on the right track, we would need more information regarding what you are trying to accomplish.",

    "title": "Can a corporate secretary be liable for corporate debt?",
    "question": "I was the secretary for the corporation of a business that failed almost two years ago. Today I was served with a lawsuit for the corporation, but they included the California Secretary of State Statement of Information that was filed in 2009 with my name on there as the Secretary for the corporation. The summons was served on behalf of the corporation and not me personally. From what I understand in reading the complaint and summons, the former CEO/president personally guaranteed that debt but they can't find him so they're trying to serve me on behalf of the corporation. I have no idea about this debt since the business closed almost two years ago. Can they go after me personally? Should I worry or contact an attorney?",

        "I have reviewed the response of a colleague and want to add some comforting thoughts that directly address your question. NO, as a secretary of the corporation there is no basis for holding you responsible for corporate debt. The service of process is a necessary step to a lawsuit to get the court involved. It does not involve you beyond attempting to use you as a conduit to notifying the corporation. If you know the whereabouts of any of the former directors, I advise you to notify them.",
        "I would agree with my colleague. I would add that you review any corporate documents that you have to ensure that you did not sign any personal guarantees on behalf of the company, particularly given the time-frame. It's unlikely given that you've not been personally sued; nonetheless, you want that peace of mind. I also recommend that you determine whether the corporation was formally dissolved. It is possible that the corporation was never legally dissolved and just became inactive or suspended for failure to pay taxes or failure to file the statement of information. The corporation may be unable to defend itself against the lawsuit filed against it and plaintiff may more aggressively attempt to add you as a DOE defendant under the cause of action explained by my colleague.",
        "it sounds like you were SERVED as a corporate agent of the corporation, being an officer, but not SUED as someone responsible for the liabilities.\n\nIf the corporation has no assets, then the plaintiff won't be able to get very far, maybe just an uncollectible judgment.\n\nAnd if you weren't named as a defendant, the plaintiff is not suing you. The only way you could be held liable is if there are defendant DOES named (unnamed people because the plaintiff doesn't know who did what), and you at some point get named as a DOE and the plaintiff is successful in proving that you were the \"alter ego\" of the corporation, which is difficult, since that means you signed corporate contracts under your own name, commingled your personal money with the corporation's etc.\n\nBut you were the Secretary, so you've got some connection with this corporation, and you'll at least be a witness, as well as agent for service of the complaint. See a business litigator to be on the safe side. The corporation probably agreed to indemnify you for your legal fees, but if it failed 2 years ago, that may not mean anything and you may have to pay for this yourself.",
        "It appears you were served as an officer of the corporation but not as an individual defendant. If the summons and complaint does not have your name on it, then you are not being served as an individual.\n\nThere are some instances when an individual is liable for the corporation's debts and obligations, either as a guarantor or under an \"alter ego\" theory.\n\nYou should give the summons and complaint to the CEO/President so that the corporation can timely respond. Under California law, a corporation must be represented by counsel to participate in litigation."

    "title": "Am I liable for mandatory utility bills on home that was included in Chapt 7 Bankruptcy?",
    "question": "3 years ago I filed Chapt 7 and this property was included in that BK. Since then I have not lived there and the bank would not foreclose on the property until 6 months ago. The garbage/sewer bill was accruing and being added as a lien on the property. When the property foreclosed 6 months ago the utility district sent me a bill saying I owed the back bills. Curious to see if I am personally liable for these since the home was included in the BK.",

        "Any utility service provided to the premises after the date of filing (until the date the bank became the owner) is a post-filing debt not discharged by the Ch 7. If you were moving out of the house why would you leave the utilities on? Expect this bill to follow you around for awhile unless you can work something out with the utility. If someone else lived there you may have a claim against them for the service they enjoyed at your expense.",
        "While you are the owner of a property you are liable for all utiliities and HOA dues, assessments, etc., that accrue or become due from the day afer you file BK. Such debts are post-petition and are not discharged by your BK.\n\nThe question is whether such debts were satisfied at the time of the foreclosure, as you state they became a lien on the property. Get the foreclosure records from the trustee that conducted the sale. If they weren't paid you will be liable.",
        "Unfortunately you are liable for the amount owed to the utility district after you filed your Chapter 7 petition. If you were behind on utilities prior to filing the bankruptcy and they are holding you liable for that amount as well, notify the utilities district of the time of your filing, provide your case number, and you may be able to subtract the pre-filing amount you owed from the amount that they are asking you to pay.",
        "The utility can hold you responsible for any post petition charges that accrue just as the city and county can for taxes and your HOA (if any) can hold you responsible for any HOA dues and assessments that occur after the bankruptcy but before title actually passes to someone else.",
        "While the property was included in the bankruptcy, the utility bill was not. Further, even if it was, the bankruptcy would have only discharged any money owed to the utility as of the date of the filing of that bankruptcy, not any subsequent utility uses. Therefore, whether or not the property itself was included in the bankruptcy does not make a difference here. You are personally responsible for paying the utility bills."

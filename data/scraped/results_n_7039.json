    "title": "If a CA Default Judgment is not renewed, does a filed Abstract of Judgment naturally extinguish or do you have to do something?",
    "question": "An Abstract of Judgment was filed with the Los Angeles County Clerk some 5 years after a default judgment was obtained. It is now over 10 years and the default judgment was not renewed. So, based on the CA Statute Of Limitations, the judgment is unenforceable.",

        "The judgment (default or not) cannot be enforced. Are you concerned because it was recorded and you own or are buying real estate in the County where the Abstract of Judgment was recorded? You need to talk with the title insurance company. You may need to consult an attorney who can talk with an attorney for the title company to find out exactly what the title company requires. The title company may be concerned that the judgment might have been renewed with the court but nothing recorded with the County Recorder. If all else fails, such as a demand for Release of Lien, a Quiet Title Action might be appropriate.",
        "Upon expiration of the 10-year period, all enforcement procedures must cease.\n\nAny liens such as a real property lien created by the recording of an Abstract of Judgment based upon the judgment are automatically extinguished pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure sections 683.020 and 683.030.\n\nCode of Civil Procedure section 683.020 provides:\n\n\"Except as otherwise provided by statute, upon the\nexpiration of 10 years after the date of entry of a money judgment or\na judgment for possession or sale of property:\n(a) The judgment may not be enforced.\n(b) All enforcement procedures pursuant to the judgment or to a\nwrit or order issued pursuant to the judgment shall cease.\n(c) Any lien created by an enforcement procedure pursuant to the\njudgment is extinguished.\"\n\nA real property judgment lien can also be extinguished upon recordation of an Acknowledgment of Satisfaction pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 724.060.

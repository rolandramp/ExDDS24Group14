    "title": "How does quit claiming a deed effect a bankruptcy?",
    "question": "My mother and I own our home together in California. We do not have a mortgage, as we bought the house with cash from a life insurance pay out. I have some credit card debt that I am having difficulty paying and would like to file Chapter 7 bankruptcy. Before doing so, I was hoping to quit claim my portion of the house to my mother, so that our home wouldn't be effected by the bankruptcy. How long after quit claiming, can I file for bankruptcy? Do I need to wait for a certain amount of time so that it doesn't look like I'm trying to hide assets? I am aware of California's homestead exemptions, but unfortunately my half of the house is worth more than the homestead exemption, and I want to make sure that the bankruptcy does not effect our home or the equity in it before proceeding with a bankruptcy.",

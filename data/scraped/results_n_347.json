    "question": "A creditor got a judgement and had my bank served which froze my account. The amount that the creditor was seeking (5,000K) was more than what was in the bank (3,000K) and now I am left with no money. What is the fastest way to stop the levy and have the money returned to my account as that is the money that I need to live on.",

        "One way is to have a bankruptcy filed before the funds are delivered to the creditor. You should consult with an attorney, but time is of the essence for you.",
        "You need to take advantage of a free consult from a bankruptcy attorney to review your options. depending on your exemption status you may be able to recover the money that was levied in a bankruptcy.",
        "You really need to retain an experienced bankruptcy attorney to represent you in this matter. Trying to represent yourself in Bankruptcy is unwise to put it nicely. There are both Federal and Local Rules of Bankruptcy that must be complied with. It is not merely filling out forms. To properly answer your questions and address your concerns, the best way to handle this is with an in person consultation with an experienced CA bankruptcy attorney. Use AVVO's Find a Lawyer tool to select a qualified attorney. THIS IS NOT LEGAL ADVICE! YOU NEED TO SPEAK TO AN ATTORNEY WHO IS LICENSED IN YOUR STATE FOR LEGAL ADVICE. This is merely suggestions for you to think about in discussing your situation with the local attorney."

        "You should check the notice of levy (wage garnishment) for the case number, and go look at the court file. It should contain a copy of the writ of execution being levied. The writ of execution should list the date of the judgment or order requiring reimbursement. Check the judgment or order to see why reimbursement of the public defender's fees was required. If the judgment is more than 10 years old, you should also check the court file to make sure it was renewed. You should consult with the attorney of your choice to discuss the particulars of the matter or for any specific legal advice."

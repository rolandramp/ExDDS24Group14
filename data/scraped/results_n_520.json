    "title": "My now married ex-GF filing BK for me, need help?",
    "question": "My ex-girlfriend is married, she opened loan and CC accounts under my name, I have to file BK, what can I do? I was on my way to fix my credit history, she has access to all my info due to us being together for 17 years, we have children together, I don’t want he jailed but what options do I have",
    "answers": [
        "If you do not wish to have her prosecuted for the crimes she has committed, file bankruptcy, get a fresh start and begin to rebuild your credit.",
        "Hello,\n\nI agree with my colleagues in terms of bankruptcy as an option to get rid of the debt. Going forward I recommend contacting the three credit reporting agencies (Equifax, Transunion, and Experian) to place a fraud alert on your credit to prevent your ex or anyone else from opening credit under your name. You can also pay companies to monitor your credit to prevent further fraud. Hope this helps.",
        "Since you do not want to prosecute, you will remain stuck with the debt. I see no options, other than your own BK case. And, it may now be too late to change your mind to prosecute. It's a shame, but given all the emotional issues from the length of the relationship and parenting issues, I certainly understand why you did not do anything.\n\nI do hope you will see a lawyer about handling the BK.",
        "I believe atty Firth is correct, BK is probably your best option with a fairly certain outcome. Remember, BK is more than checking boxes on forms you find online. Find/consult/hire a lawyer using the Avvo feature \"Find a Lawyer\". Make a list of 4-5 having many 5 star reviews from satisfied clients. If you don't get a prompt call back from one, go on to the next on your list. Some of us offer a free consultation by phone or in person. Take us up on it.\n\nBecause the bankruptcy process can be handled entirely by phone, email and fax, there is no need to personally visit the lawyer’s office unless you want to. Don’t be limited by the location of the BK lawyers you select.",
        "First of ll, you wonk't be jailed. We haven't had debtor prisons in this country for two hundred years. Based on your question, you have have grounds to prosecute your ex-girlfriend for fraud and identity theft, but bankruptcy may still be your best option.

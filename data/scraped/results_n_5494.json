    "question": "I had my home foreclosed on and have some pretty horrible credit. My question is can I get a series 7 license with this horrible credit?",
    "answers": [
        "I highly doubt that simply having gone through foreclosure would make it so you cannot obtain a series 7 license. Do you owe deficiency post foreclosure?",
        "Contact a local stock broker and request the information.",
        "I don't have an exact answer for you, but the issue is not so much getting the license; you should be able to \"get\" the license. The issue will be getting a broker-dealer to handle your trades."

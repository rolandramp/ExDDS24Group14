    "title": "Could mortgage company add fees and late payments to my principal during my chapter 13, & now ask me to pay lump after BK ended?",
    "question": "I filed for chapter 13 and during that time I was paying half of my mortgage payment. I then realized that the mortgage company was adding fees and late charges to my principal, which made my principal go higher than 115% during my BK. Then they changed my payments and they claim that my 7 year arm did not apply anymore because I went over 115% during the 7 years. That added more fees and now they want me to pay almost $80k to get out of this mess, barely a year after my chapter 13 has ended. Is this legal? Could they add all those fees during my BK?",
    "answers": [
        "Personally, I have never seen a chapter 13 which allowed the debtor to make half mortgage payments as part of the plan. Usually, chapter 13 plans are used to allow the debtor to get caught up on mortgage arrearages. Maybe you had one of these \"pick a pay\" loans which allowed you to pay less than the scheduled amount in which case the bankruptcy plan would not have offered any protection from the accrued interest. I strongly urge you to discuss this with your bankruptcy attorney. If you didn't have one, now you know why you should have.",
        "Once your Chapter 13 plan was confirmed, you would have been responsible for keeping up with the post-petition payments. Absent any loan modification or similar change to the loan, the contractual obligation would remain in effect. Late charges and fees exist in a typical mortgage when you don't make the payments on time. You may be eligible to go back into a Chapter 13 if you are unable to resolve the issues. Consult with your prior attorney or consult with a local bankruptcy attorney in your area.",
        "In reviewing your question, I have to say that I have not heard of a situation where the creditors actually will accept half a mortgage payment. Typically in Chapter 13, you as the debtor are required to make a full mortgage payment and in addition a \"plan payment\" in order to catch up on the arrears of your mortgage. Once the plan is confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court, if you stick to the plan for the designated and court order time period you should receive a discharge of your unsecured debts. The question that you asked as to whether a mortgage company can add fees and late payment to principal, it appears that they most proabably can because you where not paying a full regular mortgage payment. You definately should consult your attorney who filed the case for you.",
        "This is a question for your BK lawyer who is in possession of all the relevant documents, including the Proof of Claim filed by the mortgage company supported by copies of the note, mortgage, and any riders. Any responses from Avvo lawyers would be mostly guesswork."

        "My collegaues are correct. If you have permission from the credit card holder, it is legal. I would also make sure that you and your friend have a clear understanding of the arrangement -- it never hurts to have it in writing in case anything comes up.",
        "The short answer is \"Yes\" as long as the credit card holder understands he is responsible for payment if you don't reimburse him.",
        "Someone can put on their credit card any debt that they want, within the limit of the account.\n\nHowever, I have seen problems later where the cardholder claims that they did not authorize anyone to use their credit card. I would advise you to have the cardholder be on the phone when they authorize a charge to it, rather than you do it with the information. Before you know it, they can turn around and claim that you were never authorized to use the card, you did it on your own. It gets very ugly after that. Alternatively, get a notarized statement that they will allow you to charge this on their credit card up to a certain amount.\n\nRobert Stempler (please see DISCLAIMER below)\nwww.StopCollectionLawsuits.com\nwww.facebook.com/SoCalConsumerLawyer\nTwitter: @RStempler"

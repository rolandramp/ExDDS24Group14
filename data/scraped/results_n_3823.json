        "Yes, it's possible. If there is a deficiency between what your car sells for and what's owed, then they can come after you for the difference. But to get a garnishment, they need to sue you first. Depending on the amount, they may or may not decide to sue. You can always try to get a foreberance or a getting a payment reduction from the creditor if you lost your job. If that does not work, try settling with them. Bottomline is that until they sue you, you don't need to worrry about wage garnishment. I'd reach out to the lender and try to work something out before it gets that far.",
        "As always, attorney Larkin has done a great job of describing the process. The only thing that I would add is that it may be possible to negotiate a reduction of the deficiency balance due after the vehicle is sold. It is possible to negotiate the deficiency due prior to a lawsuit. You may want to seek the opinion of both a bankruptcy attorney and a debt settlement attorney in your area to discuss your options. It's always a good idea to know all of your options before you decide which route to take.",
        "What they will do is auction off the vehicle (they first have to serve you with notice of the right to redeem it, which you can ignore if you don't want the vehicle). After they auction off the vehicle they can then sue you for the deficiency owed - the remainder due on the loan that was not paid out of the sales proceeds. You might want to consult with a bankruptcy attorney in your area who can advise you whether filing bankruptcy may be the best solution. Many of us give free consultations."

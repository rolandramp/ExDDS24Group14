    "title": "Why did Bank of America give me a 1099A if they sold my 2nd mortgage to a debt collection agency anyway? Can they do both?",
    "question": "My house in California foreclosed last year. Now a debt collecting agency is collecting on my 2nd mortgage (refinanced) which they bought from Bank of America. Can Bank of America have it both ways by giving me a 1099A AND also sell my debt to a collecting agency?",

        "If this was your primary residence, the 1099a income may not be taxable. Look at form 982 and instructions. If you took cash out on a refinance, that amount may be taxable. This is something you need a tax adviser on. To answer your direct question, yes they can do that.",
        "Yes, they could do both.\n\nForm 1099-A is Acquisition or Abandonment of Secured Property. Form 1099-C is Cancellation of Debt.\n\nForm 1099-A is needed to report the foreclosure on your tax return. A foreclosure is treated as the sale of property, and you will need it to calculate your gain or loss on the property.\n\nForm 1099-C is used if the lender both foreclosed on the property and canceled any mortgage debt.

If box 5 of Form 1099-A was not checked, you have \"non-recourse\" debt, which means the foreclosure satisfies the bank's debt.

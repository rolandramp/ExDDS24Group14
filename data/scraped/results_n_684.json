        "Sounds like you have a lot of debt (65k), creditor harassment, and a debt collection lawsuit. I think it is time you find yourself a good bankruptcy attorney. The fee of hiring a bankruptcy attorney would probably be well worth the money considering your financial situation. Bankruptcy wipes out your debt and will likely make your lawsuit go away. Probably a good idea for you to speak with a bankruptcy attorney ASAP.",
        "If you are within 150% of poverty in your county you can have at least the filing fee waivd. That's $335.00 at the moment you can pay toward legal fees. I would strongly advise getting legal help because iof the many pitfalls in representinng yourself.",
        "You don't need to be scared but you do need to take action. You should seek a consultation with a knowledgeable bankruptcy attorney right away.\nYou have choices. It is better to make informed choices. It will cost you to respond to the State Court Collections lawsuit and you may not have a defense. Will other creditors also file lawsuits? Do you have money in the bank that you need to pay your basic necessary expenses and secured debts? Do you need all of your wages to support yourself and your family? What will bankruptcy cost and what will it remedy? Do you have a lot of equity in your home? An attorney who knows this area of the law can advise you so you can make informed decisions.",
        "In a normal bankruptcy, there are no court appearances. There IS a meeting in front of your Trustee (not a judge and often not even an attorney) at which your creditors are invited but none ever show up (hardly). As for the cost, it sounds like whatever it is - it's worth it to get this over with and be debt free.",
        "Most bankruptcy attorneys offer a free initial consultation for chapter 7 filings and quite a few accept payment plans. Use the find a lawyer tab on AVVO to find a local experienced attorney. You are not likely to have to go to court in front of people. In most circumstances for a chapter 7 you meet with the bankruptcy trustee and your attorney and that is the only appearance necessary."

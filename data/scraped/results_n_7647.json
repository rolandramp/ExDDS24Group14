    "title": "Can a private student loan go into default while a Chapter 7 bankruptcy case is open?",
    "question": "I filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in April 2011. At the time of my filing, my loan was 3-4 months past due, but it had not defaulted. I had spoken with a representative from the student loan company about a month into the bankruptcy and was told that the loan would not default while the bankruptcy case was still open, but after the discharge I would receive a letter indicating that it was in repayment. My bankruptcy discharged mid August 2011. After the discharge I called to make a payment and was informed that the student loan defaulted, effective July 2011. I would like to know whether it is legal for a student loan to default while a person is in Chapter 7 bankruptcy, as I thought the automatic stay would have prevented this.",

        "The definition of default is debateable or more precisely defined by whomever is using it. You were in default when you were 3-4 month behind at the time of filing (my definition). The fact that the student loan company labeled you or the loans in \"default\" after you contacted them later is irrelevant (their definition). If you weren't paying on your student loans, which you apparently knew were not dischargeable, you knew you were only falling further behind. So while bankruptcy protects you from many things with regards to the collection of debt, it does not provide permission to you falling further behind on non-dischargeable debt without consequences.",
        "The automatic stay was in place until discharge so, without lift of stay having been granted by the bankruptcy court, it could not have legally been defaulted before the discharge. You can fight them to get it corrected.",
        "If you did not receive your discharge until mid August, 2011, this means your case was still open and the automatic stay was still in effect when the student loans went into default in July. You are correct in that the automatic stay prohibits even student loan creditors from collecting on debts while the bankruptcy case is still open, absent a bankruptcy court order allowing them to do so. Once your bankruptcy was filed, the student loan company should have placed your loans in forbearance status until the case terminated and the stay lifted. The default status as of July is an indication that they failed to do this. It sounds like things fell through the cracks on their end. Have your attorney send them a letter demanding a correction."

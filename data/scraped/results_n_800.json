        "When parties are married in California (where I practice) I recommend that both parties file. I recommend this because we incorporate both parties income, and assets and the price doesnt change in my office. Additionally, if one party files and another realizes they have enough debt to file at a later date you just doubled the attorneys fees by paying for 2 bankruptcies. Additionally, this will allow you to rebuild your credit quicker than letting the debt follow the non-filing party in most circumstances. I find many people want only 1 spouse to file to save the nonfiling party's credit. Often its not worth it and you will rebuild quicker with a bankruptcy than without.",

        "Credit card companies may not sue your wife to collect on a credit card where she is not legally responsible for the debt. As for the debt in both of your names, the creditors can collect from both of you. If you are thinking about filing a bankruptcy, it sounds like you will want to consider filing a joint case, so that all bills are covered. Assuming you don't have equity positions in your assets that exceed the statutory exemptions in your state, and that you pass the means test and other hurdles relating to eligibility, you may qualify to file a joint Chapter 7 and keep both of your cars through a reaffirmation agreement or a redemption.

        "If credit card debt is solely in the name of one spouse, as a practical matter, creditors do not typically have information about the spouse to collect, and in more than 35 years of practicing law, I have never seen a collector sue a spouse who was not on the account. Of course, filing bankruptcy without a spouse does come with complications, so discuss this in detail with whoever you retain to represent you. Hope this perspective helps!",
        "You should probably both file together, especially if you have cosigned on the car and credit cards. You can file by yourself, but you will still have to take your wife's income into account for means test purposes and also the community property to determine if you are over the exemption limit, Also, if you file alone, the creditors will just roll on your wife. Talk with a bankruptcy attorney for more details on how you can both get a fresh start. There are some special reasons why you may wish to file alone, especially if your wife's immigration status is iffy, but gnerally it is much better to file together.",
        "Great question. This involves both state community property law AND bankruptcy law.\n\nIn California, if you are married and do not have a valid prenuptial agreement, to the best of my understanding (which you should confirm with a family law attorney or someone who deals a lot with community law issues) once you are married, the marital community becomes liable for the debts of each spouse.\n\nSo, even if the debts are the separate debt of your wife, your creditors can seek to collect from your community property assets to satisfy that debt. Your community property assets include your wife's income and property unless it is her separate property (brought into the marriage).\n\nThat's what can happen outside of bankruptcy.\n\nIf you file bankruptcy and receive a discharge, your creditors are permanently enjoined from collecting against any of your assets, which includes community property assets which means they cannot collect against any of your wife's community property assets . So as long as you remain married, your bankruptcy discharge will protect your wife from your creditors. In fact, even if she is jointly liable on the debts and she does not file bankruptcy with you, she will be protected by your discharge as long as you are married with the exception that if she has any separate property (e.g. property owned prior to the marriage), then her creditors can pursue that.\n\nWhether she should file bankruptcy with you or not can really only be determined after a comprehensive consultation with an experienced bankruptcy attorney in your state."

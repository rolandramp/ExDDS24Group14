        "As long as you have acted honestly and there are no allegations or proof of fraud in your bankruptcy, it should not affect your license status. Refer to Title 11 of the United States Code, Section 525, which, in its 2010 version provides:\n\n...a governmental unit may not deny, revoke, suspend, or refuse to renew a license, permit, charter, franchise, or other similar grant to, condition such a grant to, discriminate with respect to such a grant against, deny employment to, terminate the employment of, or discriminate with respect to employment against, a person that is or has been a debtor under this title or a bankrupt or a debtor under the Bankruptcy Act, or another person with whom such bankrupt or debtor has been associated, solely because such bankrupt or debtor is or has been a debtor under this title or a bankrupt or debtor under the Bankruptcy Act, has been insolvent before the commencement of the case under this title, or during the case but before the debtor is granted or denied a discharge, or has not paid a debt that is dischargeable in the case under this title or that was discharged under the Bankruptcy Act.",
        "Your license should not be affected by your bankruptcy filing, unless issues of fraud arise in your case. That could affect your license.\n\nAs for filing for bankruptcy, Schedule B provides a specific location to include licenses that professionals own. While the actual value is difficult to determine (OFTEN TIMES ZERO SINCE THE LICENSE IS FOR YOU AND YOU ALONE), it is important to include it as a piece of property in Schedule B.",
        "There are several grounds for which you may be disciplined. Filing bankruptcy is not one of them. So I don't believe your license will be affected if you file for Chapter 7. It will be a stretch to say that filing for bankruptcy amounts to a dishonest conduct.\n\nI am not aware of any rules that require self-reporting of bankruptcy to the DRE. Moreover, it is going to be public record anyway."

    "title": "Credit union will not release car lien",
    "question": "I filed chapter 7 in 2000 but still was able to make payments on my car. All other debts and loans were cleared from the Bankruptsy. After I paid it off , the credit union refused to release the lien . When I called them they said they didn't have to and for all he cared , I could bury the car in my back yard. Now it's been 10 years since I've paid the car off and there still is a lien on it. ?? what can I do?",

        "If you had other debts with the credit union, then those debts are included in the lien. Without a reaffirmation agreement reducing the lien amount OR a redemption, then the lien is not paid off. You would have to reopen the bankruptcy to get the lien released. You may be able to file suit against the credit union arguing that they either need to take the car or release the lien. That has worked in the First Circuit, but no others have ruled on the issue. See a local bankruptcy attorney for help.",
        "If you had a cross collateralization clause and did not pay off those loans, you still owe them money. Hopefully you did not do your bankruptcy pro se. If you had a lawyer your lawyer would have discussed this with you. The only way to fix it now is to pay off the lien. A lawyer might be able to help you negotiate the number but the lender does not have to negotiate.\n\nWhile bankruptcy discharges debts it does NOT erase liens on vehicles.",
        "Is sounds like you had a cross collateral clause attached to your car loan. A cross collateral clause links the collateral from one loan to another loan. Credit unions often use cross collateral clauses to use your car as collateral for a credit card or other loan.\n\nThese agreements often survive a bankruptcy. So even if the credit card is discharged in the bankruptcy, a cross collateral clause will still attach to the vehicle.\n\nSome courts will invalidate these clauses if you can show you were unaware of if. However, you really need to speak to a local attorney about the specific facts of your case to determine how you should proceed.\n\nHope this helps."

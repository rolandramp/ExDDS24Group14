    "title": "Debt Collectors suing me twice!",
    "question": "I was sued by a debt collector in Ohio and got the case dismissed for 11k of credit card debt. I moved to California 6 months ago and a new debt collector in CA has contacted me. I'm presuming I will be summoned soon. Can I get sued for this again. The debt was acquired in CA. Thank you",

        "Yes, if the Ohio case was dismissed without prejudice.",
        "As my colleagues mention above- the key is to determine whether the first case was dismissed with or without prejudice. Note that you should work diligently to get the information- but for an exception, you generaly only have 30 days to respond to a Civil Complaint once your served.",
        "Whether a creditor can successfully sue you for a second time for the same debt will depend on the exact language contained in the order dismissing the case as well as the reason the case was dismissed.\n\nSo get out that court order & look at it. If it says the case is dismissed \"with prejudice,\" this is a defense to any new suit. If it says nothing or says \"without prejudice,\" the creditor is allowed to file a new suit.\n\nHope this perspective helps!",
        "If the first case was dismissed without prejudice, and the statute of limitatons has not expired, yes, you can be sued again. Make sure you file the Answer!"

    "title": "Do I need to pay my ex-spouse's attorney fees if she declared bankruptcy and listed the attorney as one of her creditors?",
    "question": "A judge ordered me to pay $25,000 in attorney fees to my ex-spouse related to our dissolution. Before I could pay it to her, she declared Chapter 7 bankruptcy and listed me as a debtor owing her $25,000. However, she also listed the attorney as a creditor for the $25,000 that she owed to the attorney. She received a complete Chapter 7 discharge (presumably including the attorney fees that she owed.) The trustee did not try to collect the $25,000 from me. So then, even though SHE doesn't owe the attorney fees any more, do I need to pay the $25,000 to the ex-spouse? Can I go back to court to get some sort of order vacating the original order, since she has no attorney fees to pay. (N.B. -- The attorney in question was disbarred about 1 year after the judgment of dissolution. As information.)",
    "answers": [
        "I agree with the prior answers.\n\nThe best course of action is to file a motion in the family court proceeding asking the court to dissolve the attorneys fee award on the basis that your ex has been discharged.\n\nThe argument should be that because the attorneys fees your ex owed have been discharged, she no longer owes any money to the attorney. As the attorney's fees award was against you because the ex owed money as a result of the case, and now no longer does, you should not be compelled to pay a debt to your ex that she no longer owes.\n\nBut be warned - the attorney is likely going to try to fight this and make some kind of claim against you regardless. You should get the motion in front of the family court asap before the attorney can do something else to try to enforce it.\n\nFeedback is important to all of the attorneys on Avvo as it is the only way we know whether our answers were effective in resolving your question.

        "The order to pay the attorney fees are not discharged. You are still on the hook.",
        "A Chapter 7 is not a collector for a particular creditor, and the fact that you owed someone else does not give the Trustee any claim against you anyway, so what the Trustee did or did not do has no relevance whatsoever on the facts you posted. Your issue is between you and the lawyer, not the Trustee or the BR case. In addition, the discharge of a Chapter 7 debtor only discharges that debtor. It does not mean the debt just disappears and often it means the creditor/lawyer is more likely to go after you as the only pocket.",
        "Mr. Modovan is correct that your best course of action is to go back to the court that issued the judgment of divorce and seek relief from the judgment. Its interesting that the Trustee took no action towards the collection of the $25,000.00, likely because he/she associated it with support payable through the judgment. It would be worthwhile to see if the trustee filed a no asset report with the bankruptcy court.",
        "I agree. The court order controls even though she filed for bankruptcy. You may get lucky as more time passes.",
        "Orders from family court regarding payment of attorneys fees don't get paid nearly as often as people might imagine. While it appears that you are legally still responsible for paying these fees, it appears that the collection efforts to force you to do this will be de minimus. So if I guessed, I would say the attorney will probably do little or nothing to attempt to collect from you unless s/he has a great bankruptcy background. Hope this perspective helps!",
        "If the judgment of divorce or any subsequent court order, ordered you to pay the attorney fees to your ex-spouse or her attorney then you are still obligated to do so per that order. Her bankruptcy doesn't change the orders that you have to follow. You can certainly go back to the divorce court and ask for relief from that order given the circumstances you described. Whether the family court judge will relieve you of the obligation is another question. Good Luck!"

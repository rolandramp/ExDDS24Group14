    "title": "I have a defaulted private student loan from Sallie Mae, what can I do to prevent it from growing into Bill Gates net worth?",
    "question": "I took the loan out while going to school online at Westwood College based out of Colorado. I was living in North Carolina and from what I see Sallie Mae is based out of Missouri. The original loan amount was $8,000 and now it is at $18,396.45 APR 9.75% It was disbursed on 12/06/2006. The first payment due date was 05/15/2009. Unsubsidized Last payment received was 12/21/2006. This loan has more than doubled in the past 4 years! I have no idea on how to approach this defaulted loan from Sallie Mae. I have other loans that are in good standing but this one I am stuck on how to handle. It is like a monster.",

        "You might try to do an income contingent repayment plan. I have attached link that gives more info about income contingent repayment. Depending on your circumstances, there may be a way to deal with this debt in bankruptcy, especially if there are things that can be done in Chapter 13. You probably want to talk to a bankruptcy attorney if you consider bankruptcy, however, because student loans are not generally dischargeable in bankruptcy.",
        "I agree with the previous answers. Also keep your good sense of humor about the situation, it will get you a lot further in resolving this matter than being angry at them.\nYour options are to review the different repayment plans. Unfortunately, there is no true debt settlement option for Sallie Mae- they generally want 110+% of the debt in order to negotiate a \"settlement\" so unless that is an option for you then applying for different repayment plans is the way to go.\nThere are some really interesting things happening in Chapter 13 bankruptcy and student loans but for $18k it may be cost prohibitive to do it, however, you should consider consulting with an attorney in your area about it - it may even be a free consultation.\n\nI hope this is useful! Good luck!",

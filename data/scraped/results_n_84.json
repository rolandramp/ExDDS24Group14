    "title": "Options to get my driving privileges back from collection of a judgement ?",
    "question": "My license was suspended for nonpayment of a judgement. I dont have the money for a bankruptcy attorney and I'm not sure if the complaint is void on the face, I might be able to have my reason for not answering the complaint seen as excusable neglect but it has been a long time since the judgement was entered ,2019. I desperately need my license back...is there anything I can do?",
    "answers": [
        "You have to void the judgment to get the license back; bankruptcy would have nothing to do with that, because the state is not trying to collect anything. The \"action\" to suspend the license has already occurred.\n\nYou should try to reach a stipulation with the Plaintiff, so you can pay off an agreed amount, and agree to have the judgment set aside. That should allow you to apply to the state or other authority and get your license back.\n\nGOOD LUCK",
        "An insurance company who sues an individual on a subrogation claim can record the judgment with the Department of Motor Vehicles. License will then be suspended until such time that the judgment is satisfied. Filing a bankruptcy proceeding will allow you to reinstate your license. Consult with a lawyer to represent you. Fees are negotiable.",
        "Not sure what facts you base an allegation that the complaint is void on the face. You can go to the court and that case number and get a copy of the declaration of service.Its simple what to do now. Get case number of civil case. Go to Court. Copy Declaration of Service, complaint, motion for default and default judgment. Look at Declaration of Service to see how you were served. If you disagree with it, for example they say they served you at address you were no longer at, then take to civil law attorney general practitioner to review and get advice BEFORE acting. Why? May the statute of limitations (SOL) is not yet old enough but soon will be for example. Then discuss the next step on whether to call plaintiff and attempt to get an agreed order vacating any judgment vs filing motion to vacate, etc. Discuss with your attorney that SOL if applicable and when. If you own a home that is also really important re whether a judgment lien exists and whether it attaches to your home (in my state it must be recorded with County Tax Recorder to be effective if you live in said homestead). Depending on the validity of the judgment, time could be of essence to act fast too as deadlines exist under the law depending on the type of motion so do this now. Do not ask an out of state attorney on advice on that lawsuit specifically as we are not licensed in that state, only ours, and local rules and state rules also apply to the civil cases. Good luck and thanks for asking here on AVVO.\n\nHowever, if judgment is good, you really need to find the $ to use an attorney and file bankruptcy. In my state the second filed, I fax it to DOL and 3 hrs to 1 day my clients get their license back. That assumes you did NOT have an accident in which you caused death or bodily injury while under the influence of alcohol or drugs too. Good luck."

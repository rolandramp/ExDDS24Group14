        "Yes, it is legal and you have no recourse in this situation. The banks often try to categorize the decision as being due to bankruptcy, but bankruptcy has nothing to do with the bank's own policy to work with its borrowers. Your personal liability to pay back the debt is discharged. You can try to get a loan to refinance from another bank.",
        "Totally legal. You have no recourse. There is no \"right\" to a modification in the first place, and they are certainly under no obligation to refinance a loan that was discharged in bankruptcy.",
        "The banks are taking the position that turning a discharged debt into one that you are liable for would be a violation of the discharge injunction. You can always go to another bank to refinance, or you can request modification under the HAMP program if you are eligible."

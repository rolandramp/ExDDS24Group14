        "Yes and yes. Probably.",
        "I agree with Mr. Waters - it depends on what the judgment was for. A judgment for fraud or an intentional bad act may not be dischargeable.",
        "Yes, you can file bankruptcy after a judgment has been issued. As far as whether the judgment can be discharged or not, it depends on what the judgment is for.\n\nFor example, if it is a family law judgment for support, then no. If it is a money judgment that a credit card company obtained against you, then probably yes, provided there were no allegations, or findings by the court, of fraud or anything else that would make the judgment non-dischargeable, such as a judgment for certain restitution claims, a judgment in an automobile accident action for personal injuries or death where there were drugs or alcohol involved, or any number of other exceptions to discharge.\n\nThe best way to be certain your particular judgment can be discharged is to arrange for a consultation with a local bankrutpcy attorney to review all the facts and circumstances surrounding the judgment, and your other debts you wish to discharge, in order to determine if it would be dischargeable or not. The attorney can also review all of your income and assets to be sure they can all be exempted and protected from creditors and, in general, determine if a bankruptcy is the best option for you and, if so, if a Chapter 7 or a Chapter 13 would be the best.",
        "Attorney Scott Riddle gave you a good answer, to which I'll add that whether bankruptcy itself makes sense for you depends on many other facts in your situation. You should consult with a qualified bankruptcy attorney in your area.",
        "Yes, you can file. Whether it is discharged depends on facts you did not share, such as the nature of the judgment."

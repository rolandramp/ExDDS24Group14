    "question": "I filed an adversary proceeding in Bankruptcy court. The response time has expired, which was 5/26/10. I have proof that I filed the summons and complaint. Question, (1) Does Bankruptcy rule #7055-1 give me the right to motion the court for a default judgement, if I did everything correctly and the defendant did not serve a responsive pleading by that date? (2)What is a completed return of summons? (3) Should I file a declaration or is the complaint enough?",

        "Yes, if the time for answering the complaint has passed, you have the right to file a motion for default judgment. The rules for motions are found in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, beginning with Rule 54a, and should be followed to the letter of the law.",
        "A default motion has to include the notice of motion, your declaration, and a certificate of service. You have to file a certificate of service wwhen you serve the summons and ccomplaint also, that is the completed return of summons.\n\nIf everything was properly served and you can prove that you may be able to get a default, but you have to serve the other party with the motion.",
        "(1) Yes. If you properly served the summons and complaint and the defendant did not file an appearance, you can then file a motion for default judgment.\n(2) A completed return of summons is basically filling out and signing the reverse side of the summons, stating how you served the summons and complaint on the defendant.\n(3) Without knowing what your complaint asks for, I cannot answer this. If you are requesting monetary damages, you will need to file an affidavit of debt, or some sort of sworn declaration. If you are asking for the debt to be declared non-dischargeable, then if the complaint contains sufficient information, you may be able to rely merely on that. After you file your motion for default judgment, you might want to contact the court clerk's office (the judge's courtroom deputy clerk would be the best) to determine whether the papers are in order before the hearing. That way if something else is needed, you may serve and file this before the assigned hearing date."

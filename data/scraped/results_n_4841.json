    "title": "Bank charge off of credit card debt, motion for judgment by collection agency.",
    "question": "If a bank charges off a credit card debt, and sells account to a collection agency, does the collection agency need a written contract between the collection agency and debtor to collect that debt? If the collection agency sues, and moves for summary judgment, is the absence of a written contract between the collection agency and debtor a just cause for dismissal of motion for judgment? Is there a particular case law citation for this?",

        "I handle these cases in Pennsylvania. My fee is very nominal, usually $375 and I return the money if the lawsuit is not dismissed or withdrawn. I have never returned a fee.\nThe reason is very simple, these junk debt buyers who purchase old credit card debt never seem to have the documents to support the claims. The reason they do not have the documents is twofold: either they no longer exist or the debt scavenger chose not to buy them when they bought the debt. Their \"business model\" counts on not needing the documents. When someone is sued they call the company and make arrangements for paying or thinking they have no recourse they do nothing and a judgment by default is entered. In both situations, without the documents, they win. Those who chose to hire counsel have the cases dismissed.\nYou hit upon the first defense. When the junk debt buyer bought the debt--for pennies on the dollar--a $10K debt for maybe a $100--there was a bill of sale. The bill of sale often for hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of debt will refer to an exhibit that purportedly lists the individual accounts purchased. If they have the bill or sale which often they do not--they never seem to have that exhibit--so we may be able to assume they bought debt but there is no evidence they bought your debt. Next this is a breach of contract case and in any breach of contract case they need to produce that contract and/or specify the exact language they are claiming you breached. They never seem to have the one you signed and if they have a contract it is usually just an exemplar of an agreement most of the time from a year different from when you opened your account. Next they claim you owe a certain amount of money but they do not show how they got to that amount by attaching all the account statements. Sometimes they have nothing but an affidavit saying the amount is right--hearsay--and when they do have a statement they usually have the last one or a few more recent ones that do not begin with a $0 balance. The amount they claim is not a provable sum without all the statements--you cannot tell what is penalty, interest, etc.\nBasically these cases can be beaten usually without much effort. The attorney you need is someone who regularly challenges these credit card claims, not a bankruptcy lawyer or a business lawyer unless, again, they are familiar with the defense of these cases. I suggest you to the website for the National Association of Comsumer advocates as search for a lawyer near you.\nI certainly can give you the citation for the case you are asking about but it would be for Pennsylania. If you are familiar with legal research you can use the \"key number\" to find a corresponding CA case. I don't recommend you do this yourself. There are more defenses you can miss. I'll give you the cites in a comment. Also there may be a rule of cvil procedure that says the same--there is one on Pennsylvania.",
        "The entry of a charge off in your credit report has no bearing on the bank selling or assigning your charged off debt to a collection agency. If the collection agency decides to sue you, it will describe itself as the assignee of the bank and there will be a paper trail connecting them. Unless you raised the defense of lack of standing or lack of privity between the collection agency and the bank, you cannot claim that now. Did you do any discovery? Did you ask the collection agency to produce written evidence of them being the assignee of the bank? How much money is involved? If all else fails, you can discharge the debt/judgment in BK.",
        "As explained by other attorneys here, there is no relationship between a \"charge off\" and a debt being \"wiped out.\"\n\nI regularly have clients come in \"madder than a wet hen\" because they are now being sued by a collection agency when the debt was \"charged off.\" I ask them \"have you paid the debt?\" their answer is \"no.\" I tell them \"than you still owe the debt.\"\n\nCharging off a debt merely means that the creditor has told the IRS that they do not think they are going to be able to collect the debt. Based on that they want to take and offset their loss against profits so they don't have to pay taxes on the profits.\n\nIt is extremely common for those debts to be sent out for collection or even sold to \"debt buyers\" who pay cents on the dollar and make money by collecting more than they paid for the debt.\n\nIf the collections agency sues you they can get a judgment for what you owe. As to \"summary judgment\" that has to do with if or how you defend the case.\n\nAt any rate, you should contact a quality bankruptcy attorney. You may need bankruptcy services, then again, you may not. Bankruptcy is only one of several options and a good attorney will tell you so. I know that I have people come in on occasion that think they need a bankruptcy and I show them other options that may be better or advise them not to file at all based on their situation. You do not want someone who is only interested in selling you something rather than finding the best solution for you.\n\nYou should be able to find an experienced attorney by checking the California State Bar website and doing a search for a State Bar Certified Bankruptcy Law Specialist. There is one in Auburn and 7 in Sacramento County.\n\nYou can also search for a bankruptcy attorney with a high avvo rating. Given your location I would check bankruptcy attorney ratings for Roseville, Fair Oaks, Citrus Heights, and Sacramento. Check the attorney's website out and see which ones you would feel comfortable with.\n\nFinally, you can go to a website for the National Association of Consumer Bankruptcy Attorneys. It is NACBA.org.\n\nUse some of all of these tools to find the right attorney. No matter what, get advice from a good bankruptcy attorney immediately.",
        "I agree with my colleague that even if bank charged off a credit card debt and bank can assign its right to collect to a collection agency. You can raise an affirmative defense in your answer that collection agency lacks standing to sue. however, if they provide a copy of the assignment of debt to collection agency, than, it will be entitle to judgment or you can ask for judgment in defendant's favor."

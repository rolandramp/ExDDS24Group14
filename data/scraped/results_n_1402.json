        "Since you asked from San Diego, it seems you're still in San Diego with your two children, and so is he. File here and do it now, so you get court-ordered spousal and child support immediately. There may be questions about personal jurisdiction over your husband, but they are technical and will probably be ignored. HOWEVER, once you file here, and assuming the children have been here for over six months, the court here will have continuing jurisdiction over the children. If you intend to go back to Texas (or some other state) with the children, and you have a family support system there, you should consider going immediately, and hoping that he doesn't file here before the children have been in Texas for six months. If he did, you could be forced to return the children to him, and you may never get back to Texas unless you go alone. if you decide to go to Texas now, be sure to tell him where you are, how you can be reached, and that you are happy to have him come and visit the children - in writing. You do not want to be accused of parental kidnapping. By the way, his command will undoubtedly force him to to pay you some level of child and spousal support once they know you are separated. Check with base legal, but understand that their advice regarding a divorce tends to be a bit lacking - only state courts can divorce people.",

        "Hi, I am a military attorney who left the service and opened my own practice. If you are in San Diego, I am guessing your husband is either in the Navy or the Marines. Both branches have legal assistance attorneys who can help you for free to answer some of your questions as you go through this. It is confidential and your husband will not find out that you went to the legal office.\n\nIn terms of where to file, there are a lot of things to consider. If your home of record is Texas, that means he was located in Texas when he came into the service. So when he moved to California on military orders, his state citizenship did not change. If you were also living with him in Texas, and you were married to him, and you moved to California for the sole purpose of being with him during his service, you are also a Texas citizen still, which means California cannot tax your income or require you to get a new drivers license.\n\nAs a Texas citizen, you can go back to Texas and file for divorce, or you can use California courts. California requires 6 months of residency before you can obtain a divorce, but it is important if you are going to file to file for a legal separation earlier because it creates a break in time. Community assets and debts before that break are community, your assets or debts after that break are personal property, If you have not been here long enough yet, consider the legal separation in the mean time.\n\nIf you do file for a legal separation or divorce here in California, your husband owes you the same duty of support, in fact failing to provide it can be a UCMJ offense. If he is not giving you financial support, you need to contact his first sergeant or commander so they can force him to provide support. Every service is different in defining what constitutes support, so your base legal office would be the great resource to contact there. I come from the Air Force, and we have no definition, which creates mass confusion.\n\nFinally, you may want to consider two options to avoid a costly divorce attorney. First, talk to the legal office about meeting with the family law facilitator in San Diego. He or she will assist you in filling out your forms free of charge, but the family law facilitator is not appropriate for a family with complicated issues like a custody battle. If you are in a position where you and your husband are fighting over custody or some other complication, you can usually find an unbundled attorney who will take a portion of your case for a smaller fee and make only a limited appearance.\n\nI hope that answers your question. As a former legal assistance attorney for the military, I cannot underscore the importance of taking advantage of your free attorneys on base. I wish you the best of luck!",
        "What do you mean by \"home of record in Texas\"? If he is stationed here in CA then in reality his military home is here in CA and if he is sent overseas, then his military base from where he was sent is his military home of record. It would appear that CA is then the proper state that would have jurisdiction over the marriage and your two children. His two children from another relationship won't be relevant to the state that has jurisdiction over your two children and this marriage. I would respectfully disagree with another opinion on that issue. But as long as you have lived here in CA for at least 6 months prior to filing for divorce, you can file here in CA and you also should have established residence in San Diego for 3 months prior to filing.

    "question": "Husband and I are separated he lives in California I live in Washington state. We had a bankruptcy discharge in 2016 both of us were on in and listed in the paperwork is a 2015 Mitsubishi outlander. He got served a suit on dec 27 for the above mentioned car. I explained it was in bk discharge no reaffirmation of debt was made and they said we didn't get the loan on the vehicle until 2016 which i am not sure how it is possible when I drove that car to the lawyer and listed it on the bk. It shows on my paperwork as listed but the company suing is saying it is not included and we need to respond to the suit by 1/27/21 so no default judgement is made on the case they are suing for breach of contract, open book, and account stated for 14557.96$ limited jurisdiction in superior Court of Solano County CA. Need someone to respond to civil suit while I am working on bankruptcy from wa state where it was discharged.",

        "Have you contacted the attorney that represented you in the bankruptcy? Quick work by that attorney may stop the litigation.\nKeep in mind that regardless of the discharge, the creditor is still entitled to possession of the car, but if the debt was discharged, that is all they get. I see you are in Fairfield, so this would be in the Sacramento Division of the Bankruptcy Court if you filed while you lived there. The judges here would not take a violation of the Discharge Order lightly, so if this creditor is suing you for money on a claim that was discharged, your quickest route to relief is the get this back into the bankruptcy court on a sanctions charge.\n\nTalk to your prior attorney and they can advise you!",
        "If the creditor truly was listed in the prior bankruptcy, then you will want to document (I prefer email) that you have notified the creditor of this fact (include a copy of the petition and discharge order for good measure). Any actions they take will give you a cause of action for sanctions in the bankruptcy court (for violation of the automatic stay). Full notice to the creditor of the facts of the prior filing should lead to a dismissal of the lawsuit, but if it doesn't, then you have a choice to hire counsel to defend the pending lawsuit (and make those costs part of your sanctions case), or just seek even more sanctions for any judgment and/or collections they undertake going forward. You will likely need an attorney in the jurisdiction of your original bankruptcy to file the claim for sanctions against the creditor, but if the facts are as clear as you indicate, that should not be too hard. First and foremost is to establish that the creditor was listed in the prior bankruptcy and document that you have notified that creditor of their error in proceeding on collection of the debt. With that in place a good sanctions amount should definitely be obtainable.",
        "Mr. Rausa says it exactly. But were you served up here then? You can put in a notice of appearance if Washington case for example and then they cannot obtain judgment on day 21. Then you might ask for copy of the purchase agreement and include again your statement of exact date filed, which court, case number and chapter and if you have it a copy of the discharge. Then ask them to dismiss the lawsuit if they show contract signed after the filing date and to send you a copy. Include ph # and address. Then you have not spent any attorney fees yet and if that works you are done! A notice of appearance form you can find ..but they simply state you represent yourself and name ph # and address and serve on Creditor's attorney , and if case filed with Court clerk. MAKE sure you include all above in it so that later you can go after both creditor AND the law firm for violating the discharge law if the debt was incurred prepetition. Good luck.",
        "I agree with my colleague. Date of purchase is essential. However, if you are right and they sued you after learning of the bankruptcy or if they continued with the case lawsuit after learning of the bankruptcy, then that is a violation of your discharge. That would be a great case.",
        "More facts are needed to give you useful advice. The fundamental issue pertains to dates: Date of BK; date of purchase of the vehicle; date lender got relief of stay; date of lawsuit, etc. These dates and the supporting documents need to be reviewed by your BK lawyer or another experienced BK lawyer in your area.\n\nFind/consult/hire a lawyer in your area using the Avvo feature \"Find a Lawyer\".

        "The only thing required of you is to attend the Mandatory Settlement Conference. You aren't required to settle and it sounds like you couldn't unless they settled for $0.00. If the case doesn't settle, Plaintiff has the right to proceed with the lawsuit. It doesn't sound like you have an assets that would be subject to collection on a judgment if Plaintiff wins the case. Keep in mind that prior to obtaining a judgment, nothing can be done regarding collecting, including taking your car.\n\nBest of luck to you.",
        "the court will try to reach a resolution in this matter in some fashion. You are obligated to appear for the conference and if not successful the lawsuit will proceed unless the creditor decides to dismiss it based on your lack of assets.",
        "Now would be a good time to speak with a bankruptcy attorney. Most offer free consultations. You sound like you're judgment proof. There may be many good reasons to put off filing bankruptcy for a while and a good attorney can advise you how best to maintain your current status until such time as filing becomes most beneficial.\n\nGood luck!\n\nRob",
        "Consult with a bankruptcy attorney to discharge the credit card debt, before it becomes a serious issue. You may be able to get an inexpensive rate if you go through a legal service, which you can locate by going to the local courthouse and asking for a list of legal services that help people with low income."

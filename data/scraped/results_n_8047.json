    "title": "Tax Effect on Mortgage debt with Non_recourse Loan.",
    "question": "Is there any chance that the lender come after you if you loan is a nonrecourse loan and in bankruptcy before the bank take back the property and still insolvent after. Could the the bank loss when the property is sold constitute a income for me and have to pay tax?",
    "answers": [
        "A non-recourse loan means they cannot sue you if you default (they have no recourse).",
        "By definition, if your loan is non-recourse the lender can only look to the property for repayment in the event of a default on the loan. Also, you cannot have income from debt relief on a non-recourse loan. Therefore, the cancellation of debt on your non-recourse loan will not result in income and you will not have to pay income tax on this amount.",
        "Under the federal Mortgage Debt Forgiveness Tax Relief Act of 2007 (applicable till the end of 2012), you will not need to pay any income tax on canceled debt (which is the unpaid loan balance that is forgiven by lender) resulting from a foreclosure, short sale or deed in lieu of foreclosure if you as the borrower satisfy certain conditions for mortgage tax relief (e.g., principal residence, owned for at least 2 years, debt amount of $2 million or less).\n\nHowever, the Mortgage Debt Forgiveness Tax Relief Act of 2007 does not apply if the property is not a \"principal residence\". IRS Code section 121 defines \"principal residence\" as: \". . . during the 5-year period ending on the date of the sale or exchange, such property has been owned and used by the taxpayer as the taxpayer's principal residence for periods aggregating 2 years or more. \"\n\nForgiveness of a non-recourse loan resulting from a foreclosure or short sale does not result in cancellation of debt income (even if the property is not a principal residence). However, it may result in other tax consequences, for example, if there is reportable gain from the disposition of the home.\n\nFor more information on debt foregiveness, 1099-A, and 1099-C, see:\n\nhttp://www.irs.gov/instructions/i1099ac/ar02.html\n\nhttp://www.irs.gov/newsroom/article/0,,id=174034,00.html\n\nThere is also an IRS Publication 4681:\n\nhttp://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p4681.pdf"

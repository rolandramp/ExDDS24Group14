    "title": "Will a motion to compel filed by a pro per in family court annoy the judge?",
    "question": "In my research I've read that bringing motions to compel in fam court are often viewed as 'contemptible' and 'beneath the judge's concern'. Problem is, the Respondent has refused to provide any financial disclosure, even after I granted their counsel a 2 week extension. Prior to my discovery request, Respondent opened a fraudulent Child Support Case wherein they intentionally lied claiming unemployment and basically zero income. They never responded to CSS's request for income verification either. I have been transparent at every step. Respondent routinely lies on tax filings (self employed) which will be proven upon discovery (hence the reluctance). I'm trying to establish all this on record before the court. Currently the court is completely unawares. Thoughts?",

You, as a party, have a moral responsibility to provide the court with as much as information as possible to make an accurate and effective judgment. If the respondent has made delays a part of his tactics, you should make first an attempt to show that you are cooperating and willing to work with him on this. Still, you should also make it clear that you are not going to wait all year for something that is laid out and set forth by the courts.\n\nI understand that you are doing this on your own, maybe for a lack of financial resources, but do you really want to continue on this road? An attorney would be helpful to provide you with an advocate on your side who can deal with issues like the one above. If he is delaying on disclosing finances, how likely is it that he will be cooperative on a number of other issues connected to the divorce? Can you afford to make semi-informed calls on issues that you do not have any experience with the subject?

        "In Los Angeles and Orange County they will not find it annoying if the opposing party does not provide the records requested. The key is to follow the requires of the California Code of Civil Procedure (CCP). Most judges get mad if the rules for a Motion to Compel are not followed. Some of these rules require filing the request in a timely manner, meeting and conferring with the other side and making sure your original request to the other party was done properly for responses. It would be wise to have a lawyer assist you in concluding as to whether you have met all the requirements.",
        "My experience is that judge's are more annoyed at a party, who fails to comply with discovery, altogether. Based on the circumstances above, I believe the Court will likely grant an order compelling opposing party to provide discovery responses. Whether the Court will issue sanctions, that is another story and unlikely. The family law court usually gives a chance for the other side to comply with a court order without issuing sanctions. However, I would be very thorough in your declaration, stating opposing party's prior failure to respond to CSS's request for income verification. Attach proof of a request and any minute orders or transcripts reflecting his failure to do so previously. Good luck.",
        "It sounds like your ex has not provided you with his preliminary disclosure declarations, namely his Income and Expense Declaration (FL-150) and Schedule of Assets ans Debts (FL-142). Under Family Code sec. 2104(f), your ex must serve you with his completed declarations within 60 days of filing his petition for dissolution or response to the petition, depending on who filed for divorce. If the other side hasn't by your next court date, ask the court for an order directing your ex to serve you with his disclosures. If he doesn't, you can file a contempt motion against him for violating the court's order. If you need to file a motion to compel, go to your local county law library and ask the librarian for a practice guide for instructions on how to draft one. The local law library might also have a sample.\n\nThe only reason why a judge might be annoyed would be if the motion were frivolous/unwarranted.

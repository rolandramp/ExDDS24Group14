    "question": "So, for example, if I have an auto loan with the credit union, but let another vehicle get repossessed (or say I discharge credit card debt with the same bank), can they make me pay it all back before giving me the title to the car I am still paying on? Would it make a difference if I reaffirm or choose to just pay and retain?",

        "A credit card debt is a non-priority unsecured debt. Auto loans that are secured by a lien on the vehicle are secured debts.\n\nBased on your question, let's say you have a credit card debt and 2 auto loans with the same credit union. You file a chapter 7 case and list all three debts. You can choose whether to reaffirm one or both of the auto loans. If you decide to keep (reaffirm) one of the cars, you enter into a new agreement with the credit union, promising to make payments until the agreed-upon amount is paid.\n\nYou can decide not to reaffirm the second auto loan if you do not want the second car. Assuming that there are no problems with your filing and you complete all steps, you will get a discharge of unsecured debts including the credit card debt. The lender whose credit card debt was discharged in the chapter 7 case cannot demand payment for that debt, regardless of the existence of any (reaffirmed) secured debt. To do so would be a violation of the discharge order.\n\nYou should discuss your situation with a bankruptcy attorney before making any decisions. Good luck.",
        "I agree with Stuart. This is very common with credit unions and you will have to review your loan documents to see if the car loan is cross-collateralized with the credit card debt (or other debt).",
        "The answer to your question is found in your loan documents. If the CU granted you an auto loan and then you applied for a credit card there, it is not uncommon for the CU to \"cross-collateralize\" the CC with the auto loan. If you send me copies of your auto loan docs and CC docs I can examine them for you."

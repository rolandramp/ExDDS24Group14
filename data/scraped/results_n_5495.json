    "title": "Chapter 13 discharged , but pre - petition arrears were not cured because no claim was filed .",
    "question": "My chapter 13 was discharged in December 2012 , and I have made all mortgage payments to date but the pre - petition arrears were never addressed because neither BofA or my attorney filed a claim . Bank of America has been in the process of reviewing our loan for a workout since 2011 but has not been able to give us a decision . The trustee kept our case open longer than necessary hoping for a workout but eventually discharged it anyway . Now the collection calls have started again even though they acknowledge it is under review . What can I do to force the issue one way or another ? We have no problem making the mortgage payment , and could even afford more if needed . . I just don't have a lump sum ( 28k ) to cure the arrears .",

If the lender was properly and timely served with the chapter 13 plan, and if the lender did not object to the arrears set forth in the plan by, say, filing a proof of claim and/or a written objection to confirmation, then arguably that lender is bound by the figure set forth in the plan and cannot come after you for the difference.

        "In California, we now gave a law (January 1) that does not allow a mortgage lender to both keep a loan under consideration for a loan mod and continue with a foreclosure. That is called dual tracking and it is no longer legal. That being said, that is only a temporary save for you. There are several questions that need to be answered in your situation, i.e., was your bankruptcy actually discharged or dismissed; how long were you in the bankruptcy. Depending on the answers, you may be able to reopen your bankruptcy to deal with this debt because without the lender (or you through your attorney) filing a claim in the bankruptcy for the arrears, it was NOT dealt with and remains a secured debt. You may have to file a new bankruptcy. But, whatever you have to do, wait until you find out whether you get your loan modification or not. You will need to stay on top of the loan mod process and it wouldn't hurt to consult with a bankruptcy attorney in the meantime to see what your bankruptcy possibilities are, if needed.",

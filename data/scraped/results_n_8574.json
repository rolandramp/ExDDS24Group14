    "title": "Is Bank of America the one that is going to sue me or the creditor",
    "question": "I just got word that bank of america is going to sue me and they are currently trying to serve me. The DF group is the one telling me I could settle or that they could end up garnishing my wages but My husband is unemployed we have a daughter and I am currently pregnant. Would the judge take that into consideration or should I try and file for bankruptcy.",

        "You should first see if you can settle the lawsuit, once you are served.

Evading the process server really does not help you and a judge that learns about this could also simply have the lawsuit published as the form of service.\n\nOn my Avvo profile I have several legal guides, including one on settling a debt collection lawsuit. You should review the tips on my legal guide and then see if you can settle, if they are willing to be reasonable.

I do not know the DF Group, but if they are not lawyers, then they cannot assist you with the litigation, and you should be warned that such company may console you to not worry about it, but then you learn that the debt collection attorney filed a default judgment against you.

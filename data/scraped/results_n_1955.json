    "title": "Chapter 7 bankruptcy. if creditor has judgment and partly for fraud, is that automatically non-dischargeable or must take action",
    "question": "I am just wondering. If a creditor has a judgment against someone (default judgment) and part of it is citing fraud, what happens when the debtor later files chapter 7? Is it automatically not discharged or does the creditor have to actually take some action to have it declared as non dischargeable?",

        "A creditor's holding a default judgment citing fraud does not automatically make a debt non-dischargeable in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy context. The creditor would have to take affirmative action against the Debtor within 60 days from the date of the 341 meeting in the form of an adversary proceeding in order to have the debt deemed non-dischargeable.",
        "More information is needed to give you useful information. Are you the debtor or creditor? Do you hold a default fraud judgment against the debtor or does a creditor have a default fraud judgment against you? As said by my colleagues, whoever is the holder of the default fraud judgment must re-litigate the fraud claim in the BK court by timely filing a complaint to determine the dischargeability of the debt. If no complaint is timely filed, the judgment/debt will be discharged. If the creditor recorded its judgment so that a lien has been placed against property of the debtor, the debtor will want to file a motion in the BK court for an order avoiding the judgment lien if the lien impairs the debtor's homeowners exemption. See a BK atty before doing anything. Many of us offer free consultation/case analysis.",
        "The creditor will have to file an adversary action (the bankruptcy equivalent of a lawsuit) within 60 days after the meeting of creditors if he/she does not want the judgment discharged. IF the judgment was obtained with a litigated hearing (and very few defaults are considered litigated) the court may grant a motion for summary judgment. More than likely, the creditor will need to litigate the issues before the bankruptcy court. A judgment of non-dischargability is not automatic in the case of fraud.",
        "The creditor must file an objection to the discharge in Federal Bankruptcy Court within sixty days after the initial 341(a) hearing.If all you have is a default judgment, it is doubtful that the bankruptcy judge will grant your objection to discharge absent a strong showing of fraud by the debtor.",
        "It is the creditor's responsibility to file an adversary action in the bankruptcy to determine that the debt is nondischargeable. However, I am not comfortable with this level of risk, and often suggest putting one's toes in the water by starting with a Chapter 13 first. Hope this perspective helps!"

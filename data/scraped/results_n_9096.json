    "title": "Can I be sued for a deficiency judgement?",
    "question": "If the trustee files a notice of default in California, my understanding is that the foreclosure will be handled as a non judicial foreclosure and the bank settles for the property and will not be able to pursue me for a deficiency judgement. If they had wanted to pursure a deficiency judgement, they would have had to file suit through a judicial foreclosure process. Is this correct?",

        "Mr. Shirdal is totally right. The main issue is whether the loan is purchase money (and hence non-recourse under CA law), or a subsequent re-fi or HELOC, in which case there is a potential for you to be liable for a deficiency.",
        "The answer to your to question is \"yes, generally, but not always.\" The California non-recourse applies to purchase money loans on a property, not refinances. As such, if you refinanced your property then there is a potential for the lender to attempt to get a deficiency against you (although I have not seen any yet, I presume that I will start seeing more of them). Unfortunately, most of the properties in California fall under this rule. Furthermore, if you have a HELOC (Home Equity Line of Credit) on your property, then you signed a personal guarantee along with your loan documents. A HELOC is like a glorified high limit credit card, except that it is secured by your property. With a HELOC the lender can attempt to collect on the personal guarantee despite the fact that the property is sold (there is some debate whether a purchase money HELOC falls under the same category). Recently, I've seen HELOC lenders seek judgments against their borrowers on properties that have been foreclosed or short sold.\n\nThe only sure-fire way to not be responsible for these debts is to declare bankruptcy. You can declare chapter 7 bankruptcy (if you qualify) and wipe out these personal liabilities and any potential unsecured debt as well.\n\nIf your property has not been foreclosed yet then consider chapter 13 bankruptcy to bring your home current and potentially strip any 2nds or HELOCS.\n\nIf you would like to talk about your bankruptcy options, feel free to contact my office.\n\nDisclaimer: Attorney's response is not intended as legal advice and attorney's response is for informational purposes only. inquirer should seek the advice a duly licensed attorney within that jurisdiction."

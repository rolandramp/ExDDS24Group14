    "question": "I hired a company over the internet to try to collect a stock market lost , which acured because of a broker buying stocks without my authorization. I lost 78,000 thousand dollars. the stock market recovery company said it was 100,000 dollars, which they were wrong and did nothing for a long period of time so i decided to cancel the contract and take it to finra a state regulatory agency. I did not prevail, I was not represented by an attorney and did not know what to do. now 3 years later I have been served by a sister state collection company for 64,000 dollars, how can this be defended and set aside the judgement. I never had a chance to defend myself,for they said the venue was to be heard in New York.",

        "Since you listed this legal issue as a bankruptcy issue, was that a mistake or are you interested in filing BK? If you want to dispose of the matter in the least expensive manner, you should consider discharging the judgment in a BK. Find/consult/hire a lawyer using the Avvo feature \"Find a Lawyer\". Make a list of 4-5 having many 5 star reviews from satisfied clients. If you don't get a prompt call back from one, go on to the next on your list.",
        "It sounds like you were SCAMMED! Why you would use the services of anyone other than a licensed attorney is beyond me. Your chances of being able to set aside a Judgment in NY cannot be ascertained from the minimal facts that you stated. You will probably need a NY licensed Securities attorney which will be very expensive. It would probably be more cost effective to retain an experienced CA Bankruptcy attorney. Consult with both, before you make a decision. To properly answer your questions and address your concerns, the best way to handle this is with an in person consultation with an experienced CA bankruptcy attorney. Use AVVO's Find a Lawyer tool to select a qualified attorney. Good luck. THIS IS NOT LEGAL ADVICE! YOU NEED TO SPEAK TO AN ATTORNEY WHO IS LICENSED IN YOUR STATE FOR LEGAL ADVICE. This is merely suggestions for you to think about in discussing your situation with the local attorney."

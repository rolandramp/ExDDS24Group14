    "question": "What, if any, consequences are there if cash advances were taken out from credit cards at casinos frequently within the year before filing for bankruptcy? Does it matter the intentions were honestly to pay it back and there is payment history supporting that for the past year? Or is it automatically assumed that it was some sort of fraud, esp if unemployed. If waiting for more time to pass before filing is recommended, what is the minimum time passed since last cash advance, is recommended?",

        "A few issues: 1) some courts have held that gambling is a \"luxury good\" such that gambling debts incurred within 60 days of filing raises a presumption that those debts are non-dischargeable (that presumption can be rebutted if you are able to show that you did indeed intend to pay those debts back); 2) in general, getting further into debt with the hope of getting out of debt (\"double or nothing\") is not fraudulent; 3) you probably won't run into any problems, BUT you could.\n\nTalk to an experienced attorney regarding the possibility of an adversary proceeding.",
        "As long as you do not take out cash advances within two months of filing a bankruptcy you should be fine. However, this does not mean a creditor will not challenge the discharge of a debt. It just removes the presumption of fraud label for the cash advances.\n\nWithin the two months, you also should not be paying back any creditors (unless a mortgage or car loan) and using your credit cards.",
        "The rule as to whether a debt may be discharged is set out in 11 USC section 523. While a creditor may file an objection to the discharge, unless there is a presumption in the creditor's favor, the chances of proving intent to repay and whether a debtor acted in good faith come down to only one issue, inferring based on debtor's financial circumstances at the time the debt was made. For example, cash is borrowed that put the debtor's debt at 5% of his annual income, vs cash borrowed that puts the debtor's debt at 50% of his annual income. In the first example, it can be inferred that the debtor could have expected to repay. In the second, while the debtor may have intended to repay, the reality was someone against him. Hope this perspective helps!",
        "If you have cash advances over $1000 during the 60 days before you file, it is presumed to be fraudulent because you should have known you were having difficulty. This means - if a creditor files an objection to discharge - you will have the burden of proving your reasonably intended to pay back the debt. For advances and purchases before 6) days, an objecting creditor has the burden of proving you did not intend to pay the debt back and you have the opportunity to rebut their proof.\nObjections to discharge are costly and creditors only bring objections in cases they think they can win. the older the debt, the less likely the creditor will bring the objection. Large gambling debts can be difficult for consumers to defend. You will need to hire and attorney to defend an objection to discharge based on gambling debts. An experienced attorney can set up your bankruptcy in a way to minimize the risk of creditors objecting to your discharge."

        "You can certainly try to negotiate with your debt collector. I'm confident they will be able to negotiate an amount you will be comfortable paying. however, if your account is in collections already, chances are your credit history is pretty bad at this point. so if you are doing it to save your credit history- it may be too late.\nIf the amount you owe is high, explore your choices with bankruptcy. It may give you a fresh start."

        "One last thought in addition to the excellent advice above. You may be judgment proof after you retire. In other words, there may be no assets or wages that a creditor could collect from. Ask your attorney if this is true in your state. If so, you could consider simply dismissing the 13 and let your creditors shout for their money.\n\nYou can even ask your attorney to write them all letters after your dismissal telling them that you demand that they cease contact with you under pain of penalties per the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. You may get sued after that, but if there are no assets for creditors to take, who cares?\n\nOnce again, this is just one option to consider in addition to those above. Good luck.",
        "You should definitely speak with an attorney because if part of your reason for being in a chapter 13 was to strip off a second mortgage it is in your best interest to see your Chapter 13 to its end.\nYou need an attorney to evaluate your reason for filing the 13 and advise you accordingly.",
        "Why were you in a Chapter 13? If only in a Chapter 13 because you were making \"too much money for Chapter 7\" you may wish to let your Chapter 13 die and refile when your income has been reduced for at least 6 months.\n\nIf you are using your Chapter 13 to pay off secured or priority debts, you may have to tighten your belt & reduce your living expenses in order to pay off these mandatory debts. I would highly recommend that you speak with your own attorney about this issue as he/she will know the facts of your case in much more detail.\n\nHope this perspective helps!",
        "As always, when making major life changes, look at all the options and one of your options is chapter 7 (provided you won't lose your home because you have too much equity or something similar). Sit down with your attorney and map out on paper - what happens if I do this, or something else. Another option is to modify your chapter 13 plan which can be done as a result of 'changed circumstances'. Ask your attorney about these options. You are lucky to have a predictable income."

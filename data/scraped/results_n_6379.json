    "title": "Is it possible to remove/reverse a court judgement on your credit report?",
    "question": "I settled a bad debt by paying creditor on 6/28/11. I have receipt as proof. I updated my address with them at that time. They erred filed a lawsuit against me. I was never served/ notified of lawsuit because they didn't update my address. I found out by receiving a letter from my work of judgement to garnish my wages 8/23/12. I called the creditor and they verified that I did in fact pay and they sent me a letter of acknowledgment of satisfaction of judgement. Since I paid this debt before they even sent it to court, shouldn't this be wiped off my record as false? How can I clear that if even possible? HELP!",

        "The first thing, as Mr. Ridley stated, is that this default judgment must be set aside, then the case dismissed with prejudice. Once that is completed, you can use the court's order setting aside and dismissing the case to get this deleted from your credit reports.\n\nI would act promptly, as there are deadlines for setting aside default judgments, which some judges can be stickers about,. Also, there are time limits to file a claim against the debt collection agency for a bogus lawsuit and attempting to garnish your wages when you were never served, under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, which permits an award of actual damages and attorney's fees. Thus, I would contact a consumer attorney right away, because the deadlines may be coming up soon.\n\nRobert Stempler (please see DISCLAIMER below)\nwww.StopCollectionLawsuits.com\nTwitter: @RStempler",
        "This should be cleared up, as described by my colleague.\nThe creditor's actions appear somewhere between negligence and intentional harm to you.\nIt appears this is one of those situations that should be pursued by you, even if you have to go out of your way to fix it.\nThe identity of the parties may indicate a larger problem.\nFor example, a few months ago, it was determined that Bank of America had been selling accounts to debt buyers after the account debtors had filed bankruptcy, instead of ending collections, and the bankruptcy court levied a major penalty on the bank for such improper conduct.\nYou should contact an experienced debt defense attorney, to review the facts in your case.",
        "Not only should this be off your credit report, they should have set aside the judgment, instead of filing a satisfaction. You can get back in touch with them and request that they set it aside. If they're unwilling to do so, you may have an action under the FCRA or California Rosenthal act for damages and attorney fees for their incorrect collection actions.\n\nEric Ridley offers free FDCPA/FCRA and Rosenthal consultations for California debt collection issues."

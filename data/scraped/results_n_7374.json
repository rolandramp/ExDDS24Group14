        "I have a legal guide on Avvo about wage garnishment that some have found helpful in reducing the amount to make it fair and bearable, which has several tips and useful links. When you fill out the WG-005 \"Employer's Return\" (it's at the links at the end of my legal guide, below) it should be clear from your posting that there is nothing to withhold, as you are not an employee. Wage garnishment is only for an employer to withhold from the employee's wages, similar to tax withholdings. Since you are not paying yourself a paycheck (from your posting) you are not the employer paying wages. If the legal guide is useful at all to you, please mark it thumb up.\n\nRobert Stempler (please see DISCLAIMER below)\nwww.StopCollectionLawsuits.com"

    "title": "If Someone passes the means test in California, but have net disposable income income per month can someone still chapter 7 BK?",
    "question": "If you file chapter 7 and per the means test you qualify: 3 people, makes about 84k and means test is 86k but they had to amend their schedule J, showing they now have $1,250 of net disposable income and filed $47k of unsecured debt, will they likely have to amend their filing to chapter 13? Is there a chance they don’t qualify for either?",
    "answers": [
        "The answer may depend on whether the income has come from certain protected sources such as social security or a VA disability award. Generally, the rule is if you can pay at least 25% of your unsecured debt or at least $10,000 over 3 years, you will not qualify for a discharge in Chapter 7. Hope this perspective helps!",
        "It is possible for someone to not qualify for either chapter 7 bankruptcy or chapter 13 bankruptcy. If there is disposable income available each month then it may be hard for that person to qualify for chapter 7 bankruptcy. If someone has disposable income but amongst other factors it is not enough to payback that persons creditors then it may also not be feasible for them to be in chapter 13 bankruptcy.

        "The court looks not only at the means test which shows past history, but also the I and J to determine if a chapter 13 is the appropriate chapter to file.

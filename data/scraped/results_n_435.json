    "question": "I tried to help a friend. It will be 2 years in July. I have asked many times that they refinance the tuck. The balance owed is 35,660 they keep saying they are working on their credit. But since then brought a used car take many mini trips and eat out a few times a week. I feel I should just file bankruptcy. My credit us very good and excellent. But I am tired of being the one to carry this debt on my crudit√©s",

        "Its a difficult question to answer. If you are not underwater filing a bankruptcy adds grief to your problem.\n\nYour friend should find a way to either return the vehicle to you, or refinance it or pay the balance down somehow. You should not have to be responsible for them forever. I also note best legal advice: don't do business with friends. It ends friendships badly each and every time.\n\nI agree with all the other attorney answers so there is no sense in reinventing the wheel.",
        "Your question falls somewhere between the adages about shooting oneself in the foot and cutting off one's nose to spite one's face.\n\nIf you have a good credit score, it is probably because the payments on the loan you guaranteed are being made on time. Otherwise, late payments on that loan would negatively impact your credit score. So, while your erstwhile friend with his generous dining out habit could probably pay off the loan ahead of schedule, it appears that he is meeting the payment deadlines for now.\n\nEven if you filed bankruptcy, which you should not, there would be no guarantee that the car would be repossessed, as long as the former friend continued to make timely payments. In other words, not only would you be shooting yourself in the foot, but you would be cutting off your nose to spite your face.\n\nI would put it out of mind and seek a better quality of friend.",
        "Bankruptcy is designed to discharge the debts of a person who is UNABLE to repay creditors. It does not exist for the purpose of discharging a debt that a person CAN pay, but doesn't want to pay, because of the circumstances of how the debt was incurred.\n\nYou may want to start by talking to a bankruptcy attorney in your area. Be prepared to discuss your income, assets and all your debts, including the car loan that you co-signed for your friend.",
        "If this is your only debt and the co-signers are making payments on the balance, do not file bankruptcy.",
        "If the friend is making all payments on time and your credit has not been damaged by helping your friend, it wouldn't make sense to intentionally take a step which would hurt your credit.\n\nI understand it would be better for you to have this off your mind but it seems that your friend would not have as good credit terms as being enjoyed; therefore the friend may not be truly motivated, despite what may have been good intentions when this whole thing began.",
        "That is definitely an option. Do you have other debts you could eliminate with a bankruptcy? You will want to make sure your income qualifies you, i.e. that your income passes the Mean's Test. You will also want to make sure you do not own any businesses or other assets that you cannot protect. The bankruptcy will eliminate you liability as to this loan, so whatever ends up being owed, the finance company will not be able to come after you. I recommend speaking to a couple experienced bankruptcy attorneys and hiring one for your bankruptcy filing."

    "title": "I am being sued for 25,000, by an insurance company, for damages in a car accident. I am considering filing bankruptcy.",
    "question": "I am 31 I have no credit, and I don't have any assets. My girlfriend and I just had a baby. I am not employed at the moment. I also have some old medical bills that add up to around $20,000, plus now this. I have been entertaining the idea of filing bankruptcy. Will I qualify for Chapter 7, and how much would I spend to file??",
    "answers": [
        "Since you and your girlfriend are unmarried and you don't have any income \"at the moment\" you would probably qualify for a Chapter 7 bankruptcy. The court does, in some of its calculations take into account how much you have been making over the last six months, so if you just recently became unemployed, you may have to wait to file.\n\nWhether filing is good idea, is another matter entirely. If you have no assets and no regular paycheck, then you may be judgement proof for the time being, meaning there is nothing a creditor could garnish or attach. That being said, however, it might be a good time to file if you are looking for a job and need a fresh start. Usually potential employers see a bankruptcy as less of a blemish than a lot of outstanding debt. Some employers even require employees and potential employees to file. If you are thinking of getting married any time soon, you may want to file now. You would really have to talk to a bankruptcy attorney to determine if filing is right for you, based on all your goals.\n\nHow much would you spend? In lawndale? Bankruptcy is a very specialized area of law and we have seen many attorneys attempt to break into the area of law only to be scared out of court by judges who were angry that the inexperienced attorneys did not know what they were doing. To get a qualified bankruptcy attorney, I would guess that you should spend between $1,000 and $2,000 dollars if it really is a simple Chapter 7. If the attorney charges too little, you can be assured they do not know what they are doing, but in my experience BK attorneys who charge too much are almost as suspect. They charge that much because they accidentally make the case too hard by not preparing properly. The court will also charge a filing fee of $306 (it just went up).\n\nGood luck.",
        "Your first step should be to consult with a reputable bankruptcy attorney in your area who can review your COMPLETE financial situation and advise you whether bankruptcy is a good option for you. There are many factors to consider, and your income is only one of them.",
        "You sound like a good candidate for chapter 7. Since you are not working your income is not an issue for the means test. Fees range but I would say you should expect to pay about $1,500 for an attorney plus a filing fee of $306 to the court. Good luck.",
        "There is no set answer for your situation. I recommend consulting with a bankruptcy attorney in your area. You can find one on AVVO using the find a lawyer tab or the link below.\nIt may be that you are collection proof and filing bankruptcy will not improve your situation. It may also be that you want to do it so that when you are employed this will be all behind you. Talk to an attorney (or more than one) and find out what your rights are. The filing fee is $306 going up in June the attorney fees are negotiated.",
        "From what you say you would qualify for a chapter 7 liquidation as long as the car accident is just a straight car accident and involves no criminal issues that might complicate a BK. The filing fee is $306 and I would say between $1,200 to $1,500 depending on other factors like how many creditors. Many of us offer free consultations, you should check into one to get a real quote.",
        "Call a few experienced bankruptcy attorneys for a consultation (no- charge/free, usually). Many variables to review and consider before deciding to file bankruptcy and selecting the right lawyer will help streamline the process so that you know with confidence what you are doing/deciding.\n\nFrom the sounds of your question, you may be a very good candidate for filing chapter 7 and discharging all of the debt. So long as no alcohol/drugs were related to the auto accident, you should be able to clear out these charges also - the lawsuit will stop as soon as you bankruptcy case is filed (again: get the right lawyer to help you).\n\nFees: chapter 7 filing fee is $306 until June 1 2014 when it increases to $335. Attorney fees vary depending on the complexity of your case and the level of involvement you need/want from your lawyer.\n\nBottom line: make a few calls and plan to spend another 1-2 hours consulting with your lawyer to help make your decision."

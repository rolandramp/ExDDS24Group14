        "I agree with my colleagues who indicated that no new changes have been made regarding discharge of debt after completion of a chapter 13. However, there are a few types of debts which are not discharged as a result of the conclusion of your case and entry of discharge. I urge you to talk with your bankruptcy attorney or seek advice from an experienced bankruptcy attorney in your area to review this issue.",
        "Your question is unclear. You seem to be asking if a creditor can sue you to collect on a debt that has been discharged in bankruptcy. If that is your question, the answer is no. If a creditor that received notice of your discharge attempts to collect a discharged debt from you can sue them for violation of your discharge. Save your evidence of any attempts made, collection letters, vm, etc, and contact an bankruptcy attorney that sues creditors for discharge violations asap.",
        "My colleagues are correct. There hasn't been a significant change in the bankruptcy laws since 2005. There are longstanding rules that prevent creditors whose debts are discharged from trying to collect those debts. Secured debts are not discharged unless they're paid in full, so mortgages and car loans can survive (car loans are usually paid off in a ch13) bankruptcy. If a creditor is attempting to collect a discharged debt you should contact your attorney to file a motion to reopen your bankruptcy then file a motion for the violation of the automatic stay. More details would be helpful so that you can be given better advice.",
        "The last substantial change to bankruptcy discharges was in 2005, so no, there is no new law regarding debts surviving a discharge. If you have any fact-based questions, I suggest you sit down with your chapter 13 attorney to discuss any creditors who are pursuing you after your discharge.",
        "More information is needed to give you useful advice. That said, there are no \"new\" bankruptcy rules/laws. It is possible that what you are describing can be explained if you get specific."

    "title": "Can a lender add \"accrued interest\" to a discharged debt (Ch-7) when the loan is secured by lien that was NOT stripped in banky?",
    "question": "Facts: 2005-took out SBA loan for $150K for my growing business; 2008: business went belly up and I then discharged the debt in Ch-7 banky; Lender put lien on house and made me assign an interest in my life insurance. Result: loan secured two ways! I wish to do a partial settlement in order to have Lender remove lien--which they have now agreed to do. The problem is that they just notified me yesterday that the \"balance owing\" will be the unpaid principal plus \"accrued interest\" at time of pay-out. This means that if I die in 30 years from now the \"accrued interest\" will be almost triple the amount of the unpaid principal balance! Can they do that if I did NOT reaffirm the debt? I really want them to release the lien, however, I can't risk my estate facing such a debt in the future. TY.",

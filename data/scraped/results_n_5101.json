    "question": "I have a writ of execution issued from the small claims court, and social security number/banking branch for my judgment creditor. I'd like to levy her bank account and would like the papers to be served by a process server because the sheriff's department usually takes a couple of months.",

        "Here are the nuts and bolts of a properly executed bank levy (besides being an Attorney, I am a Licensed Private Investigator and a Registered Process Server and I've served many bank levies.)\n\nOpen a file at the proper Sheriff's Court Services Division Office by giving them a copy of the EJ-130 – Writ of Execution and a check for $35.00. The \"proper\" Sheriff's Court Services Division Office is determined by the address of the location being served. The Sheriff's website (http://civil.lasd.org/) has a page for determining this location.\n\nIf you have the Sheriff serve the Levy it will also prepare and serve the associated documents. In the alternative you can hire a Registered Process Server (RPS) to prepare and serve them. A bank levy must be served by the Sheriff or an RPS, a lay person (e.g., your brother-in-law) cannot serve a bank levy.\n\nThe Sheriff or your RPS will prepare and serve: (a) two versions of an EJ-150 – Notice of Levy (one for the Debtor and one for the Garnishee [the bank]); (b) an EJ-152 – Memorandum of Garnishee; and (c) \"Sheriff's Instructions\" with your original signature (RPS only.) As Mr. Jaffe indicated, it is best to have an RPS serve the levy for a number of reasons which I will not go into here.\n\nThe RPS will open the Sheriff’s file with a copy of the EJ-130 – Writ of Execution, the Sheriff’s Instructions (with an original signature), and a check for $35.00.\n\nThe RPS must then serve the bank with a copy of the EJ-130 – Writ of Execution, a copy of the EJ-150 – Notice of Levy (as Garnishee), and a copy of the EJ-152 – Memorandum of Garnishee. NOTE: The EJ-150 – Notice of Levy that is served on the bank MUST be signed by the RPS or the bank will not freeze the funds. The bank will complete the EJ-152 – Memorandum of Garnishee and returns it to the Sheriff within 10 days.\n\nNext, the RPS must mail-serve the debtor with a copy of the EJ-130 – Writ of Execution, a copy of the EJ-150 – Notice of Levy (as Garnishee) that was served on the bank, a copy of the EJ-150 – Notice of Levy (as Debtor), and a copy of a form EJ-155 – Exemptions from the Enforcement of Judgments.\n\nThe RPS must then, within five (5) days of having served the bank, return to the same Sheriff’s Court Services Division Office at which the file was opened and give the Sheriff the original EJ-130 Writ of Execution, and two (2) Proofs of Service – one showing Personal Service on the bank and one showing Service by U.S. Mail on the Debtor.\n\nThe Sheriff will keep the original Writ until it expires. Any further levies based on that Writ must be done through that same Sheriff's office, regardless of where served.\n\nIf all goes according to plan, you should receive the levied funds within six to eight weeks of the date of the levy. You can track the progress of the file through the Sheriff’s website.",
        "First, let me apologize in advance as the LA Superior Court reorganization for Small Claims will/may make your life a bit more difficult.\n\nThat being said, go to the courthouse where your Small Claims case was heard. There WILL BE a local sheriff's department where you can get this taken care of.\n\nPLEASE NOTE, however, that the Sheriff is taking the better part of 3 months (across all of LA County). Therefore, I suggest you contact a commercial process serving company to assist you. If they will not work with you because you are not a lawyer/law firm, contact a collection lawyer or Small Claims lawyer and they can assist you further."

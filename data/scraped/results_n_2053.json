        "The statute of limitations does not re-set. It is \"stayed\" under 11 USC 362 while the BK case is pending, and after the case is dismissed, the creditor can pursue the case.\n\nIf by payment schedule you mean the chapter 13 plan was never confirmed, then no. It makes no difference as to the running of the statute of limitations.",
        "I concur with my colleagues with respect to their analysis of the \"tolling\" of the SoL. The SoL is not \"reset\", but the clock is stopped during the existence of your BK. Upon dismissal of your BK, the clock starts up again where it left off.",
        "There is a provision in the bankruptcy code that specifically states that if the statute of limitations runs during the time period in which your chapter 13 case was active and the automatic stay was in place, then the creditor has 30 days after the case is dismissed and the automatic stay in place to file its actions. If the court follows the statute to the letter, then the creditor only has 30 days to file the case after your case was dismissed under these facts.\n\nOther courts may rule that the statute of limitations picks up where it left off and if the creditor had 3 months to file at the time you filed your case, then the creditor has 3 months after you filed based upon a theory of \"equitable tolling\".",
        "The filing of the bankruptcy tolls the statute of limitations in most situations. When the case is dismissed, the statute of limitations starts to run again, where it left off. The confirmation of a plan is not relevant, it is the filing of the case."

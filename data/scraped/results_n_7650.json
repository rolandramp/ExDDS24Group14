    "question": "If someone has been served with a writ of execution and then they file bankruptcy, does it wipe out the writ against them?",
    "answers": [
        "A writ of execution is basically an order issued by a court giving a judgment creditor the power to satisfy the judgment by levying against the judgment debtor's assets, for example, by garnishing your wages. Once the judgment creditor receives notice that a bankruptcy has been filed, they must cease further action unless they later obtain permission from the bankruptcy court to continue executing on the judgment. They can obtain court permission in situations where the underlying debt is not dischargable, for example, the judgment is for a debt that was incurred by fraud. There are some exceptions to this, for example, a writ of execution pertaining to an eviction judgment (usually called a \"writ of possession\"), or a writ pertaining to a divorce action, such as wage garnishment for back child support. A bankruptcy filing will not prevent a landlord from evicting a tenant if he has already gone through the eviction process and has been awarded the eviction judgment, though in some states the tenant may still have the right to \"cure\" the arrearages and reinstate their tenancy.",
        "If the writ is in aid of executing a judgment for which the underlying debt is dischargable in bankruptcy, then yes, the bankruptcy \"wipes out\" the writ by way of the automatic stay.",
        "A writ of execution is stayed by the bankruptcy, and assuming one receives their discharge in the bankruptcy, enforcing that writ is permanently enjoined. In fact, continuing to collect on that writ after the bankrutpcy is filed subjects the offending creditor to possible monetary sanctions, so he/she would be ill-advised to do that.\n\nOne thing you should keep in mind, and this would really only apply if you owned real estate - if they took that writ and then placed a lien on property you owned, prior to the bankruptcy, then the lien would survive the bankruptcy itself. You would then have to go through a separate process in the bankruptcy court to avoid the lien, which might well be possible, but it is not accomplished simply by filing the bankruptcy - there are other steps. Again, this only applies if prior to bankruptcy they put a judgment lien on the property.\n\nTodd Mannis, Esq.\nCalabasas, California\n\nTel: (818) 591-9890",
        "The writ is \"stayed\" and any attempt to enforce it will be contempt of court. It should be removed by the party who placed it immedeately. Failure to cancel the writ is also a violation of the automatic stay."

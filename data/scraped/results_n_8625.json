    "title": "How far back can an HOA charge a new owner for dues owed by an old owner?",
    "question": "I purchased a property at Foreclosure auction in King County, WA. The old owner owes approx. 2 years in back dues which the HOA has filed a lien for. I contacted the HOA and they state they will not remove the lien until ALL back dues are paid. I need to know how many months they can legally collect for back dues on a property that has been through foreclosure. In many states they can only collect 6 months prior to the Foreclosure and any dues that accrue after the Foreclosure.",

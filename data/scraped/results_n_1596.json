        "If the Landlord has not already started eviction before the bankruptcy and your case is still awaiting discharge, the landlord will need to get permission to commence eviction proceedings by giving the notice to quit - unless some other exceptions apply.",
        "The answer is \"It depends.\" If you were current on your rent when you filed and have fallen in arrears after filing, your landlord can post a 3 day notice. I suspect, given the timing of your question,however that you were in arrears when you filed. Your landlord needs to obtain relief from your automatic stay to pursue legal action relating to pre-petition arrears, but that is fairly easy to get. If they have not, and you have gotten a 3 day notice, you need to direct your landlord's attention to your filing. A large company is much more likely to have missed the noticing paperwork, and not realized you were protected.\nYou should discuss your situation with competent bankruptcy counsel to determine your next step.",
        "Since you are a renter there is no automatic stay. The landlord can evict you as he normally would, however he can not collect anything from you beyond your regular monthly billing if you stay. Many people do not know that a bankruptcy will not stop you from being evicted, however if the landlord does not know that and does not proceed based upon a bankruptcy filing that is not to your detriment.",
        "It sounds like the creditor has not actually done anything to evict you and you are asking if the LL can do it. As stated by my colleagues, any action taken post-petition without first obtaining an order from the BK court judge exposes the landlord to monetary sanctions. You need a BK atty fast. Click the Avvo tab \"Find a Lawyer\". Many of use offer a free consultation by phone and/or email. Take us up on it.",
        "If your landlord is seeking to evict you for rent due prior to the filing of your case, then they are violating the automatic stay if they have not sought and obtained relief from the stay. If you have an attorney you need to discuss this with your attorney. If you do not have one, you would be smart to consult with one. The good thing is that if you have an institutional landlord, rather than an individual, they will be able to pay the sanctions that may be imposed by the court for the violation of the stay.",
        "First, just because the 61st day after your meeting of creditors does not mean that you will receive your discharge on that date, but that is the first day that the court can issue you a discharge.\n\nYou are correct about the automatic stay as to pre-petition debt. However, if you have remained in the home after you filed your case, the rent due for months will not be discharged in your chapter 7. In other words the rent for the months after the filing is considered a post-petition debt. Section 362 of the Bankruptcy Code is an injunction against a creditor from making any attempt to collect a debt that is a pre-petition debt."

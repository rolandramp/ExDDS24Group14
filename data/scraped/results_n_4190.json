    "title": "Is this a scam? What are my rights when dealing with dubious debt collectiors?",
    "question": "I have a received calls from a Tracy Lynn from Check Systems who is threating to sue me in SF County Court for a online payday loan taken out in 5/2011. I have no recollection of this loan and all the contact information aside from my social security # is incorrect. They are claiming that the total cost is $953.22 is owed but are willing to settle for $500.00 Also they claim that if it goes to court it will be the $953.22 plus litigation fees of $2,500. What are my rights? Do I ignore it? I cannot afford the stress nor the financial implications if this is true and I am taken to court. They are refusing to provide me with any type of documentation or proof that this is legitimate. Actually they became pretty hostile and aggressive when I asked for proof.",

        "First, whatever you do, DO NOT give them any information.\n\nIf they don't want to provide you info about the supposed debt, ask to speak to a manager. If that doesn't work, tell them to send you a formal notice in the mail. I tried to look up \"check systems\" and didn't find them on the net. Ask where they are located, what their address is, etc.\n\nHave you gotten a recent copy of your credit report?",
        "I agree with the statement of the other attorneys, in addition I would be concerned whether this organization is even legitimate. You stated that you have no recollection of taking out an internet payday loan, there's a chance that they are completely making up this story and are now attempting to collect an amount of money that you do not owe. There are organizations that exist that attempt to collect money from consumers that do not owe any money. They may be trying to scare and intimidate so that you'll pay them this money.\n\nIn addition to the steps suggested by the previous attorneys, I would search Google and the California Secretary of State website to see whether or not this debt collector is even real. Definitely do not provide them with any additional information and above all don't give them any money. I think they are trying to scare you but don't let them boss you around.\n\nYou should also keep a pen and paper handy and should they contact you again keep notes of what they say. They already appear to be in violation of several debt collection statutes. They shouldn't already have a figure for litigation fees and my guess is that they may not even sue you. So claiming that they will sue you when they might not also violates several debt collection laws.\n\nI recommend that you contact a debt defense or consumer attorney in your area to further assist you. Most of these types of attorneys do not charge an initial consultation fee. To find someone near you either grab someone off of this website or check out naca.net to find a consumer attorney ready to help you.",
        "It isn't possible to know with absolute certainty whether a debt collector is calling on behalf of a legitimate creditor and debt. Sometimes the collection activity is based on an actual debt and the actual creditor that you owe the debt to, but sometimes it is not. The law provides a mechanism to help the consumer. The mechanism is called \"debt validation.\"\n\nOnce you obtain the business address for Tracy Lynn at Check Systems, send a certified letter requesting that she provide you with debt validation pursuant to the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. A creditor must respond in writing with basic information about the debt. (But, at that stage, the creditor does not have to provide all of its documentary evidence showing that it owns the debt.) If the creditor does not respond to your request for debt validation, they may not continue to pursue collection of the debt except to file suit in state court.\n\nIf you are sued for this debt and the creditor wins, it is unlikely that the creditor would be able collect more than twice the amount of the debt in \"litigation fees.\" The cost to file a lawsuit of for that size of claim would be $225.00 or less. Process server fees would be about $65.00 - $75.00. Attorneys fees may not be collectible for this type of debt. So this debt collector may making false or misleading statements (possibly in violation of debt collection statutes).\n\nConsult with a debt collection defense attorney or consumer attorney if you need help with this situation.",
        "Whatever you do, don't ignore it. You have a right to dispute and receive validation of the debt Under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA). Within 30 days of a debt collector first contacting you, you can (and should) send them a letter indicating that you dispute the debt and requesting validation (e.g. a copy of the contract, payment history, and - if a collection agency - proof that the collection agency has the right to collect from you). After receiving your timely request, the debt collector is required to cease all collection efforts until after it provides you with evidence of the debt. If the debt collector continues to try to collect the debt after you've made the request, you may be entitled to file your own lawsuit and seek damages from the debt collector under the FDCPA.\n\nIf you suspect someone fraudulently used your social security number, you might also want to pull your credit report (www.creditkarma.com is truly free) to see if there are other accounts that were opened with your social that are now in collection. You may need to take steps to report this and any other fraudulent activity as a measure to protect yourself.\n\nFinally, depending on how much debt you have, you may consider bankruptcy as an option. Filing for bankruptcy protection would require your creditors to immediately cease all collection efforts and, at the conclusion of the bankruptcy, you can obtain a discharge of this (and other) debts.\n\nIf income is an issue, I suggest you contact a legal aid center in your area to put you in contact with pro bono counsel to help you navigate these issues.

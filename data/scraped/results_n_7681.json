    "question": "I have a defaulted student loan that was referred to a law group. The loan in question is a name I'm not familiar with, maybe the loan was bought buy another company and renamed. The attorney filed a summons, which I answered (no judgement filed). A case management conference was scheduled which I was 15 min late. When I arrived the case was over and I was handed notice for trail setting conference. The attoney's office has been calling me since then. I haven't returned their call yet, due to not knowing what options I may have without getting myself into more trouble. The loan is for 11K, being sued for damages of 13K total amount of 24K. I have been unemployed more than a year, and I'm currently recieving state UI. I would like to resolve this issue, but I'm not sure where to begn",

        "Private student loans are subject to the same defenses as any other consumer loan (statute of limitations, lack of assignment, failure of proof, etc.). You should consult with an attorney who is experienced in defending consumers in debt collection cases. There are several California attorneys on Avvo who are experienced in defending debt collection cases.",
        "The first thing to do is figure out what you can realistically pay given your work situation. If you can get a steady income what I might recommend is a chapter 13 bankruptcy. This allows you to pay a little bit over the next 5 years based on your income and they will not be allowed to collect from you. However, it might be difficult if you only have UI coming in. If I were you I would look at either negotiating a settlement, or filing a chapter 13 in which you have a very low monthly payment ($100 per month or so). Good luck.",
        "you can negotiate a settlement if you have the money or you can fight on closer to trial and see what they are offering.",
        "Never be late to a court hearing, because it is your only chance to be heard. If you were handed a notice for trial setting conference, it sounds like the case has to be set for trial. Now, you have to talk to the law firm to get the trial moving. Student loans are near impossible to get rid of. You will have to deal with this case or risk far worse than just losing."

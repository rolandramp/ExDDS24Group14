    "title": "What do I need to file for bankruptcy? Is it expensive?",
    "question": "I’ve thought about filing for bankruptcy for a while and now that I’ve decided that it might be the best course of action for me. I don’t know how to get started or documents I might need. Also, knowing how much I would have to pay on my first visit if a case is actually opened for me. Any idea? I would be filing for chapter 7.",

        "Generally, filing bankruptcy is not that expensive. Most initial consultations are free. It depends on your trustee as far as what documentation is needed, but generally most require at least a copy of your most recently filed tax returns and 6 months of prior paystubs. It really is best to consult with and hire a bankruptcy attorney so you can complete the process successfully. I hope this helps.",

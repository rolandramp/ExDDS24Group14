    "title": "Chapter 7. Added son on title 2 years ago as 50% owner. He makes payment. If I file bk & have enough exemption will be problem?",
    "question": "Here's what I am asking. I added my son to title of my home 2 years ago. So, technically he is 50% owner. The total equity in the home is $125,000. I am over 65 and on social security. The home is really my only asset I don't even have a car. I know that I can take a $175,000 exemption if I file bankruptcy which would cover ALL of the home's equity whether you look at me as 100% or 50% owner. What I want to know is there anyway they could not allow it or cause me trouble because of transferring 1/2 into my son't name a little over 2 years ago? He lives there and pays the mortgage payment. I know I'll need to hire a lawyer so please don't let that be your advice. I am just really trying to figure out this one detail before deciding to meet with lawyers and look into pursuing this chapter 7. Thank you.",

        "You will be fine if you file bk. You can take up to $175k exemption. The important thing is to disclose that 50% transfer to your son on Statement of Financial Affairs # 18 and on the Gift question. You want to tell the trustee you transferred it to your son for estate planning purposes.\n\nUnder this scenario, you would technically be 50% owner and have 1/2 of the equity $62,500. You can protect up to $175k of this, so you will be fine.",
        "The fact that your exemption covers all of the equity whether you are 100% owner or 50% will be what the trustee looks at. One important question - do you reside in the home as well? You must reside in the home in order to use the homestead exemption. If the equity with you as 100% was over $175k then there would be reason to worry, however, if you reside in the home as well and the equity is under $175k with you as owner, then you should be fine to keep the home in a chapter 7 bankruptcy.",
        "You will have to disclose the transfer and the trustee will make it's own determination as to whether the transfer was actually or constructively fraudulent. I suspect that the exemption will carry the day in your favor.",
        "Hello,\n\nThe trustee could potentially argue fraudulent transfer however there are numerous factors in your favor.\n1. Your son lives there;\n2. He pays the mortgage; and\n3. In addition to the $175,000 exemption, you can also deduct cost of sale which is generally about 8% so the equity is more than protected.\n\nI wish you much success."

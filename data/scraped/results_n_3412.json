    "title": "Can I send a cease and desist letter to debt collector for medical bills?",
    "question": "I know statute of limitations is 4 years from when last payment was made. However the medical bills were incurred in 2004, no payment was made until 2013 when debt collector contacted me. Well past the statute of limitations. Or did I stub myself in the foot since payments have been made??",

        "You can absolutely send a cease and desist letter to the debt collector and they are forbidden to send you any further communications. However, they may still send you documents as they relate to the filing of a law suit. That is assuming they elect to file a lawsuit, if they send you documents saying they intend to file a lawsuit, or that they have filed a law suit but no law suit is filed or they never file the law suit, then there is a violation of debt collection law.\n\nWith regards to a payment restarting the statute of limitations, for the most part I agree with the other attorneys. However, there is some case law out there that does not consider a payment to a debt collector after a breach to reinstate the statute of limitations. Regardless, you should consult with a consumer protection attorney and learn more.",
        "You may send a \"cease and Desist\" letter. This will stop the phone calls. However, they can still file a lawsuit.\n\nAs to your waiving the Statute of Limitations. If you paid, it started again. However, there may be Fair Debt Collection Practices violations in your situation. The FDCPA violations will be re-instate the old SOL, but may give you a cause of action against the collector. You will need to meet with an attorney to review this.",
        "Yes. Making a payment on the debt will restart the clock on the statute. But you might still want to consult an attorney in your area regarding the debt and be sure the there are no violations on their part during the collection."

    "title": "Attorney fees awarded against me, can they really wage garnish me?",
    "question": "Already paying 30% of my net paycheck, via income withholding order, for child support. (X gets check in the mail every week from my employer) Now I have to pay the X's attorney fees, 45k+. I read that child support wage garnishments can be up to 50% but others can only be 25%. So given 30% is already being taken from my weekly paycheck for child support and because attorney fees are not child support, student loans, or taxes and child support takes priority am i correct (read some American Payroll Association Congress 2012 workshop notes) that no more can be taken ? If so what can the creditor take from me? Can the family court do anything?",

        "Yes they really can. I have seen over 100% garnished. You can even repay child support in a Chapter 13 to get some relief and have a budget you can live on but if you just let them garnish they can take everything. .",

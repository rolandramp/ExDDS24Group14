Generally, once you have completed your plan payments, and file the appropriate paperwork with the Court (another important item you need to talk with an attorney about), the Bankruptcy Court will send a discharge notice to all creditors listed in your case.",
        "I agree with my colleagues. It is very important for you to consult with your attorney regarding the closure of your chapter 13 or consult with a new attorney if you do not have an attorney currently. You will need to take some steps in order to get your discharge such as applying for the discharge and completing the financial management course. The creditors listed in your initial paperwork will be served with a copy of your discharge. You mention school loans, however, those are not likely to be discharged along with the rest of your debt and only older tax debt is usually discharged. A full analysis of your plan is necessary to guide you on which debt will be discharged. Hope this helps.",

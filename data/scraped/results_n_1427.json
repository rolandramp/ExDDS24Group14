    "question": "I'm primary on mortgage loan,an uncle co signed loan and filed bankruptcy.

        "Your uncle signed bankruptcy documents under penalty of perjury. He was required to disclose in those documents all assets in which he has any legal or equitable interest.

        "That the mortgage was listed creditor really shouldn't matter, but it is almost certain that your uncle is also on the title, otherwise he couldn't be a co-signer on a Deed of Trust.

If you are the sole owner and there are no transfer issues, there is not reason why you can't sell the property at any time.\n\nGet your title, a copy of your uncle's bankruptcy documents (in particular the Schedules and Statement of Financial Affairs) and go see an experience bankruptcy attorney.

        "There are several issues that have not been addressed in your inquiry. Is your Uncle on title? Does he claim an interest in the property or did he just co-sign on the loan? Was the property listed in Uncle's bankruptcy case? Was Uncle represented by an attorney? Most realtors do not have sufficient accurate knowledge about bankruptcy to be advising their clients about these issues. I urge you to speak with a bankruptcy attorney to assist you.",
        "For your purposes it is more important to know who is on title. Your house is not in your uncle's bankruptcy estate unless he is on title. Your uncle's debt is in his bankruptcy case. He can discharge his liability. If he is not on title his bankruptcy should not interfere with you ability to sell the house.",
        "Consult a bankruptcy attorney about what steps you can take to minimize your loss and see if it's possible to keep the property out of the bankruptcy estate. Not sure what you mean by \"my loan is in bankruptcy.\" Either your loan is in default or it's not. You are the primary borrower and should know whether you're current on your payments.",
        "A Chapter 7 bankruptcy can take as little as 4 months to complete, while a Chapter 13 bankruptcy can take 5 years or more. Realtors shouldn't be giving legal advice, you can sell property while one of the owners is in bankruptcy but you will need court permission. Does uncle still have an ownership interest in the property? Did uncle claim and receive an exemption for any ownership interest he may have. The uncle's interest may belong to the bankruptcy court now. It isn't possible to give accurate answers to questions without a lot more details, More info at the link below"

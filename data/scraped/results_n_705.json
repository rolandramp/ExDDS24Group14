    "title": "My wife was injured and I have a $46,000 bill from an airvac ambulance. What am I liable for",
    "question": "She was injured in a bit of a remote area. The ambulance stopped about half way through the trip and stated they needed assistance from an airvac, It was about 21 miles from the hospital at this point. I received a bill from the airvac for $46,000 for the trip. After a back and forth with the the insurance and airvac company, the insurance reimburse them for about $10,000. After speaking with the airvac, the best they would do is lower the bill to 19,000 after the insurance. I have paid all outstanding bills to hospital , doctor, ambulance etc. I have just received a bill from collection with a $2400 late charge so the bill is about $38,000 dollars right now. What is my responsibility for the airvac. I did not contact them the ambulance did. What are my options other than filling for bankruptcy? Which type of lawyer would be able to best assist me with this? Thank you in advance.",

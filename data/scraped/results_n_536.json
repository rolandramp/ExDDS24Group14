        "The attorney for the creditor should have filed the payment plan with the Court in the form of a stipulated judgment. This lets the court know the parties have resolved the debt and only if you default on the payment plan would it result in a judgment. Make sure the attorney for the creditor did this. If not, I would file an answer and appear in Court to advise the judge of your settlement agreement. At the very least make sure your payment plan/settlement is in writing.",

    "title": "Hi everyone, I got sued for a debt but I'm unemployed.",
    "question": "I couldn't continue making my car payments so I called the finance company to please come and pick up the car. Apparently, they sold the car and the remaining balance is $5000.00 What can they do? Can they garnish my unemployment checks?",
    "answers": [
        "Being unemployed won't stop them from getting a judgment.\n\nI would imagine that your goal is to be employed at some point. If the creditor obtains a judgment, it can then garnish your wages.",
        "You have 30 days in which to decide your best option and implement it, so starting with Avvo was very smart to do today. It would also be wise to consult in the specifics of the facts and documents of your case with an experienced debt collection DEFENSE attorney soon, as each situation calls for its own specific analysis and planning. You are unemployed, a judgment creditor cannot garnish your unemployment check, and unemployment funds are exempt from a levy on your bank account, but banks do make mistakes from day to day, so you still need to exercise more care with money in bank accounts if you allow this collection lawsuit to become a money judgment.\n\nDid you receive a notice of intent to sell the motor vehicle after they took the vehicle and before they sold it at auction? If not, you may have a solid defense to the collection lawsuit and they might not be entitled to a deficiency judgment by law. If you fail to respond to the lawsuit, however, then the court will enter a default judgment against you for the full balance claimed in the debt collection complaint. Please see my legal guide on Avvo, linked below, on the requirements and the consumer's rights following repossession of a vehicle. Please also see my blog on next steps and the short videos on my home page of the website, which also reviews all your options to the lawsuit.\n\nRobert Stempler (please see DISCLAIMER below)\nwww.StopCollectionLawsuits.com\nwww.facebook.com/SoCalConsumerLawyer\nTwitter: @RStempler"

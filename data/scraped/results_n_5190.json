        "Mr. Kaufman's reply is a good review that a late payment can result in repossession, unless there is an actual agreement or understanding between the parties to accept a late payment by a certain due date, without repossessing the vehicle if the payment is timely made. Also, some creditors can arrange to put the upcoming or late payment at the end of the payment schedule, but these typically are confirmed with a written amendment to the installment agreement.\n\nAll contracts include the duty of both parties to act in good faith and deal fairly with the other party. That includes taking extreme actions (such as repossession, which is a costly process and can be very disruptive if this is the borrower's primary operating vehicle), unless the payment is seriously delinquent (more than a few days) or the vehicle's owner has expressed the intent to hide the vehicle or damage it or not insure it, as required by the agreement. There are other reasons, but 90 days late may justify repossession, unless the borrower has something in writing from the lender that permits the payments to be that late.\n\nPlease see my Avvo legal guide on consumer rights in California following repossession, which is linked below. You may want to consult with an experienced consumer attorney to further understand your rights and options to resolve this situation. Is it possible that the reason that you are late on the vehicle payments is that you have too many other debts?\n\nRobert Stempler (please see DISCLAIMER below)\nwww.StopCollectionLawsuits.com\nwww.facebook.com/SoCalConsumerLawyer\nTwitter: @RStempler",
        "I'll assume your car is not late but your payment is. If the payment is more than one minute late, they can usually repossess in CA with no notice required. IF they made some \"mistakes\" by accidnet or on purpose in the contract, you may be able to get ALL of your money returned to you and have them pay your attorney too. I see these mistakes in about 50% of all car sales. Auto fraud offices like mine usually offer a no fee contract review. It may be wise to get in touch with someone like my firm, that handles auto fraud matters for such a free review. It may turn a bad situation into a good one?\n\nhttp://www.CaLemons.com"

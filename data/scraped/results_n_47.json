    "question": "My wife passed away. She did not leave a will. She had 3 profit sharing accounts. I am the beneficiary on 2 of them but the third she did not list any beneficiary. I received a letter from that particular profit sharing account requiring either a Letter of Appointment or a small estate affidavit. Her two profit sharing accounts were over 100k the third that she did not list a beneficiary is under 20k. Would I need to file for a Letter of Appointment or since this particular account is under 20k would a Small Estate Affidavit be okay?",

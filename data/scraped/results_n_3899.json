        "I applaud you for trying to do this yourself, but you are burdening yourself financially, emotionally, and burdening your time and resources by trying to do this without an attorney. Attorney fees are paid from the estate not you, and you are entitled to the same fee as the attorney and guess what - your brother and sister will pay their share of both. To answer your question, yes you can sell assets as long as the probate referee is not going to inventory any of them (they usually don't unless there are valuables such as antiques and collectibles).",
        "Just to reitereate what the other's have said - do not pay the estate's bills from your own pocket. Only the estate should pay your late mother's bills. I know it feels like the right thing to do, but it is not your responsibility to pay those expenses. If there is money in the estate then those creditors can be paid in due course. Their is a process for notice to known creditors. Unknown creditors are covered by the publication requirement. Also, the probate ref will not come in the house. They will do a curbside appraisal. If you want a more thorough appraisal you can hire an independent and use the estate funds. Probably not needed unless one beneficiary is buying another out. Finally, I would not sell any items from the home without all beneficiaries stating their approval in writing. I would give everyone an opportunity to take what they want and then you can sell the rest of the personal property and then have everyone say that they have what they want and approve of an estate sale. I like to do this by way of a group email. It doesn't need to be formal. Then sell the stuff and put the proceeds into the estate bank account.",
        "I will add you should not be paying any of your mothers bills with your own money. You have no legal obligation no matter what the creditors might tell you. The creditors file claims on the estate, if they don't they get no money. No creditors should be paid until you know what the estate has for assets and the claims.. The debts are paid in the priority of. Claims based on the probate code. I fear you are in over your head.I suggest you see an sttorney",
        "The Estate Planner has no legal authority to give to do anything on this while in the Probate process. The Probate referee also has no authority. Only the court can give you authority to sell items but it must be via your Letters of Administration and then you will need to place any proceeds into an estate account that can't be distributed until a final order is given for distribution. You could seek approval from the court to reimburse your for money you have paid from your own funds. I strongly suggest you get the services of a Probate attorney to help. The most difficult task still lie ahead."

    "title": "Unpaid medical bill as a tourist, and future credit score in case of immigration to the USA?",
    "question": "I was in the USA as a tourist while my child got sick and got into the hospital. We had no travel insurance. Got huge bills. The hospital failed to communicate with us about reducing the bill and kept sending final notices.",

        ":Your credit score is already affected, am afraid. It is your responsibility to pursue this and make a deal with the medical providers. They will not run after you. By now they simply have reported you to all 3 major credit reporting companies as a \"dead beat\". While might not affect (or it might) your ability to immigrate to the U.S. should you otherwise qualify, this dispute, unresolved will significantly impair your ability to obtain any type of credit (for years to come!) if and when you finally immigrate.",
        "To my knowledge, the same credit bureaus operate in the US and Canada. Credit report information is not necessarily specific to your Social Security Number (SSN) in the U.S., or the Social Insurance Number (SIN) in Canada. The bureau may report information if sufficient identifying information matches, which may include name, phone number, address, and date of birth. I have not heard whether there is any cross reporting between the bureaus in different countries. As such, the reporting of the medical debt is not necessarily contingent upon the issuance of an SSN.\n\nGiven your circumstances, you may be in a position to negotiate a strong settlement. On the other hand, if the Statute of Limitations runs out, then their ability to collect is severely limited, and you might not pay at all. Neither of these options will necessarily reduce the negative impact of the adverse item to your credit score.\n\nIn the U.S., some accounts can be reported for up to 7 years. If you were to pull your U.S. credit report in a few years, the negative information would continue to appear, if the collector chooses to report it. Keep in mind that the hospital does not have a legal duty to report any collection information. The only way to know if this is an issue for you is to obtain a credit report.",
        "Unless you already have an USA social security number the hospitals and debt collectors really can't report anything to the credit bureaus. But once you receive a SSN and assuming these creditors continuously try to report information to the credit bureaus, then it will appear on your credit report.\nCredit reports and scoring is different between countries.\nBut to answer your question, it should not affect your immigration ability.\nGood luck!",
        "It may affect your residence, you should see if the creditor continues to pursue you.",
        "I am not sure about the credit score, but it is not unheard of when entry or visa becomes a problem in these circumstances."

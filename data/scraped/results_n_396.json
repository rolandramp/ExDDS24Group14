        "May I suggest taking all your money out of that bank and open up a new bank account at another bank. Yes they can garnish your wages and levy your bank account.\n\nYou may also want to address the judgement itself. Contact a local attorney for assistance",
        "Yes, if a creditor has a judgment against you then they may collect from you multiple ways including a wage garnishment, bank levy, and/or recording a lien on any real property you own. I would deal with this judgment as soon as possible. If this is your only debt, and depending on the amount, you may want to reach out to the creditor to see if you can settle the judgment. If you want to eliminate it, and other debt you have, chapter 7 may be a good idea, assuming you otherwise qualify. In the short term, do not put any more money in the bank account the creditor levied. I recommend speaking with some experienced bankruptcy attorneys regarding your options.",
        "If the collection agency has a judgment against you, then both collection methods are available to them. Might be time to meet with a bankruptcy lawyer.",
        "The best way to handle this situation is to retain an experienced CA Bankruptcy attorney, so that your problems can be eliminated. Use AVVO's Find a Lawyer tool to select a qualified attorney. Good luck. THIS IS NOT LEGAL ADVICE! YOU NEED TO SPEAK TO AN ATTORNEY WHO IS LICENSED IN YOUR STATE FOR LEGAL ADVICE. This is merely suggestions for you to think about in discussing your situation with the local attorney."

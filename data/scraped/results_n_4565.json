    "title": "Do I have to provide my bank statements or can I provide something else in lieu of them?",
    "question": "My boyfriend is filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. We live together, have a child together, and live on his income alone. I am unemployed and have been for a long time. At his request I have been moving the money to my account to pay our bills. He has been using and paying on my car as well as using my credit cards. His attorney is asking for my bank statements because of the transfer of his wages to my account. I am not inclined to provide them as I don't want anything to do with this bankruptcy since all these debts were by far delinquent and defaulted before he met me. Is there some way to get out of providing my personal bank account information?",

        "You wrote, “At [My boyfriend] request I have been moving the money to my account to pay our bills.\nA: I'm uncertain, but this leads me to the impression the money is first landing in his account and then being transferred over to yours for payment of the bills.\nIf the money was being directly deposited into your account, I would tend to agree with attorney Bunce, nevertheless, I might just stick my heels in and provide the bank statements, (account numbers redacted), if trustee presses on the issue.",
        "Since you are not married, and have no income, I think the attorney is simply trying to blunt any possible claim by the trustee that you are contributing to the \"family\" income in some way. I would ask the attorney specifically why he wants to see your bank records. If you don't get a clear answer, get a different BK atty.",
        "Sure, you don't have to provide your bank account records, you can let the US Justice Department obtain them by a subpoena directed to your bank! Hope this perspective helps!"

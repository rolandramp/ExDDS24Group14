    "question": "Im going to file chapter 7 and put my old debt behind me. However, I just opened a merchant account (a month before) because I want to sell food items from my uncles stand to begin making a lving doing something new. I have not opened the business yet. I have not idea if it will work out at this point. Since ive never used the merchant account do i have to list it on my BK forms? and...if i do list it, would they notify the holder of my merchant account, even if its never been used?",

        "You should err on the side of full disclosure and list them. However, you can absolutely contact them outside of the bankruptcy and request that they keep the account open. Since there was no debt of theirs to discharge, and you cannot file a bankruptcy again in the near future, you may be able to convince them to allow you to keep the account open.\nGood luck!",
        "Yes, list the merchant account (as well as any & all other open accounts regardless of any dollar amount or zero balance).\n\nFor any assets/accounts not listed in a bankruptcy petition, a current or future creditor could potentially argue that those assets were not exempted from the reach of the chapter 7 trustee, and so could be within the reach of a creditor claim, now... or possibly in the future.\n\nIn 99.99% of bankruptcy cases (read as \"100%\"), the cardinal rule in filing bankruptcy is \"disclose disclose disclose\".\n\nFor more information visit: www.salanicklaw.com\n\nBest of luck!",
        "I would err on the side of disclosure and list it as an asset with no value. It is not a debt, so the bank would not need to be advised of your bankruptcy, although they may find out about your bankruptcy anyway by other means.\n\nHope this perspective helps!"

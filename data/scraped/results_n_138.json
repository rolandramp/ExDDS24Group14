    "title": "Chapter 7 Adversary & Violation of Automatic Stay",
    "question": "Hi, I filed an application to set aside a default judgment in another jurisdiction before I filed my Chapter 7. A creditor filed an adversary which I am in now. The same creditor that filed the adversary responded to my application to set aside their default and also participated in the hearing to set aside the default. The bankruptcy judge became aware of the creditor's participation in efforts to enforce this debt by participating in the hearing and asked the creditor to show cause on why they should not be held in contempt for violating the automatic stay. The creditor has just filed their response and blaming me, a pro se litigant for making them violate the automatic stay. I have not bothered to read the case law yet they reference but could they have a valid argument or not? Credit never filed a motion to lift the stay, they responded to my application, actually took information from the adversary deposition, and used it at my hearing to set aside the default judgment. So my follow up question is, did they violate the automatic stay or not for participating in this pre-petition debt litigation.",

        "Bottom line. You need a lawyer. The reality is they responded to something you filed in state court. Even if their response filing is per se a violation of the automatic stay (which would require legal research and analysis and is not black and white), the question is so what? what does it do for you? and none of us can answer that without knowing what the judgment is for and what the adversary is about and who the judge presiding is and what the creditor's track record with debt collection is.",
        "This is the time to search high and low for a lawyer. The stay violation could be your \"get out of jail\" card. You could nail the creditor for attorney's fees and get their debt wiped out. If they used info. form the adversary in the state court case, that is a clear showing of knowledge of the bankruptcy. Now if the creditor is also pro se, the judge may go easier on them. You will need a lawyer to be successful.",
        "So, as I understand it, there was a state court default judgment issued; you filed a Motion to Vacate the Default Judgment in state court, **prior** to commencing your current Chapter 7 case. The creditor then filed an objection to your Motion in state court and participated in the hearing objecting to the allowance of your Motion in state court. The bankruptcy court judge (who is hearing the adversary proceeding that was commenced by the same creditor) became aware of the fact that there was a hearing on the motion to vacate the default judgment in which the creditor opposed your Motion. The bankruptcy court judge then issued an order to show cause why the creditor should not be held in contempt for violating the automatic stay and the creditor's argument in response is that they were effectively \"forced\" to violate the automatic stay (presumably because you filed the Motion to vacate default followed by filing a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition).\n\nTo the extent that I am correctly interpreting the set of facts that you have suppressed, the excuse given by the creditor simply does not hold water. The creditor did not have to file an Objection to your Motion or participate at the hearing, once you filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition and they became aware of it.\n\nThis then begs the question: \"what should they have done?\" And the answer is quite simple: what they should have done was to file a \"Suggestion of Bankruptcy and Notice of Stay\", notifying the State Court and the state court judge that under 11 U.S.C. Section 362(a), **all** proceedings regarding your Motion to Vacate Default and any hearing thereon were \"automatically stayed\" as a matter of Federal law. This would have had the effect of \"freezing in the place\" the state court matter at the precise point in time of the BK filing without violating the automatic stay, and thereby preserving whatever rights they had upon obtaining relief from the automatic stay once that motion was filed in the bankruptcy case.\n\nIt should be quite interesting to hear what the bankruptcy judge makes of this \"interesting\" defense. I believe however that you REALLY SHOULD hire an experienced bankruptcy attorney to represent you in the case and adversary proceeding. However, I for one, based upon this set of facts, believe that such an argument will not avail the creditor involved. Best regards! I remain . . .\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nAttorney Richard N. Gottlieb"

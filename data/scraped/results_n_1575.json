    "question": "Trying to finish a \"True Default\" divorce as the Petitioner. Spouse took what he wanted before abandoning family over 5 years ago. Spouse never responded to summons and don't know his whereabouts. He has not communicated with kids or me in over 5 years. May I check the box stating \"There are no assets or debts to be disposed of by the Court\" or must I check the box about proposed community property division even though we had verbal agreement before he took off that I could assume remaining assets and debts as long as I don't ask for spousal or child support, which i am not doing. Unfortunately, he didn't stick around long enough for us to have drawn up a written agreement. I am worried about the court awarding him 50% of assets I built up since he left.",

        "Don't check the box where you state there are no assets to be disposed of. Always leave open the possibility that the court may need to enter judgment on division of property and assets and liabilities. You really need help from a family law attorney to protect your rights.",
        "You are asking the court to confirm community property to you, so I believe you do need to check 4.a.(3)(B). Your problem, though, is that then you need to show that the assets and debts will be evenly divided. I think it's well worth your time to obtain a consultation for this stage of the proceeding.",
        "Yes, you can check that box. Nothing you have acquired since the separation is community property to be divided."

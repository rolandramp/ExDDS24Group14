    "title": "I am being sued by a debt collections company in California that bought my $3000.00 debt from Wells Fargo.",
    "question": "I am being sued by a debt collections company in California that bought my $3000.00 3 year old debt from Wells Fargo. I never fought it because I was told I would not win either way. My question is if they get a default judgement against me what can they do if I have NO assets? Will they try to go after my bank accounts or will they just give up??? Also I was told that the debt would last for ten years BUT than the debt agency could renew the debt and go after me for another 10 years. Is that correct? Thank you!",

        "I agree with the majority and file this concurrence (LOL) to distinguish two concepts. First, someone apparently purchased a claim/debt that was not time-barred and, because you are not resisting, will obtain a default and then prove up a default judgment. If there is no opposition, and if your original contract provided for a prevailing party fee award, you should expect the judgment to include some award of attorneys' fees-- generally in accordance with schedules under local rules for fee awards in uncontested cases.\n\nThe judgment is something different from what was previously a contract-based claim. It is this judgment that has a basic \"life\" of 10 years in California. As noted, however, the judgment can be renewed prior to its expiration.\n\nYou say you have no assets, but then speak of bank accounts. Judgment creditors can levy on accounts. And, as others noted, if you are a wage earner someone may garnish your wages through an Earnings Withholding Order. If attorneys' fees are in the judgment, you should be concerned about attempts to recover fees for time spent seeking to enforce the judgment.\n\nSomeone chose to pursue you over a $ 3000 debt. They have economies of scale in dealing with people in your position. They have power. I strongly agree with the attorney suggesting you negotiate for a discount or payment plan. The collector's major fear will be a bankruptcy. Consider having a bankruptcy attorney do the negotiation.",
        "Agree with other counsel and it's 10 years and can be renewed every ten years adding interest to the debt. If your only source of income is social security, this kind of income is exempt, in other words creditors can't take it, and if the only source of money in bank account comes from social security then the funds in the bank account(s) would be exempt. The other alternative is to contact creditor's attorney and offer a payment plan or a settlement. You can PROBABLY settle this for $1,500 or less.",
        "If the creditor obtains a default judgment against you, it is up to the creditor to enforce the judgment. Nothing is automatic. There are various methods to enforce a money judgment such as garnishing wages, levying bank accounts, and liening real property. The judgment creditor can also take your debtor's examination every 120 days to make your life miserable.\n\nYes, the judgment is valid for 10 years, and renewable for another 10 years.\n\nKeep in mind that the judgment accrues interest at 10% per annum (simple not compounded interest)\\, so after 10 or 20 years, the amount you owe will increase significantly.",

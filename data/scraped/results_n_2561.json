    "title": "Judgment against an individual who is a sole shareholder of a corporation.",
    "question": "I am a sole shareholder/owner of a corporation. I have a judgment against me individually. Can creditors come after my corporation? I believe they cannot touch corporate assets. But can they take away the stock I own of the corporation, liquidate it and take it?",
    "question_tags": "Liquidating business assets,Bankruptcy,Debt,Debt settlement,Bankruptcy liquidation,Bankruptcy and debt,Business",
    "answers": [
        "Yes. Judgment creditor may seize stock, liquidate, take other actions to collect the debt. Under certain circumstances, judgment creditor may pierce corporate veil and enforce directly against corporate assets..",
        "Yes, certainly they can. A judgment creditor of a debtor-shareholder may attach the shares of the debtor's stock to gain all the rights that the debtor had in the corporation, including rights to transfer the shares, the right to vote on corporate matters, the right to view books and records, and rights to bring derivative actions against the corporate officers and directors. If the debtor-shareholder's interest is sufficiently significant, a judgment creditor may also cause the liquidation of the corporation and obtain access to its assets.",
        "It also matters if you personally guaranteed the debt.\n\nI have changed this to debt settlement.",
        "Yes, a creditor could seek to have your shares of stock seized and sold.",
        "You have it generally correct. However, if the creditor can prove that the corporation is your alter ego, then they can attack the assets of the corporation. This is very fact specific and involves learning if you and the corporation commingled funds, paid the others debts, acted in concert in any significant way, and many other factors.\n\nIf they are trying to attack corporate assets, you and/or the corporation should hire an attorney to fight it."

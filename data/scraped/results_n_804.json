    "title": "Can a Personal Injury Judgment be discharged in Bankruptcy?",
    "question": "My friend has a Personal Injury Judgment against him from almost 20 years ago. It was renewed once, in 2008, and I'm sure it will be renewed again. My friend has not paid anything on the Judgment, and it has grown to about $12 million dollars. Can he discharge this debt through a bankruptcy?",
    "question_tags": "DUI,Bankruptcy,Debt,Debt discharge,Bankruptcy and debt",
    "answers": [
        "Based on your comment on attorney Pont's answer, it doesn't appear to be a dischargeable debt. See 11 USC 523(a)(9), which states that a bankruptcy filing does not discharge an individual debtor from any debt \"for death or personal injury caused by the debtor’s operation of a motor vehicle, vessel, or aircraft if such operation was unlawful because the debtor was intoxicated from using alcohol, a drug, or another substance.\"",
        "As long as it was not a DUI or an intentional act, yes he can discharge it in a Chapter 7, if he qualifies for that.",
        "Was alcohol involved> He should consult a bankruptcy attorney who can review the specifics of the situation.",
        "Perhaps unless there are allegations suggesting non-dischargeability. See 11 USC§523 for a list of the exceptions to discharge. Contact a lawyer for a free consultation.",
        "Likely so unless there are allegations involving an intentional tort. I will re-post this to bankruptcy and defer to the answers given by those who practice in that field."

    "title": "What happens if you do not pay court ordered child care expenses and alimony?",
    "question": "Ex is self employed. He has stopped paying his alimony and his half of court ordered child care. He is currently on probation for not paying his child support- the result of a DCSS hearing. What are my options in getting this enforced? He claims to only earn $2500 a month, but drives a brand new luxury sports car and has two rented residences (Sacramento and Los Angeles). He lives very well and clearly has income. He puts everything in his girlfriends name (she is unemployed) and he has nothing to lien that I am aware of.",

        "A court order for payment of money (whether spousal support, child support, or otherwise) is enforceable in a number of ways. If you know where your ex does his banking, you could levy on his account(s) by filing a Writ of Execution and causing it to be served on the bank. You could also notice a judgment debtor examination. The order may also be enforceable in contempt, though this is usually a remedy of last resort. Enforcement of judgments is time-consuming and tedious. I suggest you review the information on this website: http://www.courtinfo.ca.gov/selfhelp/family/enforcement/csps/nopay.htm.",
        "Spousal and child support arrearages carry substantial interest and can be enforced indefinitely. They cannot be discharged in bankruptcy. If you have evidence that he could pay these debts, and could meet his support obligations on a on-going basis, you can file for an OSC or even a proceeding for contempt. In response he will probably petition the court to reduce his support obligation to conform to the Guideline amount for his newly reduced income. It can be expensive to muster the kind of evidence that will suffice in court to reveal that his inability to pay is purposeful and deceptive. If you expect that this is the way he intends to proceed hereafter, as opposed to a temporary financial difficulty, it will in the long-run serve you to seek out the advice and assistance of a qualified family law practitioner who has extensive experience in the local court where your case is handled."

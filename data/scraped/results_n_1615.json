    "question": "Can you hire an attorney after you file pro se before the meeting of creditors?",
    "answers": [
        "You can hire an attorney at any point in the process, however, if hired after the case is filed most will want to be paid on an hourly basis and if there are problems created by doing the filing yourself, it can be more expensive to pay an attorney to fix it than it would have been to hire an attorney for a flat fee to do it right.",
        "Yes, you may. The law doesn't require that one who acted pro se must remain so. If for one reason or another you decide to hire an attorney after your petition has already been filed, you may certainly do so. Some trustees I've appeared before will not even allow an attorney to make a special appearance at the 341 meeting just for purposes of accompanying the debtor to the 341. Any attorney appearing in the case will be required to formally and officially enter his appearance with the court for the debtor.",
        "Yes. You'll just need to shop around as many attorneys will not want to take on a case that's already been filed. However, it will be worth it - as long as you hire an experienced attorney and ideally someone who has taken on a case from a pro se filer. I've done it and there was no problem. I just had to get up to speed on the case fast - before the 341 hearing. Filing pro se is difficult and many people who file their case see their case get dismissed. Having an attorney will typically avoid that problem. Good luck.",
        "You can hire an attorney at any point in the process. Many people find that many of the documents filed with the court pro se were done incorrectly or are substantially incomplete.\n\nMany attorneys will not take a case at this point. Once you file under chapter 7, you normally are not able to dismiss the case. So, if you had undisclosed assets, your Statement of Financial Affairs didn't disclose transfers or answer other questions in that document incorrectly or your Means Test was incorrect, you might be headed for trouble. Chapter 7 bankruptcy is a serious step and there are risks that most people just don't realize exist. Having an experienced bankruptcy attorney is the only way to do this right in most cases.\n\nYour case may be just fine as it is, or it may need substantial amendments. There may or may not be other issues that the trustee might bring up. Get that attorney now. I doubt that you will save much money in fees by having filed without an attorney in the first place. Even for a simple case, I can't ever recommend that someone \"go it alone\" without legal help.",
        "Yes. Once you hire an attorney, they will be required to file a \"Substitution of Attorney\" with the court. This is a form that allows the lawyer to become the attorney of record on your case. In most case, the attorney will then file an Amendment to correct any deficiencies, add creditors that may have been left off, fix the income and expense statements, correct or adjust the Means Test, etc. All information on the bankruptcy documents must be complete, accurate and truthful.",
        "You can, and the sooner the better to give the attorney time to review your case and make any necessary changes to the petition. Answer the attorney's questions truthfully and completely so that she or he can give you the best advice possible..",
        "Yes, but be aware that you must answer all of the attorneys questions truthfully. As my colleagues above point out, many attorneys are reluctant to get involved because if you now feel you need an attorney, there may be a problem, or you may have left out critical information. Contact an experienced attorney, even if you need to pay him/her to review what you have done to date. The earlier it is done, the better for your case.",
        "You can try, but many attorneys will not want to appear responsible for the work you prepared and may 1) turn you down, at any cost, 2) require that the entire petition be redone. Hope this perspective helps!",
        "Sure you can, but many attorneys will be reluctant to get involved at this point.",
        "The short answer is a definite yes. The longer answer is that if you're thinking about doing that, sooner is better than later. The attorney will need time to fully review your filing and discuss it with you, probably including asking you many questions."

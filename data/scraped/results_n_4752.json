    "question": "Recently, I was sued in small claims court for a thousand dollars. I lost and am ordered to pay but I don't have a thousand dollars. I only have 100 dollars to my name and a job pending that will only pay 80 to 100 per week. Do I still have to pay when I don't have any money?",

        "A Small Claims Court judgment is a civil judgment. It is not a court order that you pay the money. You cannot be arrested for not paying a civil judgment. What the creditor can do is to garnish up to 25% of your wages, less if you need the money for \"necessities of life\" such as rent, utilities, food, clothing, etc. Many types of property are exempt from execution. See Code of Civil Procedure sections 703 and 704. If you own a home, $75,000 of equity is automatically exempt, more if you have a family, are disabled or are a senior. However, if you have a large amount of money in the bank, own resort property, a private airplane, or other non-exempt property, the creditor can, with a Writ, levy upon such property without prior notice to you.",
        "If you are being paid only $80 to $100 per week, then the short answer is \"no\" for the time being until your income increases. Garnishment is based on 25% of the debtor's disposable income."

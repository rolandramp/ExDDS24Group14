    "title": "Does a phone conversation restart the statute of limitations in California?",
    "question": "I was served for a debt lawsuit for credit card debt I accrued beginning in 2004. My last payment was around 2006. It is now 2013. I do recall having a phone conversation about this with the collection agency but not sure of the date. Does this verbal acknowledgment restart the statute of limitations for collection if it was in the last 4 years? Or is it only a written promise to pay or partial payment that restarts the clock?",
    "answers": [
        "Do not believe anything that a debt collector tells you, especially if it is legal advise.\n\nIt may be a violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act for a debt collector to attempt to collect a time-barred debt. And it is a violation for a debt collector to make any misleading or false statement in connection with the attempt to collect a debt. If there is a violation of the FDCPA, you can recover a statutory penalty of up to $1,000 per violation (plyu, maybe an additional $1,000 for violation of the California RFDCPA), for each violation, plus any damages, compensation for emotional distress, attorney's fees and court costs.\n\nYou should consult an attorney who handles FDCPA cases. Also, if you are representing yourself in a collection lawsuit, you should get an attorney. If the underlying statute includes an attorney's fees clause, and if you win, you attorney may be able to collect his/her fees from the debt collector. You should, at the least, meet with an attorney.",
        "No.",
        "Absolutely not! You must have made a payment. Acknowledgment of the debt or promise to pay does not affect the SOL.",
        "you need to make a payment or charge there has to be a transaction not a telephone call"

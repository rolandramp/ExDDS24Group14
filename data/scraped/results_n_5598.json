        "This is really a matter of state property law. If the ring is truly her separate property, then it does not need to be listed in a bankruptcy case not filed by her. Getting married does not automatically turn separate property into community property, it must be \"transmuted\" for that to occur. Whether getting married transmutes the character of a ring given in promise of marriage into community property, I really don't know.\n\nThe other posts are correct, however, that you do need to list all of her debts, even ones she had from prior to the marriage, because they are now all \"community debts\" which is really a term of art limited to bankruptcy proceedings.\n\nAs Mr. Waters pointed out, unless the ring is of really high value, it's probably safest to list it and exempt it, but you really need to consult with an experienced bankruptcy attorney--and probably a family law attorney--to make sure you present everything correctly, properly and--to the extent possible--in the light most favorable to you.\n\nMark Markus has been practicing exclusively bankruptcy law in California since 1991.

        "From what you described, I'd say the ring is your wife's separate property since you gave it to her before you two were married.

        "If it is valuable enough, absolutely. When a married person files a solo bankruptcy petition, the FIRST thing the trustee asks is whether your spouse has any assets that you didn't list as owning in your bankruptcy petition. There is no trustee around that won't, if the asset is valuable enough, go after it even if you claim that YOU don't own it because it belongs to your spouse. That's a dodge that lots of people have tried to shield assets from the bankruptcy court. It won't work, and if you don't list the assets on your petition, you can bet the trustee will claim fraud. There may be some exemption money available to shield the ring, so speak with a bankruptcy attorney ASAP.",
        "No, unless the ring is of extraordinarily high value. Even if you file BK individually, all of your wife's assets would need to be listed and exempted as well in Schedule B of your petition. However, your are allowed to exempt assets on Schedule C. Under the \"703\" series of exemptions, you can exempt jewelry with a value up to $1,425.00, but you also have a \"wildcard\" exemption available of $25,340. Under the \"704\" series of exemptions, the exemption would be $7,175.00. Keep in mind also, that the \"value\" that is to be listed is not the purchase price, or the replacement cost, but rather the current fair market value of the used ring.\n\nKnowing how to value assets and how to properly exempt them is one of the things a good bankruptcy attorney would be able to do for you. I would suggest arranging for a consultation with a local bankruptcy attorney to review your entire financial situation, your income and expenses, your and your wife's assets that would need to be scheduled, the amount of available exemptions, etc., to see if you would have any problems filing a Chapter 7 and if Chapter 7 is even the best approach for you as compared to a Chapter 13.

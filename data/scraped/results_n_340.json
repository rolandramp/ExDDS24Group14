    "question": "I was in a bankruptcy cast but it was dismissed. I was also unemployed. I got a judgment from credit card institution. The form EJ-195 states that total payment now is twice as much.",

    "answers": [
        "You could pay the judgement in full, workout a payment plan with the creditor or go back into bankruptcy. You cannot force the creditor to negotiate. Take the judgement to an attorney to discuss",
        "The EJ-195 form is a renewal of a judgment. The bankruptcy was the way to get the debt discharged. Without discharge, the judgment is not affected. With the interest and other costs it is not surprising that the amount has doubled. There is no attorney who can get the judgment \"removed.\" Insofar as a payment plan, you can try to work that out without counsel."

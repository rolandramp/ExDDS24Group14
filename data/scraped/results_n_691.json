        "When a medical provider seeks payment, it relies on a contract or on a \"common counts\" theory of financial obligation. For contract and common counts claims, the statute of limitations is four years from the date of the default (not the date of the contract or when the account was first opened). See Code of Civil Procedure 337) Making a payment starts the statutory period over again. (See Code of Civil Procedure 360) Its correct that if you \"acknowledge\" a debt (or make a promise to pay), that can re-start the SOL, but after four years the acknowledgment or promise to pay must be in writing.\n\nThere is no reason I can think of that the running of the SOL would be different for your wife, except if she made payments to these creditors during the past four years, or taken some other action which would re-start the SOL.\n\nThere is no reason that I can think of for you to write to any creditor and \"admit that (you) owe the debt.\" There is no benefit to that whatsoever. Continue to monitor credit reports (at least once a year) and check county court records to see if you've been sued. You don't need to \"address\" the credit report items unless they contain errors. After seven years of delinquency or no activity, the creditors and/or debt collectors should stop reporting these debts.",

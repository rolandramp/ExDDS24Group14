    "title": "Can the claimant in a food poisoning case sue both the LLC and us personally (since we are co-owners) ?",
    "question": "My business partner and I would like to start a bakery business, baking out of a rented commercial kitchen. We are debating whether to form a general partnership or an LLC. We understand the limited liability that protects us from the business' debts and the other partner's debts. We also understand that we are always liable for our own wrongdoing, e.g. car accident while doing business. What we don't understand is what happens if someone gets food poisoning and decides to sue us. Does the LLC protect us from personal liability in a food poisoning situation?",

        "LLC is the better option of the two. In an event of a lawsuit, the way Plaintiff(s) reach your assets is done by Piercing the Corporate Veil. Make sure you follow corporate formalities; i.e. Annual meetings, Preparing minutes and creating and maintaining governing bylaws to list a few. LLC’s have less stringent requirements but they have to be followed to assure proper protection.\n\nIn instances where formalities are ignored, courts have held that the liability protection afforded to the corporations shareholders are considered waited and the personal assets can be reached by the plaintiff(s).\n\nThis is just one of the ways the corporate veil can be pierced. There are others to look out for.",
        "If the owner of the bakery is the LLC then the LLC would be the proper defendant.\nMake sure you get proper liability insurance.\nA general partnership would almost never be my suggestion, unless all the general partners were LLCs or corporations."

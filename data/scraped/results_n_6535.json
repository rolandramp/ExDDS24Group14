        "As between you and your husband, yes, you can \"take him to court\" if you marital settlement agreement places responsibility for paying the tax on him and he has not paid it. However, as between you and the IRS, it is your responsibility to pay the tax. You need to contact the family law attorney who represented you in the divorce. That is the attorney who should file the action in family law court to force your husband to pay the tax. Then you should contact a tax attorney who is expert in dealing with IRS collection issues to try to contact the Revenue Officer handling your matter to get the lien released.",
        "It depends on the terms of your marrital settlement agreement (MSA), as to who was held responsible for the tax liabilities. Your family law attorney would be the best person to address that issue. If the tax was not provided for in the MSA or has just come about, you should contact a tax attorney or enrolled agent for advice. You will likely be able to get a free consultation. From Westlake Village, I would suggest enrolled agent Don Graff in Ventura, He's top notch and gets amazingly good results. Good luck, Michael Grennier - Bankruptcy Attorney",
        "You can sue your ex. However, until he actually pays the lien, the lien will remain. You may need to consult a tax attorney because you may be an \"innocent spouse\" and entitled to some protection for that reason."

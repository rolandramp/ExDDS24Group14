    "question": "I am wondering if you can just tell the court that we have seperated all accounts at time of seperation which was in 2010 september ...why would they ask for current statements, i am glad to turn in my tax return, but why would that be not enough",

        "For further clarification, you are not required to file pay stubs, bank statements or tax returns with the court. In fact, the court does not want those things in the court file unless there is a need for them as part of a contested hearing. You are, however, when properly completing your Preliminary Declaration of Disclosure, required to attach them to the disclosures that are served on the other side. Failure to do so means your PDD's are incomplete and subject any divorce judgment to a set aside motion at a later time. Properly completed and exchanged declarations of disclosure as a necessity to prevent any problems at a later time.",
        "It's just a required set of forms. Everyone so far has been correct...but the bottom line is that you just have to do it.\n\nYou want to be as thorough as possible because if your ex ever claims that you weren't honest, it's those forms which the court will dredge up to determine if you told the truth or not.\n\nIt's not very fun, I know, but it's for your own protection.",
        "In a divorce, the court requires parties to exchange \"disclosure documents\" There are two of these, and Income and Expense Declaration and a Schedule of Assets and Debts. The Schedule of Assets and Debts, where the party marks whether a bank or other account is community property or separate can include the divded accounts, but you would need to mark them as separate. You would still, however, need to include any new accounts. The Income and Expense Declaration requires mostly new information, but you would still need to add up your \"separate accounts\" as real property and deduct debts, mortgages, car loans from them. (See page 2 of declaration at the bottom).\nThe reason the Court wants a complete listing of all accounts is because of the value the court places on parties' fiduciary duties to each other. Married persons have duties to each other to account for all money. Although you and your spouse may have divided the money and called it separate, if the Court allowed parties to simply account for past divisions, it would allow parties less honest than you and your spouse to do the same. The result could be that one party hides assets from the other. Keeping an eye on current assets, too, allows the court and the two attorneys to notice any unusual activity in the accounts that might suggest something funny going on.",
        "The parties are required to exchange certain mandatory forms, known as declarations of disclosure. They include the Income and Expense Declaration and Schedule of Assets and Debts. Attached to your Income and Expense Declaration you should include copies of paystubs for the last two months and a copy of your last tax return. On your Schedule of Assets and Debts, where appropriate, you need to disclose any and all bank accounts held by you and your spouse, whether community or separate property and whether they are in your name, her name or joint. This includes disclosing the date of acquisition of the account and the amount of money in the account. Usually, copies of the most recent statements are attached. But to answer your question, NO, there is no absolute requirement that you include copies of your bank statements, but if there is a contested issue that involves financial information, then you may have to turn them over, either through formal discovery requests made by your spouse or by court order.",
        "You will need to submit financials like a recent pay stub or tax return for disclosures or a motion with financial documents remaining. If you have an agreement you can waive disclosures but initial filing the petition doesn't require any disclosures."

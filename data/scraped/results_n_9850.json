    "question": "I have been issued a Summons for Unlawful Detainer - eviction of a commercial property for not paying the last 5 months of rent. Total amount owed is $88,000. If there is a judgement against me and they put a lien on the property that i share with my wife (we both purchase property after marriage), will the lien amount only go against my portion of the property (and therefore 50%) or is my wife liable for my part of the debt?",

        "Generally speaking, the \"community estate\" - meaning the assets owned by you and your wife - is liable for debts incurred before or during the marriage. There may be a way to negotiate down the amount of rent due and avoid a judgment from being levied against you. As to the trust, it depends on the way the trust is structured and whether you are currently receiving any funds from the trust.\n\nDisclaimer: You should discuss your situation with a local attorney, as the above statement is a general overview and does not take into account all of the factual considerations in your case. Nothing in this statement creates an attorney-client relationship."

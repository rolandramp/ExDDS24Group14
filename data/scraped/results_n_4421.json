    "title": "Can I file for bankruptcy and claim my mom's credit cards that I used?",
    "question": "I'm thinking about filling for bankruptcy. I'm not sure how in debt I am. I had credit cards in high school that were no more than $100 - $300 each. I did use my mom's which had a higher credit limit. Am I allowed to claim those on my bankruptcy? From what I've researched, I'm trying to go for Chapter 7 bankruptcy.",

    "answers": [
        "If you charged on these credit cards, you certainly have to list all debts that you owe. so basically you owe your mother for these charges and you will have to list the debt that you owe to your mother. Unfortunately your mother is still responsible for these credit cards and she will have to pay them.",
        "You need to pull your credit report. Go on www.annualcreditreport.com. That's the only free credit report website. There you will see all your credit cards and their balances.\n\nYou may not put your mother's credit cards on your BK. If you are married, you may file jointly with your husband.\n\nRecommend you consult with a BK attorney in your area. See what your total debt to income ratio is. It may not be worth filing a BK right now.\n\nBest if luck to you!",
        "No you can't file bk and claim your mom's credit cards. Think of the possible abuse if that were allowed. Yes, you are looking at chapter 7. You seem young try to pay your debts. The long term effects of a bk for small balances is not worth it in the long run.",
        "Wait a minute, here. What about your mother? She IS liable on her cards. You have no liability on her cards to discharge in a bankruptcy. You do, however, have some growing up to do. Get busy earning the money to pay for what you have charged before you trash your relationship with the only mother God gave you.\n\nBest wishes for an outcome you can accept, and please remember to designate a best answer."

        "First order of business when you learn about an identity theft is to order your three credit reports directly from the CRAs. You can get a free annual credit report and then future credit reports once you notify the credit reporting agencies (CRAs) that you are victim of identity theft. The link for this is below from the FTC.\n\nWhen you receive the reports, PHOTOCOPY them. Do not write on your originals. Then review all of them carefully for anything that you do not recognize as yours. In particular, any accounts that you never authorized, any addresses and names that should not appear for you, and any inquiries by companies that you have not applied for insurance or credit and have no accounts.\n\nOnce you have gone through the reports with a fine tooth comb, then prepare the FTC Fraud Affidavit, which I have provided, below, in the second link. The form can be completed on line and provides room on the form for all items in your report that you believe are improper (see above) and may be from this identity theft.\n\nNext step: contact your local police or sheriff's office for an appointment with someone who knows about identity theft police reports. If you just show up, unannounced, the person who helps you may be unfamiliar with identity theft and so that person may give you a run around or even simply tell you to take a hike, because this was your girlfriend. Bring an extra copy of your credit reports, as you have marked what appears to be improper, and an original and a copy of the FTC ID Theft Form.\n\nYou need the police or sheriff to prepare a report for identity theft, so you can put this report number on the FTC ID Theft Affidavit (page 5) and sign it with the officer present on page 6.\n\nOnce this is done and you have your FTC ID Theft Report completed, you need to make copies of this and the police report. First, send this to the CRAs by certified mail, return receipt requested and inform them in your cover letter that you are an identity theft victim and you need a to place a security freeze on your reports, under California law. A link to the Cal. Office of Privacy is below for exactly how to do this. It costs $10 per credit reporting agency, but well worth it, to stop your former girlfriend and other from ruining your credit and perhaps your life.\n\nOnce this is done, you're not done. Each of the companies listed on your reports that you do not believe were entitled to view your credit or that report debts that you did not approve must be contacted at the addresses noted for them on your credit reports. I have a sample letter on my web site (letter #4.1) that you can copy and send to each company. I don't know if I would provide any of them with a complete copy of your FTC Fraud Affidavit or your SSN or other information, in case these are bad people and may try to use your personal information against you.\n\nTo start, just send each company the letter #4.1 and a copy of the police report, with your SSN, DOB, and other personal numbers omitted. Don't just cross it out with a pen, because sometimes the numbers can be seen through the pen marks. Make a copy, white it out on the copy, then photo copy the copy so they cannot try to see through your white out.\n\nWhen you send any letters, be sure to keep a complete copy of every letter and send it by certified mail, return receipt requested. It costs about $6-$7 per letter, but if they deny receiving your letter, at least you have proof of delivery and a copy.\n\nShe's the mother of your child. If you don't file a police report, then these companies will argue that you approved her using your credit. If she continues her conduct, they will try to collect it from you and hurt your credit. If you file a police report, there's a chance the police or sheriff will question her and even arrest her for identity theft.\n\nIt will be sad that she goes to jail, but that is not for you to decide, if she is stealing your credit and and stealing from companies under your name.",
        "Report the identity theft immediately, including making a police report, because it gives you substantial benefits (linked below). Then get a family lawyer about the custory/visitation.\n\nDisclaimer: Please note that this answer does not constitute legal advice, and should not be relied on, since each state has different laws, each situation is fact specific, and it is impossible to evaluate a legal problem without a comprehensive consultation and review of all the facts and documents at issue. This answer does not create an attorney-client relationship.",

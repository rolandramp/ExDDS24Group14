    "title": "What should I do? I am being sued by Wells Fargo for non-payment of my credit card and my 30 days to respond is almost over.",
    "question": "I was regularly making payments until late last year. I've been struggling with a devastating illness as well as the loss of my mother and because of these challenges, I have not been able to work regularly for a couple of years. The interest added on to my original debt now makes it impossible to pay off this credit card. I am looking into filing for bankruptcy, but in the mean time, should I also file some sort of response with the courts? I've reviewed the forms, but cannot determine which one relates to my situation.",

        "Find a local \"legal aid\" office and they should be able to give you good direction.",
        "You should absolutely file an answer. You do not want a default judgment entered against you for failing to respond. You should consult with a bankruptcy attorney who will assist you in filing a timely response as well as your bankruptcy.",
        "By all means, you should respond, if only to buy time. If you can meet with a bankruptcy attorney before the response is due, you should do that first to get some bankruptcy planning perspective. I often prepare pro se answers for prospective bankruptcy clients so we have time to put together the bankruptcy petition and schedules.",
        "If you file a response but owe the debt you will only be delaying the process. You will not likely get out of the debt unless you had some legitimate reason. If you are unemployed you may be temporarily judgment proof. First I would say \"try to work something out\" with them directly - negotiate. But you are not in a position to do this right now. You can wait and see what happens. Do you have assets they can obtain? A bank account they can garnish? If not you are judgment proof - at least until you get a job with wages that can be garnished. When you are employed again you can then work out payments or meet with a bankruptcy attorney and discuss your options. Most of us offer a free consultation and it's easier to get your specific facts when advising you what to do. They will likely win the law suit, obtain a judgment, then start the process of trying to levy on a bank account, etc. You have time to figure out what to do. I highly recommend seeking competent legal assistance and asking for a free consult. I am also very sorry for your illness and the loss of your mother. And ... it's important if contemplating bankruptcy while seeking medical treatment not to shoot yourself in the foot. Problems often arise when you need more medical services but you've filed with the same hostpital where you need more medical services. They cannot make you pay a discharged debt, but they may want to see proof of insurance, etc. Making you jump through more hoops before allowing appointments again. Also something to be brought up with a free consultation. Be proactive and best of luck to you."

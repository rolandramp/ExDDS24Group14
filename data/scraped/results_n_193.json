        "You should be fine. The leasing company likely recovered the car from the impound lot in Mexico. Your obligation is to let them know what happened but you are not required to find the car.",
        "My colleagues have given you good advice with which I concur. You can file BK but be sure to explain to your BK lawyer all the details pertaining to the leased vehicle. Be prepared to defend against a possible Complaint to Determine Dischargeability of the lease debt on the grounds that your failure to obtain insurance and failure to timely retrieve the vehicle in Mexico were \"intentional acts\" with regards to the loss of the vehicle under 11 USC ยง523. If this happens, your BK lawyer will charge you extra.",
        "The lessor of the vehicle is/was entitled to know what happened to it. That said, you can file bankruptcy, and you are required to disclose what you know about the vehicle. Keep in mind that your ability to have a bankruptcy discharge of your debts can be challenged on several levels. One of those is the failure to give a satisfactory explanation for the loss or disappearance of assets.\n\nWorthy of consideration is that your explanation about the disappearance of the vehicle lacks credibility. Particularly, it is rather hard to swallow that you don't know anything more than your statement, \"it was impounded.\" By whom, where, and why? You seem very unconcerned about the car, back then and on up to the present. That raises suspicions of you hiding or transferring the vehicle with the \"intent to hinder, defraud or delay a creditor,\" which stands as another basis to challenge a bankruptcy.\n\nYour ability to have a bankruptcy granted could be improved if you can produce the official notice of impounding.\n\nNotwithstanding everything above, you can file and will probably receive a discharge if nobody objects. You really have nothing to lose. The denial of discharge means that you still owe all of the debts. If the discharge is denied, you are no worse off with respect to your debts than the situation that you are already in.",
        "Not at all; you list all the creditors involved with the lease with the best addresses one can find for them, give them notice that you're seeking bankruptcy protection, and forget about it. Sure, it would be nice to provide access to the vehicle if you could, but since it's gone, you are unable to help the creditor. If you receive a bankruptcy discharge, your personal liability on the debt will be gone, and the creditor can go after the car or not.",
        "No. The leasing company may file an objection to bankruptcy but I doubt it. For all you know the car may have been returned to the leasing company by the impound lot. If you have any correspondence on this from the leasing company, be sure to take it to your bankruptcy attorney for review."

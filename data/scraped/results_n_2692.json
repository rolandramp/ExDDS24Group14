        "Most of the time a corporate bankruptcy is like raping the company. The assets get sold at fire sale prices & no discharge means the remaining debts still exist. Anyone who guaranteed the debts probably will end up in Chapter 7 as well. shareholders should be educated before voting 'cause they are jumping off a cliff. Hope this perspective helps.",

        "The definitive answer is in your bylaws, but without more, a majority of the directors elected by a majority of the shareholders can decide to move forward over the objection of a minority director and shareholder."

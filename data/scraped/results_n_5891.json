        "If you are into the guts of the means test like this it probably means you have to do the long form version of the means test because you fail the presumption of abuse arises and you have to rebut it.

This is a mine field and the creditors and trustee will, spank you and kick you out of court for not getting it right. Spend about $500 on a retainer for a Chapter 13 lawyer and do it right the first time or dont do bankruptcy at all.",

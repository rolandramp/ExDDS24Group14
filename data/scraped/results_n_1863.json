    "title": "A company is trying to collect on a Providian Card from 2001 that I never had that they say is $5,245.34 due. Is it a scam?",
    "question": "I filed for bankruptcy In 7/3/97 following my divorce and had everything discharged on 10/22/97, and never applied for any credit cards after that. It seems strange that a company, Malcolm S. Gerald and Associates, Inc. would try and collect money from someone 14 years later especially since they say they will gladly take $1,311.34 from me and go away. Is this a scam? Are they just trying to scare me into giving them money?",

        "If the debt predates your bankruptcy petition, consult your bankruptcy attorney to prosecute in Bankruptcy Court the violation of the automatic stay and discharge order. If the debt did not exist at the time that you filed bankruptcy, then you need to find out if there is a judgment against you and get the particulars, to meet with a consumer debt collection DEFENSE attorney to figure out your best course of action and options. If no judgment, and you have not made any payments in years on this account, then it is harassment in violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, if they have threatened you in any way with a lawsuit or collection of wages or levying bank accounts. Consult a consumer attorney about collection harassment within the one year statute of limitations, if you want to pursue that claim."

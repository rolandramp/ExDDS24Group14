    "title": "I just opened a Chase bank account and the bank took all my money because of an unpaid credit card debt.",
    "question": "I just opened a bank account and I deposited all my paycheck. The next day, all the funds were gone. I called the bank and they explained that I had an open unpaid debt (credit card) with another bank WAMU and they had recently acquired that bank. It took me a while to figure out which credit card I defaulted because it happened years ago.But they left not one penny in my account- literally. I have rent to pay and need food for my family and gas money. We already live paycheck to paycheck and now I don't know what to do. Is it legal what they are doing? I thought they had to go to court to get a wage garnishment. Please save the negative comments- I know I defaulted on a credit card, that I should have paid.",

        "The \"banker's lien\" or bank setoff is permitted for situations where the depositor has incurred charges or fees related to the deposit account.

        "Very often banks have a right of setoff built into their account agreements that allows them to take money from Account B because you haven't paid them on Account A.

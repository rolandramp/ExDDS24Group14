    "title": "How long does a bank levy get released back to the defendant once the judge has lifted the levy?",
    "question": "I went to my court hearing last Monday the 17th for a bank levy that a collection agency did. The judge was in my favor and released the funds back to me. However, no one seems to know how the judge would do this (email, phone call, or by mail). I contacted the sheriffs dept in the county where the bank levy court order was served (totally different county than from where I live) but they have nothing from the judge yet. The clerk is very vague and said to look up the info on line so I did but nothing is updated. My bank said it usually takes 2 to 3 days to receive the court order from the courts. It's going on 7 days now. How els could I find out if it was ever done?",

        "You will need to take or send the Court's order to the Sheriff's Department. If an order has not been issued, you may call the courtroom's clerk and ask for assistance regarding what form you should fill out to request the court to issue an order. If an order has been issued, you may go down to the courthouse and get a copy of the order if you are unable to see it online.",
        "Without knowing the specific nature of the hearing, I can't say for sure, but it's likely the form you need is an Order Determining Claim of Exemption found here: http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/wg011.pdf\n\nYou would complete the form so that it comports to the judge's order. You would then submit the form to the court for signature. The judge would sign the form and as you can see from the body of the form, the clerk of the court must send the form to the levying officer. That agency then releases the funds as ordered.\n\nHopefully that helps.",
        "Mske sure there's an order after hearing signed by the judge. You may need to prepare that.\n\nThen send or take that to the sheriff."

        "Generally, IRS tax debt is not dischargeable in Bankruptcy. Since the IRS repayment and the debt is a priority debt, debtors are required to disclose it in Schedule J as other installment expenses or tax payments.\n\nIn addition, debtors should pay careful attention to Chapter 7 cases in which there is a positive DMI (disposable monthly income). In cases with positive DMIs, the Chapter & trustee may refer the case to the US trustee to convert to a Chapter 13 case, because of the debtors’ ability to pay back unsecured creditors.

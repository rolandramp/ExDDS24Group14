        "Let's break this down into two parts. First, until or unless you accept the assignment as Successor Trustee and all the required documentation (physician statements, etc.) has been completed, you have no responsibility to do anything. Second, even if you were to accept the assignment of Successor Trustee, your only responsibility is to manage the trust assets in a prudent manner. You will not be made personally liable for your father's debts. If the proceeds from the sale of home are insufficient to cover the amount owed, the lender can seek to collect from other assets your father might have, but the lender cannot go against you since you are not a party to the loan. As you are out of the country and no longer have legal status here, unless there are other significant assets in your father's trust or individual name which are more than sufficient to fulfill the obligations under the mortgage, it probably makes sense for you to decline appointment as successor trustee and allow the process to proceed on its own.",
        "I think I have answered your other posts. I said then and will again that in America you are not personally responsible for your parent's debt, even as a Trustee. As a Trustee you would be responsible to pay his debt to the extent of assets. If there are not enough assets, then debt goes unpaid, you do not become responsible for it. If there are assets and you have an incapacitated Trustee, you may want to seek an attorney to help you find someone who could serve in the role,\n\n\nUse the AVVO.com web site to find an attorney in the Huntington Beach area if that is where the property is.

        "I agree with Mr. Shiles. A successor trustee is not liable for the actions or failure to act of the prior trustee. In addition, you are not liable for the trust debt, unless you personally guaranteed the loan in your personal capacity. Due to the distance involved, you may not want to serve as trustee. You cannot be compelled to serve as trustee.\n\nHope this helps. If you think this post was helpful, please check the thumbs up (helpful) tab below and/or designate my answer as best answer.

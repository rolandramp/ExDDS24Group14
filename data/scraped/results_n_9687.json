    "title": "If I file for domestic partnership will my boyfriend be responsible for my debt?",
    "question": "I am female and he is a male and we are having a child together. In order for me to be covered under his medical insurance we have to get married or file for domestic partnership. I have debt that I do not want tied to him, which is why I will not marry him... but after the baby is born I need medical coverage because of a medical condition that if left untreated, I would die.",
    "answers": [
        "I do not believe that you qualify for a California Registered Domestic Partnership, since you and your boyfriend are not of the same sex, and I infer, from the fact that you're having a child, that you are both likely younger than the age for which you would qualify for Social Security \"old age benefits\".\n\nIf you want to be covered under his medical insurance, you may have to get married, unless the medical plan will recognize something other than a state-registered Domestic Partnership.\n\nCaliofrnia state registered domestic partners have the same state-law rights and responsibilities as spouses, so even if you could become registered domestic partners, his exposure to your debts would be the same.",

If you haven't looked into it, you should; it may be the answer you were looking for.\n\nDomestic Partnership is for relations between same sex couples, and carries the same rights and responsibilities as marriage -- it requires a divorce if you break up, etc...\n\nIf you have a tremendous amount of debt you may want to consider how it can be paid down, or if unlikely then you may want to consider bankruptcy as an option. That way, if you marry, your debt will not become his responsibility and your credit will slowly get restored over a 4 year period.\n\nDisclaimer.

Use it, and if needed, file ch 7 and discharge all dischargeable debts. When that vehicle breaks down, go finance one or buy another cheap one to get you through. Insurance will be cheaper on a free and clear one too. ALL 100% of clients who have said they cant find lender DID in fact find one, higher interest but that is better than car with negative equity too. Good luck..HOpe I helped too",
        "Yes you can do so, but it is a bad idea. Chapter 13 Bankruptcy is not simply filling out forms. Trying to handle this matter yourself is not wise. You do not know the USBC, you do not know the local rules of Bankruptcy and if there was an adversary proceeding started against you, or an objection filed to your plan, you would be like a deer in the headlights. To properly answer your questions and address your concerns, the best way to handle this is with an in person consultation with an experienced CA bankruptcy attorney. Use AVVO's Find a Lawyer tool to select a qualified attorney. Good luck. THIS IS NOT LEGAL ADVICE! YOU NEED TO SPEAK TO AN ATTORNEY WHO IS LICENSED IN YOUR STATE FOR LEGAL ADVICE. This is merely suggestions for you to think about in discussing your situation with the local attorney.",
        "Yes, you can file your bankruptcy petition pro se, provided you have completed your pre-bankruptcy credit counseling. Once you retain your attorney, he/she can enter an appearance and take over from that point forward. Your attorney should handle everything needed for him/her to ensure that everything is done properly. Using an attorney in chapter 13 cases is very important. In 2011, the US Courts performed a study that determined that approximately 55 percent of attorney-represented cases reach confirmation. The number of self-represented debtors that manage to get to confirmation of a chapter 13 plan at that time was 0.4 percent.\n\nIt appears that Moorpark is in the Central District of CA. You should review all the information on the website for the court in that district, especially the info for pro se filers since you will be starting your case pro se.\n\nIf you file without representation, it is up to you to make sure your auto lender and the company that will be handling the auction are aware of the filing. In addition to providing proof of filing, you should also provide proof of insurance coverage that includes collision and comprehensive coverage with the lender listed as a loss payee. If the auto is not insured, you need to inform the lender when the coverage will be in place.\n\nYou have fourteen days to complete the schedules and the plan. Thus, you need to move quickly and retain an attorney ASAP."

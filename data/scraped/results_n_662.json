    "title": "Should I file for bankruptcy?",
    "question": "I currently owe approximately $50k to the IRS and have about $15k-$20k in debt which I'm currently paying back through a debt consolidation payment plan. I also own a home which I'm selling and have about $100k in equity in it. I also make about $100k-$120k a year. Should I file for bankruptcy or find a tax attorney?",
    "answers": [
        "Consult a tax professional and BK attorney, first. You may not be a good candidate for an offer-in-compromise based on your income, unless you have large acceptable expenses. Good luck.",
        "Find a tax attorney. Your debts are not that significant given your assets and income.",
        "2 points. First there is not enough information about your tax debt to know if it is dischargeable in bankruptcy. Second, While I am not a bankruptcy attorney, you may not pass the means test to have your debts discharged in bankruptcy. Quite possibly you are looking at an Installment Agreement with the IRS.\n\nI would need to have specific information on your tax debt and current financial status to determine your best course of action with the IRS."

        "I handle so many of these cases in Los Angeles County. First, you should visit the courthouse where the case file is located to get a copy of the complaint and proof of service, but you should get a copy of the entire case file, so you have all the information at hand. Don't write on your only copy and be sure to keep records of every thing you do, as the Plaintiff's attorney believes you were served nine years ago.\n\nBad service of process happens either (a) because they have a bad address for you and handed it to someone at the old address, whom they thought lived there with you or was you; or (b) from \"sewer service\" when they were too lazy to go to your address to hand you the papers, so they filed a false statement that they went to your work or residence and served you or someone else, then mailed a copy. Sewer service happen every day, many times a day, in these collection cases and many debt collection lawyers look the other way.\n\nNow that it is nine years later you need to act swiftly to set aside the default judgment, because most judges are difficult to persuade that you just learned about it now. For the small amount involved, perhaps you should first try to contact the plaintiff's attorney to see if they will settle with you. If the amount seems fair, including interest for nine years, then do this and ensure that you have your agreement in writing and they will file a satisfaction of judgment in full with the court and withdraw any writs and wage garnishment orders that may be out there. Also, if an abstract of judgment has been filed, ensure that the satisfaction of judgment is filed with the county recorder's office.\n\nIf they will not settle for an amount you can afford and are being unreasonable with you, you need to contact an attorney to help you set aside the default judgment. I do many of these and have pretty good success, but the older the judgment, the more difficult it becomes, especially this old. My contact information and a link are below on how to check the case file for free, if you have the case number and courthouse. I look forward to hearing from you soon, if you cannot resolve your case on your own."

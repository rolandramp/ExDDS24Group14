    "title": "Will chapter 7 discharge towing & storage fees? Stop any lien process? Would they then have to release my vehicle to me?",
    "question": "After shopping my motor-home wouldn't start in Lowe's Parking lot. I talked to the security guards in the parking lot advising them I was not abandoning it. Left a note in the window as well. It was towed anyway, the head of security said it didn't matter who or what I did to prevent the tow. It was their right to have anything left in their lot towed. It did not involve a police action of any kind. It appears they were within their right to have it towed legally - morally that is a different issue.",

        "Bankruptcy can discharge debts but it cannot invalidate most kinds of liens. Liens from court judgments are one type of lien a bankruptcy can eliminate, but the type of lien from a towing company isn't a judgment lien, it is a lien created by state laws & called statutory liens. The bankruptcy laws do not provide for a way to remove a statutory lien. So as long as you don't pay the lien, the tow yard gets to keep possession of your vehicle & the size of the lien grows by each passing day. But if you intend to abandon the vehicle, bankruptcy will make sure you don't have to pay the tow yard. Hope this perspective helps!",
        "Part of your question involves issure of CA law that I, as a Florida lawyer, am not competent to answer, but there are some \"broad brush stroke\" issues you raise that I can respond to. First you are correct: Lowes was \"within their rights\" to have the vehicle towed, so that is a non-issue from a legal perspective. Also so long as no lien has attached to the motor home (a question of CA law), then the vehicle and your belongings are \"lien free\" property of the \"bankruptcy estate\" if you file a bankruptcy case. If CA law recognises a lien in favor of the towing company at this point, then filing a bankruptcy serves no purpose at all since the lien would potentially carry through the bankruptcy and you would be right back where you started. Noting that my colleagues may correctly point out that there are several potential ways for such a lien to be avoided due to timing and other considerations, I believe the amount of money you are likely talking about would not warrant the expense of such an attempt. Which gets us to the basic problem you face:\nThe real problem you are facing is a question related to the value of the vehicle and what exemptions apply to protect your interests in it. Without getting too technical about it (and noting that I do not know anything more about your situation other than what you have described) it sounds to me as though bankruptcy is not likely your best (or even a good) option. Doing what you have to (legally of course) to raise the funds to get your vehicle \"out of hock\" seems like your best course based upon the limited facts you present.\n\nGood luck to you!"

        "Of course they can sue you. But I can't think of any reason why that should affect your business (unless your business requires you to have a high credit score).\nI don't know if you would qualify for Chapter 7 bankruptcy; but that would obviously eliminate that debt as well as any other dischargeable debt you may have.",
        "Yes they can. Judging by some of my past client's experiences, American Express routinely files lawsuits and does it pretty early on after default in payments, like a year typically is what I've seen on an account this size. In California, on a breach of written contract, they have 4 years to sue within statute of limitations. If they do this, they can obtain a judgment in court and go after wages (which you don't have because you're self employed) but they can also levy bank accounts. if they don't know where you bank they can summon you to court for what is known as a debtor's exam where you will be asked to disclose under penalty of perjury your assets and sources of income. Having a levy on your bank account, where funds are frozen and then taken out to pay a creditor can wreck havoc on business or personal life. It's possible that although you may have been unable to get them to agree on a particular payment, sending what you can could keep them at bay since every payment you make resets the statute of limitation 4 years. Outside of bankruptcy option already mentioned, perhaps credit consolidation could arrange for a reasonable payment. If you can get to a lump sum of cash you could also propose a settlement, 50% is not unheard of but beware of possible tax consequences. In a settlement, you offer one or maybe a couple of large payments to settle the whole amount owed. You always want the settlement agreement in writing before you send any settlement money to the creditor.",
        "Once the consumer has defaulted on the credit card, the creditor can do what they believe is best to be repaid, including demanding payment in full, reducing the interest rate or balance, closing the account and selling it to a debt buyer, or imposing the defaulted interest rate on the account.\n\nIf you are sued in a debt collection lawsuit, please see my next steps blog, below. My office provides free consultations, if you are sued or would like help negotiating with the creditor before being sued.

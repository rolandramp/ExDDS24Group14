    "title": "Can I be charged with \"fraudulent check charges\"over 7 year old payday loan?",
    "question": "I got an online payday loan 7 years ago. Collection company \"Capital Providence\" (I cant find any information on this company or the phone number online)has stated they filed a claim on me and that they are pressing charges for writing a fraudulent check. Now what I would like to know is that possible? Also while i was arguing with them I let them know that the statute of limitation is 4 years in California and they said not for writing a fraudulent check and kept asking if I was okay with them taking it to court. I also asked if I could have their address and they would not give it to me. Is this some kind of scam? Or can they actually do these things? I did have every intention of paying back the loan,but that year we literally lost everything we had.",

        "If a company or person tries to collect money from you, even if it's for repayment of a loan, and they threaten to call the police and press fraud charges, that is extortion or blackmail. It sounds like this is an overly aggressive collection agency. Don't give them permission to go to court and stop speaking with them. Tell them that you are ordering them to stop contacting you and that you will not agree to anything. Also, put a recording device on the phone when they call and tell them you are recording their call. Do it each time they call. If they refuse to permit you to do this then terminate the cal. This sounds like a scam to me.",
        "Sounds like a scam to me. Non-payment of a loan is not bank fraud or any other type of crime. If they want to sue you, they should go ahead and then you can raise the statute of limitations as a defense. If the phone calls get to be too much, tell them to stay on the line because the police have authorized a phone tap and you want to make sure they get the phone number. They will hang up and not call again.",
        "This description is strongly suspicious for scam. A good strategy if they contact you again will be to gather as much contact information as possible while providing no information about yourself, and to demand written documentation of the the obligation. Use the information you collect to file a complaint with your state's consumer protection agency. Be assured that no creditor or debt collector has the legal power to charge you criminally or cause your arrest.

        "The payday loans should not result in a criminal charge for a bad check. At the time the loan is made, both the lender and the check writer are aware that the check is not good. Therefore, there is no fraud at the time the check is written. Further, the payday lenders hope that you don't have the funds available when the check is \"due\" so that they can write you a \"new\" loan.\nI have not seen a payday lender successfully bring criminal charges for bad checks (in Pennsylvania). I would think the same principles would apply in CA. Sounds like an over-aggressive collection agency.",
        "Nothing about this situation sounds legitimate, I too believe it to be a scam. You are correct in that the statute of limitations on a breach of written contract in California is four years. So as long as you have not paid on it within the past four years it's outside the statute and you have a legal defense to any lawsuit to collect the money.\nAs far as criminal prosecution, it is unlawful for a debt collection agency to make threats in this manner. Further, any criminal prosecution is done by the District Attorney, not a private company such as a debt collector. I can assure you, the District Attorney is not interested in prosecuting you for a bounced check from seven years ago, especially with incomplete evidence from a third party.\nMy advise would be to not speak to them again, block their number, or find an attorney to sue them for unlawful debt collection practices.",
        "If you want to \"pay back\" the loan, make sure that the money you pay is going to the correct person. You need something in writing, that you can verify with the original creditor, that this outfit actually has the right to collect. They probably do not. There are outfits that troll credit reports looking for reports of bad payday or short term loans and then intimidate or fool the poor consumer into sending them money. These outfits will not accept payment by a check sent via the US mail because they do not want to be criminally prosecuted in federal court for mail fraud.\n\nMost of these predatory lenders never file lawsuits.

    "title": "I Filed bk 7 in 2010. I worked out a modification with my 1st Mortgage lender and had a HELOC which was listed as unsecured",
    "question": "because I was underwater with my 1st. I received a $0 balance payoff statement from Chase regarding my HELOC and now 5 years later I find they never reconveyed the lien they had on my property. Do I need to file an adversary claim against them? Can they actually give me a payoff statement confirming I owe $0 then wait until I sell my house and try to collect again? Wouldn't this be handled like any other unsecured debt therefore, a statute of limitations would apply to Chase having a claim. Chase never contested the unsecured in bk and said the pay off was $0 and account was closed. They received govnt funds for loans such as these so it seems they would be trying to collect on a debt they were already paid for.Thank you",

        "Your personal liability to pay the HELOC debt is wiped out; but the lender's property interest in your home survives. The HELOC has a legal piece of your property: you gave it to them when you agreed to repay them for the money they gave you. If equity increases above the value of the first loan, the HELOC is entitled to it up to the value of its ever growing debt. If you want to explore a solution, call an experienced attorney\\broker. A Discharge is not enough: you need a \"reconveyance\" of the HELOC Deed of Trust.\n\nOptions may include: Pay the debt, explore chapter 13, explore HELOC modification, explore lump sum debt settlement, explore litigation, explore short sale or explore foreclosure by the second.\n\nThis is a common scenario and its a mistake to assume the HELOC lien just disappeared just because you personally do not have to pay. Whatever you do, don't stick your head in the sand and ignore the problem. The sooner you learn the pros, cons and costs of dealing with the HELOC problem, the better. Call for help.",
        "Unfortunately, though the Chapter 7 bankruptcy did discharge your personal liability to pay on the HELOC (the loan), it did not erase the lien that Chase has against your property. And as my other colleagues have mentioned, you cannot strip a lien in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy so reopening the case to do so would be fruitless.\nYou should start by speaking with Chase to see if they will voluntarily reconvey the lien. They sometimes do this for business reasons and sometimes through government programs akin to HAMP, but concerning second mortgages. You should also at the same time speak to a bankruptcy attorney to see whether it would be possible and worthwhile to file for a Chapter 13 bankruptcy and strip the lien off the property during this new bankruptcy. This will turn on whether your house is still underwater enough and how the judges rule in your district.",
        "The debt is not unsecured. Whether they received government funds is irrelevant. You can't discharge a mortgage lien in a chapter 7. If you wanted to strip off the second mortgage, you should have filed a chapter 13 and you may have been able to do that if the house was worth less than what was owed on the first mortgage at the time the case was filed. Your attorney should have advised you that the second mortgage lien would survive the chapter 7 discharge. Only your personal liability to pay the second mortgage was discharged. The statement they sent you is nothing more than a \"charge off\" which is just a bookkeeping entry. The second mortgage still has a valid lien on the property and they can require that it be paid in full out of a sale or refinance of the property. They may be willing to take less than payment in full, but in my opinion they do not have to because they have a valid deed of trust on the property.",
        "HELOC likely has a recorded lien on your house. Depending on the circumstances, a Chapter 13 will allow the debtor to strip his or her junior lien. There are specific income requirements in order to qualify for a Chapter 13. You may want to consult a local bankruptcy attorney.",
        "The Bankruptcy Court doesn't have jurisdiction to require a reconveyance under chapter 7. That would have been true when your case was active and would be true if you reopened it and filed an Adversary Proceeding. There is no provision in the Bankruptcy Code giving the judge the power to do this.\n\nYou may have a state law right though if the creditor was paid by another party, such as the government. I suspect that what they did was to tell you that the debt was discharged, which was true, and that as a result you owed them nothing. That doesn't, however, change the fact that they have a right under the Deed of Trust that is still enforceable.\n\nI suggest that you first find out what the position of the bank is. Did they intend to reconvey but failed to property process it? Did they get paid by the government (this may be more difficult to determine)? Have you checked the title to confirm that there was no reconveyance? Did they just \"charge off\" the loan, or admit that it was discharged in the bankruptcy and as a result stop trying to collect money from you. Remember, they can't collect money, but if they still have the Deed of Trust, the property is theirs before it is yours.\n\nIt they were paid, they owe you that deed under CA law. If not, a reconveyance would only be voluntary, not mandatory. You might need to take this up with a real estate litigation attorney.",
        "While I agree with everything Mr. Winfield said try contacting Chase and seeing their records indicate the loan is at a zero balance and, if so, see if they will release their lien. It is possible they will and if they refuse, you will be no worse off than you are now.",
        "If you owed that mortgage to Chase when you filed your bankruptcy, and you listed them as a creditor, your debt to them was discharged. That means you no longer owe the money. Bankruptcy would not automatically remove that lien, though, so there you have to look at the reconveyance. If they adequately reconveyed, then both your personal obligation (via the discharge) and the lien (via the reconveyance) are gone. I hope this gets you pointed in the right direction.",
        "The lender on the Heloc almost certainly has a recorded Deed of Trust. So even though the property was underwater the lien survives. The discharge in chapter 7 removes your personal liability but not the lien. Reopening the case to file an adversary proceeding would not change this because the Supreme Court has reaffirmed that you cannot strip liens in a chapter 7. You can strip liens in a chapter 13 even after a 7. So if the property is still under water you might want to meet with an attorney soon."

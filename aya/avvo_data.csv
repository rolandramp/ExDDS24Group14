"Husband passed away with $26k credit card debt, do creditors have a claim on our house that is paid-off & in trust?",https://www.avvo.com/legal-answers/husband-passed-away-with-26k-credit-card-debt-do-c-6130011.html,"Asked in San Francisco, CA | Nov 15, 2024",My husband had a total of 26k credit card debt with four creditors when he passed away. The cards were only in his name. $8k & 16k were with credit companies and $1k each that are now with two collection agencies.His only asset was our house. The title to the house was in a family trust where we were co-trustees and became irrevocable at his death.Am I responsible for his debt? Do they have the power to attach a lien on the house if I choose to ignore the debt?,"Bankruptcy, Debt, Bankruptcy and debt",,"You may have to deal with claims in some way, and it's better to avoid default.    What does the lawyer who drafted the trust say?        In general, a creditor may make a claim on trust assets for up to one year from the decedent's death.     You are saying that the trust became irrevocable upon your husband's death, but that would be unusual if you are a co-trustee (because what would be the point of making you a co-trustee if the house is not yours, and if the trust becomes irrevocable upon the death of your husband).     Even if the trust is irrevocable, it may not be protected from creditor claims for debt which was incurred before the trust.     As a practical matter the creditors who are claiming the smaller amounts will probably not bother, but the ones claiming $8,000 and $16,000 may sell the debt, and debt buyers may attempt to come after whoever is in charge of administering the trust.As to the community property issue, it sounds like you are saying there isn't any.  If any of the debts are community property debts, which is debt incurred while you were married, the creditor can come after community property, which includes income you earned and assets you obtained during the marriage (while your husband was alive and while you were married). It sounds like you are saying that the house was not community property, but besides the trust issue, and unless you had a premarital agreement that kept the house separate property, any income that your husband earned during his life that went into paying off the house would make that portion of it community property.",94131-ca-james-michel-182464.html,False

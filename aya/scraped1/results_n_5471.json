    "answers": [
        "My understanding is that If you worked for a corporation, the California Labor Board can only go after that corporation. That is why corporate business owners always seem to encourage use of the labor board instead of a court action to settle wage disputes, because they can't be personally liable for the corporation's failure to pay you the money you are owed in a labor board judgment. So the answer is amending the judgment (even if that were possible in this case) would likely not assist you in collecting your judgment. My best guidance is to see an attorney who is experience in labor law and civil litigation to explore your options. Good luck.",
        "Changing the name means that the individual or company you sued now has a different name - such as when a woman gets married. What you propose to do is to add on an additional party. To do that, you will need to file a separate lawsuit. Hope this perspective helps!",
        "No. Unless your original lawsuit somehow managed to pierce the corporate shield the business enjoys (for fraud, etc.) or otherwise named the doctor as an individual defendant, you're stuck collecting against the corporation. That's the whole point of incorporating or using a LLC - separating your personal assets from business assets."

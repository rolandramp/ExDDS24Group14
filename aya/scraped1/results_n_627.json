    "question": "I am a veteran filing bankruptcy, with approximately 8800 coming in after taxes. I have fallen behind on everything except house and 2 cars.

        "The bad news is that this type of income cannot be excluded from Means Testing. The potentially good news is that you are very likely not doing the means test correctly. Please don't make a bad situation worse by trying to do this yourself. Most C13s filed pro per, FAIL. That is a statistical fact.\nThe means test, written by lobbyists and lawyers, which Congress passed into law, is not intuitive. It is a combintation of science and art. There are some things about it that can be said to be fairly black and white, such as whether this type of income is exempted but there are also other things that are gray areas where some expenses can be argued as being \"reasonable AND necessary\" for a particular debtor. Please see an attorney. Save yourself the gut wrenching stress of trying to figure this out on your own and potentially disastrous losses if you choose to go ahead and file a problematic case.",
        "This is easy. DO NOT TRY A CH 13 YOURSELF. EVER. SEE AN EXPERIENCED ATTORNEY. If you have sufficient income then the law presumes under the means test what is your required payment. But a great attorney can advise on how to try to lower that amount too. So see one who KNOWS what they are doing. See 2 ..Pay and get advice and then go with an attorney you are comfortable with. Good luck.",
        "What does your lawyer say? No lawyer? Big mistake. Virtually all non-lawyer assisted 13s are dismissed due to inexperience of debtors or for failure to follow various procedures. That said, the \"Means Test\" in a Ch 13 is actually your budget compared to an average budget for a family of the same size. What your Plan payments will be is determined by the \"average budget\" with possible adjustments you can justify. Get a lawyer to help you with this so your case doesn't wind up dismissed. Attorney fees can be paid through the Plan so you can't say you cannot afford it.",

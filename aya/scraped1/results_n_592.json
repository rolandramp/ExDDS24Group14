    "question": "There is a judgement against my father whom is an elderly that my mom, brother and I take care of. We all live in the same house and also have roommates.",
    "answers": [
        "You are not in danger of having your personal belongings taken to satisfy your father's debt. Creditors with judgments typically seek cash from employment or bank accounts. (Attempting to take anything else is complex and expensive, and would not be attempted against a low-income person who doesn't own valuable property, i.e. a stock portfolio or a new Tesla.) Therefore the main way to protect yourself is to avoid having a joint bank account with your father. If he gets Social Security or public benefits, make sure those funds are kept separate from other funds.",
        "There is a legal procedure that enables you to reclaim your items. But this probably will never come up. Even if everything belonged to your dad, the law would allow him to protect all household goods, \"ordinarily and reasonably necessary to, and personally used or procured for use by, the judgment debtor and members of the judgment debtor’s family at the judgment debtor’s principal place of residence.\"\n\nBut I want you to have a consultation on behalf of your father with one or more bankruptcy lawyers. Not because bankruptcy is necessarily the answer, but because bankruptcy lawyers are experts at giving debt relief advice. Most BK lawyers will give you a free consultation. Dad's creditors all have legal advice, why shouldn't your family have the same? Especially, when it is free.",

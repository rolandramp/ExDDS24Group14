    "title": "If someone promised in writing to pay me after they filed for bankruptcy can I use this to prove fraud and nondischargeability?",
    "question": "I loaned someone money to buy a car, and after paying back approximately half of what he owed me, he filed for bankruptcy. Before he filed, however, he promised via email that he would pay me back even after he filed for bankruptcy. Now he is saying he does not owe me the money because the bankruptcy took care of it. This seems like fraud to me, and I know that certain debts are not dischargeable. Based on these limited facts, is there anything I can do?",
    "answers": [
        "You could always go to the court and review the bankruptcy filing to determine if the debtor made any material omissions in the filing. Discharges can be revoked after entry under some circumstances.",
        "You learned a valuable lesson. If there is ever a next time when you lend money to someone to buy a car, file a lien with the DMV.. Then you would be a secured creditor and you can look to the value of the vehicle to repay the debt. Alas, it is too late for you now.",
        "This will not be fraud as he made the promise to pay you prior to deciding to file BK. Everyone promises to pay back debt when they sign a contract, but BK will discharge any unsecured debt. Unless you have a lien on the car, you may not have any options for get the rest of balance.",
        "Your chances range from extremely unlikely to no chance at all. The loan transaction was done at that point, you did not rely on his statement to make the loan, and his statement was a meaningless promise that you could never legally enforce anyway. If every creditor who got some kind of \"promise\" like that could get it excepted from discharge, courts would be full. Move on, don't throw good money after bad in fees and expenses, and don't violate the law by trying to collect.",
        "It is not fraud to promise to repay a debt in spite of a bankruptcy filing. It is fraud to incur a debt knowing you are unable to repay it - or incurring a debt knowing you will be filing bankruptcy and seeking to discharge the debt - those are examples of fraud. In this situation, however, the debt was already incurred when the debtor made the promise. Also, to challenge the discharge of a debt based on fraud, you need to file an adversary complaint in the bankruptcy case before the deadline to do so and get a court order establishing that the debt is nondischargeable - a debt incurred by fraud is not automatically not discharged.",
        "Probably not. The thing is, the contract was already in place and the debtor was performing (has paid half). The email doesn't change anything as there was nothing else you could have done on your end regardless of the BK filing.\n\nThe only issue is whether you have a perfected security interest in the vehicle. Is your name on the title as a lien holder? If yes, you still have rights to the car notwithstanding the BK. If not, you are out of luck. The BK did discharge his obligation to pay you and there is nothing you can do about it.",
        "The grounds for objecting to discharge in bankruptcy are very specific and narrow. The facts as you have stated them do not make a case for non-dischargeability. Everyone who owes a debt has promised or agreed to pay it. Many also promise to pay even if they file bankruptcy. An agreement to repay a otherwise dischargeable debt after the bankruptcy is filed is called a reaffirmation agreement and must be signed by the debtor and their attorney or approved by the judge before the bankruptcy discharge is entered . You may have other facts that you have not stated that would support an objection to discharge. Review these with an experienced local bankruptcy attorney.",
        "It's a good argument. You must make it in the Bankruptcy proceeding and the time for doing so is limited so you must act quickly. Talk to a BK attorney right away to see what rights, if any, you have and how much time you have to do this. Also, you would have had to have had official legal notice of the BK so, that may play in your favor if you did not get same?"

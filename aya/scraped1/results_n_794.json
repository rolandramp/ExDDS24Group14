    "title": "Can one file bankruptcy if spouse has all ready filed?",
    "question": "I had to be taken to the hospital by ambulance and followed up with hospital care. I have no medical insurance and the bills were astronomical. My only recourse, at this point, is to entertain the thought of filing bankruptcy for the medical bills. My husband filed separately about a year ago due to personal credit cards. I was not affected by his bankruptcy. I want to know if I can now file for bankruptcy separately?",
    "answers": [
        "I hope you are on the mend.\nThe fact that your husband previously filed a (presumably now-closed) bankruptcy doesn't impose a restriction on your ability to now file separately (assuming it's otherwise advisable). The short answer is yes. :)",
        "Yes, bankruptcy may be a great option for you. Although California is a community property state, that does not mean you must file a joint bankruptcy. You may file alone, just as your husband did. An experienced bankruptcy attorney will evaluate your situation and provide you with advice as to your options.",
        "Yes you can. In fact, your spouse may be prohibited from filing with you anyway. If you are saddled with medical debt, you should contemplate filing bankruptcy and having this debt addressed. Your total household size and income will be taken into account. Seek the advice of local San Diego Counsel to ensure what your best options are. On a side note, have you looked into assistance from the County of San Diego to address your medical debt and uninsured status?",
        "Yes. I tried to submit a one word answer to your question but Avvo would not allow me to post a response that was less than 35 characters long.",
        "Since your husband qualified for Ch7 a year ago, and assuming your income and assets have not changed substantially, you should have no trouble qualifying yourself as well ... I say this with one caveat, ie., that you do not own separate property assets which could be exposed if not able to be exempted.",
        "Yes, you may file bankruptcy separately. You are required to use the same exemption code section, either 703 or 704, to protect your assets as your husband did in his bankruptcy.\nYou, of course will need to qualify for whichever chapter of bankruptcy you file. if Ch 7, then the total household income is used to determine whether you qualify. If Ch 13, you must have regular income and meet the debt limits of a chapter 13.\nI suggest you consult with an experienced bankruptcy attorney to see which chapter of relief is best for you.",
        "If you meet all of the qualifications for filing bankruptcy then the fact that your husband filed a year ago should not be a problem. You need a bankruptcy lawyer to look at your entire situation to be sure that bankruptcy is a good option for you. They will need to see your debts, income of both you and your husband and the monthly expenses you have for housing, food,utilities, etc. . Other documents such as pay check stubs and tax returns are also necessary. The attorney will also need to know of all of the assets you own. There is a lot to it, so look on AVVO for a bankruptcy lawyer near you. Hope it works out. Good luck!"

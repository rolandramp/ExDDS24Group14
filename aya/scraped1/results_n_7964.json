    "title": "Unlicensed Contractor Fraud & Abandoned Project",
    "question": "A year ago, our house got in a fire and we're paid by the insurance to repair the damage. We unknowingly hired an unlicensed contractor who at the time used another person's contracting license and claimed that he worked under that company. During the project he would often ask to be paid upfront to have the budget for labors and materials. After we paid him about 95% of the cost, he started to lag on his work and ultimately stated that he doesn't want to continue. Because my parents do not speak English very well, he had them apply for city permit under owner-builder. Is there anything we can do to him for fraud and unethical business? I know that under California law he is responsible to return all payments but what if he file bankruptcy. Any way that we can be compensated w/ his assets?",

        "Attorney Kosyln is correct that fraud is an exception to getting a discharge in bankruptcy.\n\nIn California, it is illegal for an unlicensed person to perform contracting work on any project valued at $500 or more in labor and materials. California Business & Professions Code section 7031(a) prevents an unlicensed contractor from collecting on debts owed to them by consumers under contracts due to their unlicensed status. This means that a court will not enforce the illegal contract.\n\nFurthermore, California Business & Professions Code section 7031(b) gives consumers who have contracted with unlicensed contractors the ability to sue for restitution or reimbursement of all monies paid to the unlicensed contractor for \"any act or contract.\n\nIn short, an unlicensed subcontractor will not only be unable to collect against the owner but may actually be liable to pay back to the owner every penny that was already paid him. This law applies even if the unlicensed contractor completes the job and even if the work performed is otherwise perfect.\n\nConsumers, building officials and legitimate licensed contractors can report alleged unlicensed activity to the Contractors State License Board's Statewide Investigative Fraud Team (SWIFT). To report unlicensed activity, see the information at the following website:",
        "Take your case to the lContractors State License Board. Save what money you have left, and hire a licensed contractor to finish the work. It may cost you more than the original bid, but the fight your headed into with the unlicensed person, is onerously expensive, with no remedy but a post bankruptcy litigation trying to reach into an empty pocket.\n\nThe other issue, regarding the fraud claim, my not be litigable in bankruptcy court, a recent claim against a unlicensed person was held to be discharged in Bankruptcy.\n\nWhile I am sympathetic to the issues in your case, the cost of litigation is the issue. I don't see your chances of finding a lawyer to take your case on a contingency as very great. Not when going up against an empty barrel.\n\nGo to the Contractors Board as soon as you can. The CSLB website at http://www.cslb.ca.gov/ has a place where you can assert your claim.\n\nGood luck.\n\nJoseph Melino\nSan Jose\n408/275-1955",
        "If he files for bankruptcy protection as an individual, then you're still likely to be able to pursue your claim because he committed intentional fraud, so he won't be able to discharge your claim.\n\nFraud is a \"tort\" which means you can sue him for punitive damages, but if you're worried about bankrupcty, he may not have enough money o pay you compensatory damages, let alone punitive damages. There's no theft, this isn't a crime, it's a civil matter.\n\nAs long as your inspections passed it shoudln't matter that your contractor was unlicensed, especially since the permits were owner/builder.\n\nIt may be a practical solution to settle things with this guy so he'll finish the job, but I wouldn't sign anything without seeing a lawyer first. He'll want a release of claim, you'll want reimbursement for overharges and delays, he'll want money upfroint, you'll want to make sure the payments are scheduled according to the work, with appropriate enforcement mechanisms built in."

    "title": "How should I respond to a debt collection letter?",
    "question": "The letter came from a debt collection lawyer. They are trying to collect on a debt I have from being bailed out of jail a few years ago. I asked them to provide me proof of the debt. They emailed me a few documents but the amount of the debt is not shown anywhere and none of the documents have my signature on them. They provided no actual contract or anything. I'm not sure what to do and I'm considering hiring a lawyer to help me here.",
    "answers": [
        "Bankruptcy can likely eliminate this debt and prevent them from contacting you about the debt. Hiring a lawyer would give you a buffer between them and you and would likely provide you immediate relief from having to deal with them directly.",
        "Review letter and facts with BK counsel.\nDebt likely dischargable in BK.",
        "Yes, you should follow up on your thought to hire a lawyer----I would use AVVOs find a lawyer tab and search for a debtor/bankruptcy attorney in your area----many will provide a complimentary first meeting, either in person or on the telephone so consult with 2-3 and to see how they would handle your matter and then select the one with whom you are most comfortable. Good luck.",
        "While any attorney would want to see the documents you were emailed and the documents you first received to know for sure, it seems the debt collector, in failing to provide you adequate details about the debt, may have violated your rights under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act.\n\nYou may want to consult an attorney. Happy to recommend some names if you wish. Please feel free to message me if you would like a referral."

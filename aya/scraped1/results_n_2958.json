    "title": "Divorce settlement from opposing counsel was unreasonable and seems to have sparked the flames. is this normal?",
    "question": "opposing counsel asked for me to pay for many things, which are unreasonable. is this normal course for divorce>? it makes me not want to work with him at all. if i cannot accept any of these offers what happens next? Does the court look at the financial paperwork or make an arbitrary decision about bills and what is owed?",

        "The truth is that settlement offers are usually high. That being said you still should continue to work with the opposing side and send over a counter offer. You do not want to have to be stuck paying the attorney fees of your spouse. You would likely be benefited from contracting with an attorney in your area.",
        "You need to keep in mind that \"reasonable\" is often in the eye of the beholder. In California, with exceptions too rare to bother with unless your spouse has been convicted of trying to murder you, the community as a whole will be divided substantially equally by the court. The community includes both the assets and the debts. The debt is frozen at the date of separation. If a party incurs a debt after the date of separation, that debt is that party's separate debt. If you pay a separate debt you should receive a dollar for dollar reimbursement from your spouse -- not off the top of proceeds or money in the bank because half of that is yours. If you pay community debt you should receive assets worth as much as the debt you paid -- off the top -- and whatever is left is divided. You should be less concerned about what your spouse's attorney offers and concentrate on gathering all of the information and all of the documentation that you can so you can accurately assess what there is to divide -- assets and debt. Attorneys sometimes make offers they know are not reasonable because that is what their clients want them to do. I do not think it is good practice because most often the other side just gets mad. You need to concentrate on you and the task at hand and you should at least consult with an attorney from time to time even if you do not retain that attorney. Expect to pay for the advice you get and pay heed to that advice.",
        "It's an offer. Sounds like opposing counsel is aiming high. Maybe he's doing that on purpose. Now it's your turn to counter-offer. For some lawyers, this is normal. Other lawyers start with a reasonable offer. We're not all jerks however. Sounds like you could use a lawyer on your side of the table.",

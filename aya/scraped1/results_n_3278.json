        "The period on which a collection account can be reported on a consumer credit report is 7.5 years from the date of the default. That period is known as the period of obsolescence for a collection account. If the debt is not a collection account, then a debt with derogatory history can only be reported for 7 years from date of the default. If the credit reporting agency has the correct information from the furnisher, then the debt will no longer be reported after the period of obsolescence expires.\n\nI have a sample letter, linked below, which is specifically to dispute a debt after the debt's period of obsolescence has expired. I suggest you use it, as instructed on my website, to dispute this reporting on your credit reports, after it should no longer be allowed on your credit report. If the account was only opened in 2008, then it still has several years of reporting before it must be removed. You may be correct that it is not reported accurately, so use one of my other letters if this or any information in your credit is false or inaccurate.\n\nBy: Robert Stempler (please see DISCLAIMER below)\nCONSUMER LAW OFFICE OF ROBERT STEMPLER\nA Professional Law Corporation",

        "Mr. Stempler is essentially correct.\n\nIf they change the date by re-aging the account it is also a violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act."

    "title": "Tenant confidentiality violation",
    "question": "My property management has been violating my confidentiality by discussing my personal account issues as a tenant with a friend. I have written to the regional manager and made her aware of the violations and requested a release of my current leasing obligations and I seek accommodations elsewhere. How can I do so without the penalty of breaking the lease from my end. yet received any response. I am uncomfortable with the negligent manner and release of private information under her her supervision and would like to seek housing",

        "I have to diverge slightly from my colleague's view. I agree there is no black letter confidentiality duty that applies to landlords. However, at least here in Oregon, court's have held that there is a fiduciary and/or \"special\" duty between landlords and tenants and while I have not seen that applied in a confidentiality context, depending upon the exact facts, it might at least open the door to such an argument. The other possibility that comes to mind depends upon exactly what is being revealed. Management companies/managers have been held to be subject to and liable under the federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA) and are likely to be subject to the California version as well. If the manager is complaining to others about debts, such as rent, that he alleges you owe, there might be some violations there that would be actionable. If so, and you won, you would be entitled to not only your damages but also your court costs and attorneys fees. Doesn't get you out of the lease per se but they are very likely in my opinion to be willing to let you out of the lease as part of a settlement of such a lawsuit if you otherwise had likely grounds of winning. Good luck.",
        "There is no such thing as tenant confidentiality. Absent a statutory duty such as attorney/client; priest/penitent; doctor-therapist/patient privilege, no one has a duty to keep your secrets and not divulge private information about you. There is not such thing as landlord/tenant or management/tenant confidentiality. Therefore, while morally wrong, it is not a violation of the law. They will likely not let you out of the lease without paying the penalties, and because they do not owe you any legal duty to not divulge things about you, it would not be a legal excuse for breaking the lease. The landlord will sue you and ruin your credit. You should hire a landlord/tenant attorney to negotiate your exit from the lease with the minimal cost and liability."

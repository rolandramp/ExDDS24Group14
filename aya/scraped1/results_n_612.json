    "title": "Do I have to sign this Stipulation Agreement??",
    "question": "I enrolled in National Debt Relief. All my creditor accounts were settled. But, I received this stipulation agreement that says \" I will pay creditor the sum of $5251.00 as follows, $50.09 on 7/30/18, $472.81 on 8/30/18 and on the 30th of each month thereafter until full amount is paid.\" The problem I am having is the creditor (Capital One) was paid one lump sum of $5251.00 on 7/12/18. I have also received a letter from Capital One saying Account Settled, thank you. The stipulation is from Capital One's Attorney. National Debt Relief keeps calling me to sign this. With this information can you tell me if I am correct in NOT signing? Thank you",
    "answers": [
        "Do you have a cancelled check showing that you paid Capital One the full debt amount? If Capital One was paid in July, is National Debt Relief aware of that fact? Were they involved in the settlement? Is there another Capital One account that has NOT been settled? Have you asked these questions to the people who are now asking you to sign a stipulation?\n\nThis is not the kind of question that someone can answer who has not been involved in the negotiations between your debt settlement company and Capital One or the attorneys representing Capital One. However if I were you, I would not sign anything until these questions are resolved.",
        "Provide capital one with a copy of the July 2018 payment and ask them to provide written acknowledgement of the payment."

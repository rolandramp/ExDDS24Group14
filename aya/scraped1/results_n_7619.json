        "Need more facts re type of judgment you have.\n\nMy first tendency is to disagree with my esteemed colleagues here re writ of posession and assume you have a money judgment in small claims because small claims court doesn't do those to my knowledge. Sounds like you have a money judgment and you are trying to get them to go into a private place and take an asset to satisfy your judgment.\n\nyou are entitled to make a motion and the court cannot choose to 'not be bothered' - whether you make the motion in small claims in front of a commissioner/pro tem or in front of a civil judge, well thats a diff story.\n\nIMHO you will be much less likely to get a break in order (or a 'private place' order) in front a small claims commissioner or a pro tem because they will be afraid to give such a seemingly draconian remedy.\n\nBut you are entitled to make the motion and be heard. Look at CCP 699.030. Download form SC105. Write up exactly what the property is, how you know about it, where it is and why you absolutely need a break in order to satisfy your judgment.\n\nCall civil clerk and see if you can make motion in civil dept and explain situation that you don't want to make motion in small claims. Depending on the court you may get heard by a civil judge. If you do end up in small claims you will use SC 105 and make motion under small claims rules. they don't have the option to 'not bother' to hear it.\n\nAnd whatever you do, DO NOT stipulate to a pro tem judge if you are requesting such an order.\n\nbest of luck!",

        "It appears you are seeking a writ of possession.\n\nWrit Of Possession (Claim And Delivery) - General Concepts\n\nThe writ of possession (claim and delivery) procedure is often used:\n\nto obtain possession of tangible property that is security for a debt in default (e.g., a debt secured by a chattel mortgage); to reclaim chattels that have been loaned, leased or bailed to another and not returned; to obtain property whose ownership is in dispute.\nTo obtain a writ for immediate possession of property, the plaintiff must show that he or she:\n\nhas the right to immediate possession of tangible personal property; and\nthe property is being wrongfully withheld by defendant.\nThe property sought to be recovered must exist in some concrete or \"tangible\" form, capable of identification and seizure. A writ of possession cannot be used to levy on intangibles--e.g., bank accounts, accounts receivable, etc."

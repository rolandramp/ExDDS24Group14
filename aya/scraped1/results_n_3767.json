    "title": "Can a Small Estate Affidavit be used to transfer decedent’s corporate bank account (in company’s name) to the surviving spouse?",
    "question": "The decedent died testate. The sole beneficiary of decedent’s will is the spouse. The gross fair market value of the decedent's personal property does not exceed $150K. The decedent was the sole shareholder of an S-Corp with a company bank account. Can the spouse use the Small Estate Affidavit for Collection of Personal Property to collect the funds held in the corporate bank account (the account is in the name of the company, NOT in decedent’s individual name). No probate proceedings will be held.",
    "answers": [
        "We have helped our clients obtain control of corporate assets with a small estate affidavit, and there are several more steps involved. As Ms. Eberts and others have noted, you would take ownership of the shares first. As shareholder you still then have to follow normal corporate formalities to establish yourself as the new officer/s of the corporation, and documents would be filed with the Secretary of State showing that you have control powers over the corporation. There would also be some type of winding down and dissolution required of the \"company\" if you don't plan to keep it operating.\n\nA consultation with a business attorney who would review the existing corporate documents and help you with those next steps would be the most appropriate, and should not be all that costly. Banks are increasingly particular and If you don't present the proper documents at the bank, they will not release the funds to you.\n\nYou should also discuss with the business/corporate attorney the caveats of taking control of an existing business entity. There may be liability issues, and consequences related to taking ownership and removing corporate assets, which may be relevant to you if there are any creditors or debts the company may have had. This is probably not a project you should try to handle on your own without proper counsel.",
        "Usually money in a corporate account is not personal property so I don't believe a small estate affidavit is appropriate here. It would be best to do a full probate action.",
        "It sounds like you are skipping a step. You would most likely use the small estate affidavit to acquire the shares. Then, as the sole shareholder, you would go after the bank account. But, skipping straight to the bank account would be improper.\n\nOf course, Ms. James is correct that you would also need to consult the corporate documents. S-Corps can be funny things when it comes to the transfer of shares, so you will want to see how this one deals with the issue.",
        "Look at the corporate documents to determine how/who can transfer the assets."

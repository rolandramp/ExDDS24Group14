    "title": "Would a Personal injury settlement affect my bankruptcy case ?",
    "question": "I'm planning on filing for chapter 7 bankruptcy . Recently i got in an accident and i tore my meniscus , required surgery and i'm currently in physical therapy. Would a settlement affect my bankruptcy and would the settlement be considered an asset against the debt i owe ? I was planning on filing my bankruptcy before i get the settlement anyway as i was preparing for it when the accident took place. How is the settlement treated in this case ?",

        "First, no one can advise on exemptions unless the attorney knows if you have lived in CA for more than 2 years before your case is filed.\n\nSecond, if you receive the settlement and DONT file that same month, then it will be part of your means test if you file within 6 months of receipt of it and could greatly affect your case possibly.\n\nThird, any claim is an asset. Period. Thus, if not all exempt it can be settled by the trustee subject to your exemptions. As a result, you really need to know other facts and issues can gravely affect your case so I will point those out next.\nYou need and want to enjoy your fresh start also. But the most important thing is to meet with an attorney as you asking this question means you have not. You care about 2 goals: keeping everything you have equity in and discharging all your debts. If you don't have any of the exceptions to discharge you will obtain that goal; most exceptions are set forth in 11 USC. 523 (Google it) like child support, some income taxes, traffic (in a ch 7) and criminal fines , and presumption of student loans. But some debts are dischargeable in a ch 13 but NOT in a ch 7 so you want to make sure and your attorney will discuss any such types with you also!\n\nYour exemptions depend on what state you have lived in in the last 2 years and thus if in your state, then your states exemptions will apply. Most persons filing keep everything they own but your attorney will confirm that with you when they learn everything you own and the equity thereof!\n\nSome secured debts like homes, vehicles, other secured debts an attorney will discuss your options on also as you must list any debts; but that does not mean you will lose them unless you have too much equity or are in default on paying for them! Discuss those options if they apply with your attorney too.\n\nBut other issues can arise that can greatly harm your case. Just one example: If you paid back a relative $3,000 11 months ago and now file bankruptcy next week, the trustee can SUE that relative to retrieve that $3,000 (under what is called a preference) for the benefit of the bankruptcy estate. As a result, most attorneys don't charge to meet with them the first meeting so meet with one no matter what.\n\nMany great attorneys can be found right here on AVVO in your state so look, call, and meet one as soon as you can.\n\nYou should also want to know when to file: is there an advantage of waiting versus filing now and who should you pay between now and then! Good luck and enjoy your later fresh start.",
        "To add to the other answers.\nCalifornia has 2 sets of exemptions. Generally, if you own a home with equity in it, you choose one set. If you do not own a home or the home has no equity, you choose the other set which has a wild card exemption of about $20,000. Both have a number of other exemptions some of which you will use depending on what you own and how the personal injury award is structured.\nTake all of your information to an experienced Bankruptcy attorney.",
        "You should consult with and retain an attorney to assist you. Yes, your claim against the at fault party is an asset that will have to be reported to the bk court and trustee. Whether you'll be able to protect It through California's exemption statutes depends on what California's exemption statutes allow to be exempted, what other property you have to protect and other considerations. An experienced attorney will be able to assist you to maximize what you can protect.",
        "I hope you were planning on having an attorney represent you in your bankruptcy, especially now with this personal injury issue. There are either state or federal exemptions in bankruptcy that protect certain amounts of your assets from the reach of the trustee. Your attorney can apply the exemptions in such a way as to best benefit you. I take it that liability for the accident is not an issue. Pre-planning is going to be essential in your case.",
        "Whether a settlement will affect your bankruptcy will be decided by what other property you own. Exemption laws only cover so much property. More information about exemptions is at the link below. Settlement of an injury claim is just another asset that a trustee can take for creditors if not exempt.

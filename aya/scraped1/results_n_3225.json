        "The filing status on your return is used in part to determine who is responsible for the items on the return, and this includes the resulting tax liability. So, if you did not file a joint return with him when he incurred the tax liabilities, you would generally not be liable. Going forward, a married couple may elect to file their returns separately. Each person’s filing status would generally be Married Filing Separately. You may want to file separately if you believe your spouse is not reporting all of his or her income, or you do not want to be responsible for any taxes due if your spouse does not have enough tax withheld or does not pay enough estimated tax.\n\nOn the other hand, if you file jointly, you may be held responsible, jointly and individually, for the tax and any interest or penalty due on your joint return. This means that if one spouse does not pay the tax due, the other may have to. Or, if one spouse does not report the correct tax, both spouses may be responsible for any additional taxes assessed by the IRS. Importantly, one spouse may be held responsible for all the tax due even if all the income was earned by the other spouse.",
        "This is a more complicated question than simply whether to file joint or separate tax returns, since CA is a community property state.\n\nThe community property is responsible not only for the debts of the community, but also for the debts of either spouse incurred before marriage. So, the answer to your question will depend on the nature and extent of your present separate property assets and community assets going forward.\n\nTo protect your separate property, you need to keep it separate. If you do not know how to do this, I recommend a consultation with an attorney if you have separate property you wish to protect.\n\nA post-marital agreement, coupled with keeping your separate property separate, will help. Keep in mind, however, that changing the nature of default provisions re community property laws in CA may have adverse consequences for inheritance or dissolution purposes.\n\nMy recommendation: if you want your marriage to work, work on paying down your spouse’s tax debt as a matter of first priority. Financial stress created by debt is a major reason marriages do not work. Good luck."

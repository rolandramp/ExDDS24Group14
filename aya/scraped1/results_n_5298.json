    "title": "After a parent's death and at the settling of an estate is it usual to reserve some funds before distributing to the heirs?",
    "question": "The executor of the estate has been advised to reserve funds for possible costs that may arise in the next year. Is this necessary? If so, how much? Future costs would include final payments to attorney and CPA, but there is no long outstanding debt.",
    "answers": [
        "Yes, it is very common. The amount depends on the size of the estate. Often $10,000 is a number in moderate size estates ($500,000 or less), unless it is believed there may be open issues with the IRS (statute of limitations on the IRS and FTB can extend up to four years from filing of a tax return) IRS is less time than the FTB.",
        "As the others have advised you, it is very common and, additionally, the prudent thing to do. Requiring the expertise of a CPA is a good example of an additional expense. As to attorney's fees, however, a court order would be required for any additional fees incurred subquent to an order for distribution. The amount depends on the size of the estate and whether there may be complicated tax issues etc. Sums of $5,000, $10,000 or even $25,000 are not unusual reserve amounts. All funds remaining after a reasonable period of time should then be distributed to the beneficiaries according to the terms of the distribution order.",
        "We almost always advise a reserve be retained. There are likley to be additional income taxes, legal fees, unecpected debts or similar expenses. This is a pretty standard procedure.\nThe reserve should, however, be fully accounted for. When it is distributed an accounting of the initial reserve and all income or expenditures should be made to the beneficiaries.\nIn a large estate where a Federal Estate tax return is required, we may reccomend the reserve be held until audits of income tax and estate tax returns would be completed. We usually suggest 3 years from the filing dates. This long delay woud not be needed in most small estates. The timing and amount is a judgment call based on the estate complexity, magnitude and potential risks.",
        "Yes, that's common. There are usually costs in wrapping things up. Most common is to hold back some money to pay taxes, which vary, of course, from situation to situation. Because of that variability it's hard to say how much in your situation is necessary.",
        "Yes, it is very common. It is also very common to be ultra-conservative in how much is being retained. It is always easier to hold money back than it is to go back to the beneficiaries after a distribution and seek repayment of funds.\n\nJames Frederick"

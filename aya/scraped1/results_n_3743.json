    "title": "Do I need a certified copy of a death certificate to send to my friends debtors once he dies?",
    "question": "I have both a power of attorney for finance and a power of attorney for general health. Once my friend dies do I need a certified copy of a death certificate to send to my friends debtors and advising his pension fund and social security or would a certified information copy of the death certificate work. My goal is to let everyone know when he dies so that money stops coming in and the debtors know he has passed",

        "You should meet with an estate planning attorney to discuss the various aspects of this situation. You need to determine if he had any kind of estate plan in place and if so how that impacts the steps you should take next. If no plan was done, you may need to open a probate to try and collect the outstanding debts owed to your deceased friend. It would be best to talk with an attorney asap.",
        "Typically after someone passes, the exeuctor or trustee will order ten death certificates - sometimes this can be easily done for you at the funeral home. You can send a letter to the social security administration, pension, veterans administration (if applicable), etc. It is not mandatory to send them a death certificate.\nI agree with my colleague - make sure your friend has a will at a minimum and a trust if his estate is over or close to $150,000.00\nI would suggest speaking to an attorney after he passes to gain clarity of all the proper procedures that must be taken after someone passes.",
        "Well, once he passes, your power of attorney duties end. Then it is up to the estate - does he have a will? If not I hope that someone is prepared to be adminisrator. You also mention debtors - so people owe him money? Just because someone dies, it does not necessarily mean that people who owe him money stop owing him money - many times the estate can recover funds due to the deceased person's estate."

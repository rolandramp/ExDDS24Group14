    "question": "My husband and I separated 11 years ago.he stayed in condo all that time since. Most of that time I wasn't even on title.I never even visited the place. Now hoa is suing me personally for unpaid dues. He got condo in divorce but he didn't pay dues for a year before that. Do I have any defenses for time I was on title? What about after I was off?",
    "answers": [
        "Your question requires a little more information. What do you mean that most of the time you were not even on title? When were you on title? As part of the divorce, did you sign a deed transferring your ownership of the property to him? If yes, was the deed recorded? You would be responsible personally for the HOA for the period of time that you were in title.",
        "The years that you were on title are important for statute of limitation reasons as well as liablity reasons. If you were on title and the statute of limitations has not passed you may be liable. The next quesiton is whether the past arrears are only due by the current owner of the property? State by state condo assoc. rules change. The marital settlement agreement is a dead end; those, at best, give yo ua right to get reimbursed for paying a debt for an ex-spouse. Speak with a local attorney after you have nailed down the dates you were on title.",
        "You may have a statute of limitations defense or contempt in divorce court."

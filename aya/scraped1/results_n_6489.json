        "The parties exchange Preliminary Declarations of Disclosure and if needed, discovery (Interrogatories, Requests for Admission and/or Demands to Produce, and possibly take the other's Deposition), and when ready to resolve the case, the parties exchange Final Declarations of Disclosure and then settle the case with a Stipulated Judgment and associated documents, or if they are unable to do so, one party files a Request for Trial Setting. You may be best off retaining or at least consulting an experienced Family Law Attorney regarding your divorce.",
        "The next step would be for each of you to exchange Declarations of Disclosure (FL-140) with the accompanying Income and Expense Declaration (FL-150) and Schedule of Assets and Debts (FL-142). Once these are exchanged you each need to file the Declaration Regarding Service of Declaration of Disclosure (FL-141) with the court.",
        "You have to do something affirmative to move your case forward such as file a motion for support or start negotiating a settlement of your case, the latter which I would suggest. There are several lawyers on Avvo, including me, who handle cases in your area and offer free consultations and affordable rates. Call a lawyer and ask them to review your case."

    "title": "How can I collect on a judgment from CA Labor Board that was in my favor when the LLC judgment debtor has filed bankruptcy?",
    "question": "I am an independent contractor who worked for a music festival in Napa Valley in May 2013. They reneged on paying my wages and I filed a suit with the CA Labor Board. In July 2014, the judgment was found in my favor with the debtor owing both wages and penalties. However, the debtor was an LLC that has since filed for bankruptcy. Has that taken away my chance of collecting on this judgment?",
    "answers": [
        "You should really hire a licensed attorney, experienced in this area of the law in order to really best protect your interests. That being said, the LLC will not be able to obtain a discharge in bankruptcy, so if the LLC still has assets you can execute on those. You may also be able to add the actual owners of the LLC to the judgment using either an Alter Ego theory of liability, or through the Affidavit of Judgment process. I would definitely check with the Labor Board to see how far they will help with this matter.",
        "Immediately file a Creditor's Claim in the BK case. You must file before statutory deadline. Unpaid wages are a priority debt.\nIf an asset case, you may be entitled to partial or full payment.\nIf corporate veil pierced, you may be entitled to collect from owners of LLC.",
        "You can file a creditor's claim in the bankruptcy proceeding. There are time limits for filing creditor's claims. Did you receive a notice of the deadline to file a creditor's claim? Perhaps the Labor Commissioner can assist you with preparing the claim and understanding the deadline.",
        "Wages owed are a priority debt in a bankruptcy.\n\nI will change the designation.",
        "Unfortunately, you will be unable to collect this judgment if the entity has dissolved. You may be able amend the judgment to include the individual who owned the LLC, if the corporate veil can be pierced."

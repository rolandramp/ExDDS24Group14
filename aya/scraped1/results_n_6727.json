    "title": "Can I sue Equifax for false reporting or continued reporting of incorrect information?",
    "question": "I have been disputing a Target account since December 2011 and thereafter on a monthly basis. I have contacted Target directly and they have even submitted the letter for a $0 balance (it was included in my bankruptcy) on the account to all of the credit agencies and Equifax still reports it incorrectly. I'm tired of disputing it but it drops my credit score 20 points every time this happens. Every time I submit the dispute online, it eventually gets fixed but the next month it again reports the wrong information. I don't know what else to do other than to sue? Any advice?",

        "This is not an uncommon situation. You should meet with an experience FCRA attorney to discuss your options. Also, best bet is to file disputes in writing and mailed to the credit bureaus. There is no private right of action for failure to reinvestigate based on DIRECT DISPUTES to the furnisher (Target). You must file disputes with the credit bureaus, who must then forward the dispute to the furnisher as well as conduct their own reasonable reinvestigation. If the bureaus and your furnisher fail to properly reinvestigate your dispute, the FCRA provides relief for consumers and, yes, the bureaus and furnishers can be sued.\n\nThere's a lot that goes into why deleted items are reinserted into credit reports, but it's more than can be said in a Q&A on a website. Please consult an experienced attorney in your area.",
        "Something is fishy here. You say that Target is reporting the debt as \"zero balance\" and the bureaus are reporting it \"incorrectly.\" But what is the exact \"incorrect language\" used that is lowering your credit score (of course th bankruptcy would lower it much more if it is at all recent). Because you are a California resident, you can can use under the superior California law instead of the federal law. Feel free to contact my office for a free consultation.",
        "You should dispute the items in writing by snail mail (US Postal Service, not online) to all 4 credit bureaus (Experian, Equifax, Trans Union and Innovis). Attach a copy of the documentation that you do not owe the money. The credit bureaus have an obligation to investigate, and to forward your dispute to the credit furnisher (Target). If the item is not removed, you may have a claim under the Fair Credit Reporting Act. You should consult a local attorney experienced in consumer credit matters."

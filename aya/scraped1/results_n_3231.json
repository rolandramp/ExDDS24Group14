    "title": "What can I do to stop DCFS from bothering me for an overpayment?",
    "question": "I filed Bankruptcy in Nov 2012 (discharged 3/13). I informed DCFS of the Bankruptcy in April 2013, but they keep sending me over payment notices. Received 2 notices in the last 30 days. I call them each time I receive them and say I filed Bankruptcy but the notices of action keep coming.",
    "answers": [
        "I'm not sure everyone read your question fully. This is an overpayment made to you by DCFS for, I assume, child support or alimony, correct? If so, then this is not a domestic support obligation that YOU owe so it may very well have been discharged (assuming this overpayment occurred PRIOR to you filing your bankruptcy case.\n\nThis would require some research and more facts are needed. It's a rather unusual scenario where there are overpayments in a domestic support scenario (assuming that is what this is).",
        "First, is that for a child support or state agency re support? If so, it is not dischargeable.\n\nSecond, if Not in any way related to child support, send them one final letter, with a chronology of all facts including you filing, discharge, they listed, copy of discharge and the times you have called and spoke to them; ask them to identify if they believe the debt is NOT discharged which provision in 11 USC 523 do they believe applies. and to send that in writing to you. otherwise, ask them to cease all communications with you. Send return receipt requested so you have proof. Then if you ever receive any communication other than for a non dischargeable debt, obtain an attorneys assistance to sue them in bankruptcy court!",
        "Child support and alimony obligations are not dischargeable. So if the debt relates to either of those things, they can send you notices.",
        "I'm not sure if you put DCFS in the Bankruptcy but even if you did not I doubt you have any liability. Perhaps you can track down where these notices are coming from and talk to someone more knowledgeable",
        "What is the debt for? Assuming DCFS is the Department of Children and Family Services, it is quite possible that the debt was not discharged.",
        "There is not enough information in your question to properly answer. Is this for child support? Child support is not a dischargeable debt."

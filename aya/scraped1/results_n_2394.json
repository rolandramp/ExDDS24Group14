    "question": "I have lawsuits and debts. The lawsuits are disputed and I expect we will win, because the statue of limitations ran out. What would happen if my parents paid off my debts?",
    "answers": [
        "You can voluntarily pay off your creditors notwithstanding a bankruptcy case. Like the other lawyers who have commented here, it may not be prudent to do so if the debt was otherwise dischargeable in the bankruptcy case. If they really want to help you, you/they might be much better off using their hard-earned money to help establish a good monetary foundation and credit lines AFTER a successfully concluded bankruptcy case.",
        "In addition to echoing the other answers, I will add that the Chapter 7 filing is a public record, even if you dismiss, so it will remain on your credit report.",
        "They would probably be wasting their money.",
        "Most of the time, if a creditor files an Adversary Proceeding against you to collect, the matter can be settled for a significantly reduced amount. But it sounds like you just want to bail on your Chapter 7 after realizing that it wasn't appropriate for you. Unfortunately, that isn't likely to persuade a bankruptcy judge to allow you to withdraw your Chapter 7 case. Once you file Chapter 7, it is like jumping off a cliff. No Superman to save you before you hit the ground. Hope this perspective helps!",
        "I suppose they could but why would they? If you file a Ch7 bk, absent any Adversary Proceedings seeking to challenge the dischargeability of specific debts, the debts you owe at the start of the case will be discharged at the conclusion of your case when you receive a discharge. Why pay them at all? If they sue you prior to the filing of the Ch7, you should either file an answer asserting any defenses to the allegations in their complaint, including the running of the statute of limitations or file your bk ASAP. Paying the debts would likely be throwing your parents money away."

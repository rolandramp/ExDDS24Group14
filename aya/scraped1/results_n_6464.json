    "title": "Can a landlord add additional costs after a judgement has been awarded?",
    "question": "We went to court, we filled out stipulations, they were presented to the judge, everyone agreed and the judgement was awarded for $3,200.00. I went to the apartment complex office because we had not heard or recieved any type mail in regards to the judgement and/or the eviction. Now the landlord/manager wants us to sign a payment agreement for $5,232.00. When I asked for there supporting documentation she got mad and she couldn't explain why and what she did explain, didn't make sense at all. Shouldn't of all this been brought up in court prior to the judgement? I can understand cleaning fee's but that was taken from the deposit and they claim they applied the rest of the deposit towards the debt. we sisn't sign anything. Which made her even madder.",

        "They cannot add anything to the judgment, except interest and post-judgment court costs if they file a proper Memorandum with the court.\n\nHowever, the Unlawful Detainer may not have included all of the landlord's claims. A UD can request only rent. If there are other amounts owing which were not included in the 3-Day Notice to Pay Rent or Quit, such as late fees, damage to the premises, other charges, etc., they can ask for payment.\n\nDid the Stipulation that you signed at the court include a waiver of all claims, but either side?",

        "If the judgment was entered for a set amount, that's what they are entitled to collect, plus state-set interest on the judgment and any \"costs\" like filing fees, etc. The total amount of the judgment should cover the costs, but interest does accrue. They are simply trying to take you for a ride - you owe the judgment, nothing more."

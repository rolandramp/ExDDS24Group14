    "title": "What is an ex parte? What are the steps to file one to release funds from county?",
    "question": "I have been in a very very long court battle to get the remaining funds in my dad's estate. We finally got an approved final order from the judge. My lawyer I feel has been putting off sending the ex parte petition to the court house. My question is how long does it take to get the judges signature and where is the form taken so they can process and release the funds. And how long does it take? I have not been able to get any answers from my lawyer and I am left in the dark",

        "An ex parte order is one that is entered without a noticed hearing. It may be that even though you have an order for final distribution, the judge previously ordered money placed in a blocked account -- that is, no withdrawals without court order. Once the estate is closed and you have an order for final distribution, the bank/financial institution may want a separate order authorizing the release of funds from the blocked account. That's the only reason I can think of for having to get an ex parte order. I don't practice in Los Angeles, and defer to other counsel's experience with getting orders through the system. You should contact your attorney to find out what the hold up is.",
        "Agree with colleagues. Ex parte is a request for some type of emergency action. Next step is to file Order on petition and distribution of funds. There is no specific form for this purpose. Common for it to take up to several weeks in Los Angeles for judge to sign the order. I recommend that you discuss concerns with your attorney.",
        "An Ex Parte is a motion filed requesting relief because something bad is about to happen. A final order as stated is NOT an ex parte matter. A final order should be done by a petition setting forth the assets, debts, an accounting of the estate and other required disclosures and this is then set for a hearing and all interested parties must be given a notice. Again, this is not done ex-parte. Write a letter to your attorney demanding the date that has been set for approval of a final order. Why is the county holding funds of an estate? You can always fire your present attorney and seek new representation.",
        "The document in a probate that gives you the authority to release assets from the estate is called an Order on Petition for Final Distribution and is not an ex-parte order. Sometimes judges to take a while to sign them, but if it has been several weeks, there might be an issue. You need to pick up the phone and get specific answers from your attorney regarding when it was submitted to the court and if he has followed up and when. The ex-parte order in probate happens after all money has been distributed, receipts have been filed with the court and you are ready for the court to discharge you so that you no longer have duties as an administrator/executor. It doesn't sound like you are there yet.",

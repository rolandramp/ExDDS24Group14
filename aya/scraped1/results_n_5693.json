        "When it comes to service a server must use enough effort to reasonably reach the party that he attempts to serve. The amount of effort, number of times, and locations varies based on the facts. But an argument can be made that additional service attempts should be made if it appears that they will yield a successful service ultimately.",
        "First of all, any good process server you are using should know the rules for service and how to effectively serve someone in different situations. So, if your process server is clueless on this, you might want to look elsewhere for assistance. Aside from that, your facts do not indicate what you are trying to serve. Depending on what you are serving, the rules vary somewhat. In general, however, with your fact situation I think California Code of Civil Procedure Sect. 1989 probably would apply, and states, in pertinent part:\n\"Sect. 1989. Nonresident Witness. A witness, including a witness specified in subdivision (b) of Section 1987, is not obligated to attend as a witness before any court, judge, justice or any other officer, unless the witness is a resident within the state at the time of service.\"\n\nSo, if you are trying to serve the witness with a subpoena to appear at trial or for a deposition, I think you are out of luck. If you are trying to serve a subpoena for business records, then if the attorney whose address has been given states that they are in fact representing the witness and will accept service, then you can serve the lawyer. If not, and you need to personally serve the out of state witness for whatever reason, then the easiest way is to fax the papers to a process server that is in the state where the witness resides and have them serve the papers. If that option is available, then you can't file a declaration of due dilligence at this time since you haven't actually exhausted your due dilligence since you haven't tried having an out of state process server complete the service.",
        "The lawyer has been designated as the person who will accept service upon the witness ... you just have to serve the lawyer. Hand the Notice to his secretary.\nOr file BK to stop the whole process."

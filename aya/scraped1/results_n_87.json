    "title": "Can a creditor recover from a revocable trust if the debtor is a beneficiary?",
    "question": "If I am the beneficiary of a revocable trust, but have not received any disbursements because the family member who created the trust (the settlor) is still alive, can a creditor who has a judgment against me recover from the trust in some way? If I discharge the debt in chapter 7 bankruptcy before the settlor dies, can I then keep all the money or other property that the trust entitles me to after the settlor dies?",

        "Maybe. When a person prepares a trust and knows that some of his beneficiaries may have trouble with creditors, a \"spendthrift clause\" can be included. A trust with a spendthrift clause is an ideal estate planning tool in situations where a beneficiary has demonstrated an inability to handle money responsibly for any reason. However, each spendthrift clause must be carefully drafted to accommodate the circumstances. Such clauses are valid in the US and even some foreign countries."

        "It would appear you have minimal assets and could consider a Chapter 7. Sometimes the local Federal courthouse has pro-bono attorneys that can assist you with the preparation of the forms.",
        "By asking that question it means to me you have not done the ONLY thing you need to do: meet with an experienced bankruptcy attorney first..its free normally to do so. You would already know: YOu must list ALL debts in ANY bankruptcy. Simple as that! How a lease is affected depends on your goals and your attorney will discuss that with you.\n\nOther facts and issues can affect you case too so I will point those out so you know to call an attorney NOW FIRST. You need and want to enjoy your fresh start also. But the most important thing is to meet with an attorney as you asking this question means you have not. You care about 2 goals: keeping everything you have equity in and discharging all your debts. If you don't have any of the exceptions to discharge you will obtain that goal; most exceptions are set forth in 11 USC. 523 (Google it) like child support, some income taxes, traffic (in a ch 7) and criminal fines , and presumption of student loans. But some debts are dischargeable in a ch 13 but NOT in a ch 7 so you want to make sure and your attorney will discuss any such types with you also!\nYour exemptions depend on what state you have lived in in the last 2 years and thus if in your state, then your states exemptions will apply. Most persons filing keep everything they own but your attorney will confirm that with you when they learn everything you own and the equity thereof!\nSome secured debts like homes, vehicles, other secured debts an attorney will discuss your options on also as you must list any debts; but that does not mean you will lose them unless you have too much equity or are in default on paying for them! Discuss those options if they apply with your attorney too.\nBut other issues can arise that can greatly harm your case. Just one example: If you paid back a relative $3,000 11 months ago and now file bankruptcy next week, the trustee can SUE that relative to retrieve that $3,000 (under what is called a preference) for the benefit of the bankruptcy estate. As a result, most attorneys don't charge to meet with them the first meeting so meet with one no matter what.\nMany great attorneys can be found right here on AVVO in your state so look, call, and meet one as soon as you can.\nYou should also want to know when to file: is there an advantage of waiting versus filing now and who should you pay between now and then! Good luck and enjoy yo ur later fresh start.",
        "I see no reason why you could not file a chapter 7 BK, but to be sure, set up 2-3 consultations with 5 star rated BK lawyers in your area. Many offer a free consultation by phone or in person. BK is not a DIY project.",
        "Yes, you can list this lease on your bk petition and schedules and discharge your liability for the lease. I strongly recommend you consult with a local bankruptcy attorney to assist you in filing."

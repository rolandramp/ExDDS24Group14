        "If you are concerned about a garnishment do not deposit funds in the account because you may not get them back. You should also check the garnishment procedures in your state to see how it is done and if you are entitled to any exemptions, and if your are how to assert the exemption.",
        "No, you won't be able to find out ahead of time whether your bank account has been levied upon, nor will anyone tell you whether or when your bank account will be levied upon.",
        "Getting a heads up, so to speak, would undermine the effectiveness of this tool for the creditors. People in your circumstances typically use check cashing places or talk with a bankruptcy attorney about discharging their debts to get a fresh start. If your creditor(s) know where you bank, a levy can happen sooner rather than later. When will it happen? Whenever the creditor gets around to it and they can do it multiple times.\n\nIf they don't know where you bank, creditor can request that a judge summon you to appear in court to disclose your assets. It's called a debtor's exam and if you receive such a summons do not ignore it."

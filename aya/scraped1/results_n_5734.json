        "I agree with much of what has already been posted, but if you have debt other than this one credit card, then your best option would be to get a consulatation regarding Bankruptcy, as this may relieve you from the stress of having to file a Claim of Exemption. My office provides free Bankruptcy consultations and we are in Fresno and Madera. (559) 472-7337",
        "Why didn't you go to court when the case came set for trial? Were you served with Summons but decided to ignore the matter because you had something more important to do? Or, were you never served with a Summons? Check the court's file, then consult an attorney. You may have a basis to set aside the judgment, or BK may be appropriate, or a Claim of Exemption, or some other course of action.",
        "I agree with the other answers; but if you're unable to exempt most or all of the money in your account, you'll need to get a bankruptcy filed a.s.a.p. Then, depending on how much was actually levied, it may be possible to have it returned to you.",
        "Along with the notice of levy, you should have been given instructions and a form called \"Claim of Exemption\" (California Judicial Council Form #EJ-160). If not, you can get the form online here: http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/ej160.pdf\nSimply fill out the form and return it to the levying officer within the specified time, in order to claim an exemption in some or all of your assets. For help in determining which exemptions apply to your financial & asset situation, you can consult with a local bankruptcy attorney (many will offer a free initial consultation) or the self-help desk at your local Courthouse. Essentially, the claim of exemption form is the mechanism by which you can claim an exemption in certain of your assets, protecting them from levy for the judgment. Also, if you elect to consult with a local bankruptcy attorney, they will also be able to review your entire financial situation and determine if a bankruptcy might be a good option for you. If so, then you could make the levy and the underlying judgment go away completely, along with all of your unsecured debt.",
        "If you are a debtor in California who has difficulty satisfying a judgment after being served with a Writ of Execution, you can file a Claim of Exemption along with a Financial Statement. A Claim of Exemption is a form a debtor files with the levying officer (like the sheriff) explaining why the wages that the creditor wants the debtor’s employer to garnish should be exempt (excluded).\n\nThe forms are:\n\nhttp://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/wg006.pdf\n\nhttp://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/wg007.pdf\n\nTurn in 2 copies of the Claim of Exemption (Form WG-006) and the Financial Statement (Form WG-007) to the levying officer in your case (like the sheriff) within 10 days of receiving the Notice of Levy. Keep one copy of both forms for yourself.\n\nYour employer will hold on to the money garnished until 10 days go by and the creditor hasn’t opposed the claim of exemption, or the judge makes a decision at the hearing on the claim of exemption. If the creditor doesn’t oppose your claim of exemption, your employer will return the wages to you. If the creditor opposes your claim of exemption, you will receive a Notice of Opposition to Claim of Exemption and Notice of Hearing on Claim of Exemption that will set a court date for a judge to make a decision. If the judge agrees with your claim of exemption, you will get the money back. If the judge agrees with the creditor, your employer will send the money to the creditor every month.\n\nFor Claim of Exemption for non-wage garnishments, use Form EJ-160 instead of WG-006:\n\nhttp://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/ej160.pdf"

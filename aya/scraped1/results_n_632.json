    "title": "Can someone give me as much advise on what my options are? Can I claim personal bankruptcy w/o affecting my husband?",
    "question": "A year ago I decided to get out of personal credit card debt. I went with National Debt Relief. A year into the program they called me and said I was doing so good that a third party wanted to help me out and finish paying my credit cards . I unfortunately agreed. Liberty Lending is the #rd party. They have not finalized the loan because there is one payment on 8/31/18 of $121.00 to be made. I am freaking out because the amount that they estimated I would be paying them back seems to be way more than what they actually paid ( $13,870.00 ) to my credit cards. They also have it on a 60 month term at 23%. If this is going to put me right back into debt. My husband thinks I should close my checking account and cancel the loan. LL is saying there is no way to cancel the loan. I really don't know what to do. I have no issue paying them what they paid but for 60 months at 23% I just can't. Any information will be greatly appreciated. The total amount that was paid to my credit cards by myself and LL is $19,769.23. The total amount enrolled into the National Debt Relief program was $45,158.00",

        "No attorney can tell you whether you filing will \"affect your husband\". Why? We dont know what are any community property claims which if incurred during marriage in CA then they are! WE dont know each of your incomes, household size, debts, type of debts, equity in assets, and any other separate property of each. As a result, you only have to learn one simple thing: FIND AN EXPERIENCED CA BANKRUPTCY ATTORNEY AND MEET IN PERSON..there are great ones here on AVVO as I have read their answers for many years!\n\nOther issues and facts can gravely affect your case so I will point those out next for you. You need and want to enjoy your fresh start also. But the most important thing is to meet with an attorney as you asking this question means you have not. You care about 2 goals: keeping everything you have equity in and discharging all your debts. If you don't have any of the exceptions to discharge you will obtain that goal; most exceptions are set forth in 11 USC. 523 (Google it) like child support, some income taxes, traffic (in a ch 7) and criminal fines , and presumption of student loans. But some debts are dischargeable in a ch 13 but NOT in a ch 7 so you want to make sure and your attorney will discuss any such types with you also and how community income and assets interrelate!\n\nYour exemptions depend on what state you have lived in in the last 2 years and thus if in your state, then your states exemptions will apply. Most persons filing keep everything they own but your attorney will confirm that with you when they learn everything you own and the equity thereof!\n\nSome secured debts like homes, vehicles, other secured debts an attorney will discuss your options on also as you must list any debts; but that does not mean you will lose them unless you have too much equity or are in default on paying for them! Discuss those options if they apply with your attorney too.\n\nBut other issues can arise that can greatly harm your case. Just one example: If you paid back a relative $3,000 11 months ago and now file bankruptcy next week, the trustee can SUE that relative to retrieve that $3,000 (under what is called a preference) for the benefit of the bankruptcy estate. As a result, most attorneys don't charge to meet with them the first meeting so meet with one no matter what.\n\nMany great attorneys can be found right here on AVVO in your state of CA so look, call, and meet one as soon as you can.\n\nYou should also want to know when to file: is there an advantage of waiting versus filing now and who should you pay between now and then! Good luck and enjoy your later fresh start.",
        "I'm not sure from your description whether the loan is pending and you still have to sign paperwork, in which case you owe LL nothing at this time, or you finalized the loan and you now owe Liberty Lending. Either way, talk to an experienced bankruptcy attorney to determine your options, and sign nothing else until you do so.",
        "Depending on your overall financial picture, chapter 7 BK might be a better alternative. Debt settlement companies are a business and you are their product. Don't sign anything until after you have consulted with a BK lawyer. Some offer a free consultation to help you sort out your options. Take them up on it. You have much at stake here.",
        "Bankruptcy is likely a better option for you. You can file for bankruptcy without your husband, but whether it effects your husband depends on whether you own property together or are on debts as co-borrowers."

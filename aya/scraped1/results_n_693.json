        "This is an extremely common practice called \"re-aging\" where the debt collector says they get to re-set the date. They do not, what they're doing is illegal, and you probably have a great case against them. I would call an attorney asap because they'll probably take it on a contingency so you don't have to pay anything out of pocket.",
        "In addition to the answer from the other attorney, I can't help but wonder whether you have been getting unlawfully harassed by this debt collector. There are powerful federal laws that govern the conduct of debt collectors and creditors, and you could be entitled to money if companies are violating collection laws. Under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (\"TCPA\"), if creditors or debt collectors are calling your cell phone using an automated system (robocalls), and the calls are made without your consent, each call could be worth $500. In addition, creditors and debt collectors are bound to comply with the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (\"FDCPA\"), and they are prohibited from harassing you with excessive calls or aggressive tactics. If debt collectors are violating the FDCPA when attempting to collect your debts, you might be entitled to up to $1,000. If you believe any collectors violated your rights, you might want to consider speaking to an experienced consumer protection attorney for advice. Most consumer protection attorneys do not charge for their services.",
        "The bill becomes delinquent as soon as the debt is past due for payment. That date has nothing to do with the date the collector received it. The debt collector is either deliberately lying, (a strong possibility) or else ignorant."

    "title": "I have an abstract of judgment recorded against me - what can I do?",
    "question": "In early 2013, I entered into a settlement and stipulation for entry of judgment in the event of default to pay my credit card debt. Per the judgment I was supposed to pay $300 for several years. After a year and a half, I missed one single month and the creditor obtained a judgment against me for the entire original amount minus what I have already paid, plus attorneys fees and costs. An abstract of judgment has been recorded against me. What is going to happen now? I barely make minimum wage and hardly have any assets. Is there anything I can do to at least delay the collection?",

        "Before thinking about a bankruptcy, there are three important things to consider.\n\nFirst, a wage garnishment enforced in California is limited to 25% of earnings. In addition, you are entitled to assert a claim of exemption if taking that 25% would impose a hardship on providing the bare necessities to yourself and your dependents. If you make minimum wage, it is likely that you would succeed in making that claim.\n\nSecond, the judgment creditor has 10 years from entry to renew the judgment, regardless of whether an abstract has been issued or recorded. Look at the original judgment for the file stamp date in the upper right hand corner or at the abstract on the middle left hand side for the date of entry of judgment. If the settlement was made in early 2003, and the judgment was entered about a year and a half afterwards, then there would be less than a year left before the judgment expires, absent the creditor applying for renewal. Not all creditors do that since that may require an additional investment of attorney fees and costs.\n\nThird, most bad credit events drop off your report within 5-10 years. Run a credit check on yourself to see if it is still there. If not, then all the more reason to lay low to see if the judgment expires without renewal.",
        "Unfortunately that's why creditors enter into these agreements, to get their judgment easily if you miss a payment. Garnishment of your checks is a possibility for whatever you earn in a week over $320 (min. wage times 40 hours) up to 25% of your disposable earnings. If you don't work full time, they may not be able to garnish.",
        "You can try working out payment arrangements with the creditor, or, if you have significant debt in relation to your income, consider consulting with a bankruptcy attorney to see if filing bankruptcy would be a good solution.",
        "The recorded Abstract of Judgment will affect your credit. Because it is a public record, the credit reporting agencies will include it on your credit report, so it may be more difficult for you to borrow money, finance a new car, etc. Also, the Abstract of Judgment will prevent you from buying any real estate which is located in the court where recorded. You will not be able to buy a home, an apartment building or a shopping center in the county where it was recorded, although you might be able to buy real estate in a neighboring county."

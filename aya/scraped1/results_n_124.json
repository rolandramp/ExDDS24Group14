    "title": "Is it free to file an adversary proceeding for a debtor in a chapter 7 bankruptcy or is there a fee?",
    "question": "Thinking about filing for a chapter 7 bankruptcy.",
    "answers": [
        "Not enough facts are known and just you asking that question implies you have NOT done the most important thing to do: Discuss in detail your bankruptcy options. It is unknown why you would even be thinking of an adversary unless it is with student loans for example (which you have no separate filing fee if you file that adversary case during your bankruptcy). But that is why a conference in person or on phone is needed. There are great attorneys in your State here on AVVO and bet you will receive some replies shortly today I am confident.\n\nYou need and want to enjoy your fresh start also. But the most important thing is to meet with an attorney as you asking this question means you have not. You care about 2 goals: keeping everything you have equity in and discharging all your debts. If you don't have any of the exceptions to discharge you will obtain that goal; most exceptions are set forth in 11 USC. 523 (Google it) like child support, some income taxes, traffic (in a ch 7) and criminal fines , and presumption of student loans. But some debts are dischargeable in a ch 13 but NOT in a ch 7 so you want to make sure and your attorney will discuss any such types with you also!\n\nYour exemptions depend on what state you have lived in in the last 2 years and thus if in your state, then your states exemptions will apply. Most persons filing keep everything they own but your attorney will confirm that with you when they learn everything you own and the equity thereof!\n\nSome secured debts like homes, vehicles, other secured debts an attorney will discuss your options on also as you must list any debts; but that does not mean you will lose them unless you have too much equity or are in default on paying for them! Discuss those options if they apply with your attorney too.\n\nBut other issues can arise that can greatly harm your case. Just one example: If you paid back a relative $3,000 11 months ago and now file bankruptcy next week, the trustee can SUE that relative to retrieve that $3,000 (under what is called a preference) for the benefit of the bankruptcy estate. As a result, most attorneys don't charge to meet with them the first meeting so meet with one no matter what.\n\nMany great attorneys can be found right here on AVVO in your state so look, call, and meet one as soon as you can.\n\nYou should also want to know when to file: is there an advantage of waiting versus filing now and who should you pay between now and then! Good luck and enjoy your later fresh start.",
        "As stated, there is a filing fee for an adversary proceeding, paid by the plaintiff (the filer). Consult directly with a bankruptcy attorney to discuss the specifics.",
        "If the debtor is the plaintiff in the Adversary Case, then the court does not charge a filing fee.",
        "Normally a creditor, not the debtor, files an adversary proceeding as the plaintiff. The court charges a filing fee [currently $350]. I don't know if the court would consider an in forma pauperis application to waive the fee. You can do that in the main Chapter 7 bankruptcy case, but there is nothing in the Local Rules about any other fee waivers.",
        "Not free - in fact, it's relatively expensive when you add in the attorney fees (for drafting and filing the complaint) the filing fee, and the service fees.\nIt's rarely done unless the creditor believes they have a good case against you for fraud or malice or ...",
        "It may well be free for the Debtor to file the Adversary. Check with the Clerk of Bankruptcy Court where your case is filed. Be advised, however, that these cases are complex. The court will expect you to follow the rules and procedures which govern Adversary complaints and bankruptcy court proceedings. This will be an overwhelming task to someone who is not a lawyer. I urge you to get a consultation from a lawyer. You can save yourself a lot of time, expense and hassle.",
        "Almost always, adversary complaints are filed by creditors against a debtor. As suggested by atty Granvold, the most common adversary complaint filed by a debtor against a creditor pertains to seeking discharge of student loans.

        "I concur with attorney Whitaker concerning your ability to do some pre-bankrupty planning. Yes, you can contribute to your IRA and do other things with the funds that would be a perfectly acceptable example of converting a non-exempt asset into an exempt asset. I would like to add however, that you should meet with an experienced local bankruptcy attorney to review your entire financial situation and all of your assets to make sure you are properly valuing your assets and using the best exemption sections available to you. If you really have to use that much of the wildcard, then it sounds like you have to stay in the 703 series of exemptions and would have no other choice than to try to reduce the amount of the non-exempt funds. However, if you can find a way to make the 704 series of exemptions work for you, and if the bank account you are referring to contains only \"paid earnings\" received by your wife, then it would be possible to exempt the full amount of that account using a couple different exemptions available under the 704 series.\n\nSo, as has been suggested by other responses already, I too would recommend you meet with a local attorney to double-check your asset valuations and exemptions and put together a game-plan for some pre-bankruptcy planning or to find other ways to exempt the funds.",
        "All community property comes into the estate of the spouse filing bankruptcy. That said, there are ways to maximize your exemptions and other planning you might be able to do. Any money you spend for a lawyer in this situation will result in just that much less being paid into the court. Do not do this Chapter 7 yourself, period.\n\nGood luck,\n\nRob",
        "Assuming you don't have a prenuptial agreement and assuming none of her savings were the result of gifts or inheritance and assuming you've been married the whole time she's been saving, her savings are community property and will go to your Ch7 Trustee to the extent you are unable to exempt them. Are you sure you need $18,000 of the wildcard already?",

        "I am reluctant to answer this question because $25,000 is at stake. You need to MEET with an experienced bankruptcy attorney AND tell him/her about your wife's bank account. I don't know if CA's community property law impacts your situation but my instinct says it does, which means she could lose half the savings account.",
        "Trustees often ask for bank statements for accounts with high balances at the time of filing. Assuming your application of the exemptions is correct, you should find a way to legitimately draw down the balance on the savings account before you file. Consult an attorney before filing."

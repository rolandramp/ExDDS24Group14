        "Involuntary Lien Notices usually come from financial institution holding your account that has been liened or County recorder.\nYes. Vehicle is vulnerable if it is security for the debt.\nYes. Call creditor to obtain information.",
        "I am not clear what you received from a credit card company. A notice of involuntary lien seems odd. Are you sure that you did not receive it from the county clerk or county recorder's office? Do you have money deposited with the same bank that you are not paying? If so, then expect them to do a banker's lien and take the overdue funds from your deposit account. They will not take the car, even if you transfer it to your name. Calling the creditor when you are not clear what the status is could be used against you, but perhaps they will settle with you. Do you have funds to settle? If not, then why would you call them? Consult an experienced debt collection DEFENSE attorney. General practitioners will not be able to provide much guidance to you.",
        "The car will not be taken. That said, you should always stay in touch with creditors. Let them know what you are doing to honor your debts.\n\nIf you don't, they assume you are a deadbeat."

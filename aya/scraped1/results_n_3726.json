    "title": "Will unpaid fines for DUI that went to collections \"fall off\" my husband's credit report and not have to be paid in 7 years?",
    "question": "My husband paid a lawyer to take care of his DUI in 2009. Years later we discover the lawyer was corrupt, stole people's money and didn't pay the fines to the court. Now, his fines have been sent to collections and are being garnished from our tax refunds. Since it has been 5 years, should we worry about hiring another lawyer to prove the fine was paid? Or should we just wait and let the collection \"fall off\" his credit report? Or will the City of San Diego always continue to garnish our tax refunds until the debt is paid? Also, he got his license reinstated without any problems, and they only started the garnishing this year.",
    "answers": [
        "Contact your local bar association first as they deal with corrupt lawyers. Then contact the credit agencies about a non-payment of a fine \"falling off\" the report. It is likely you may need to pay the fine but if the lawyer was corrupt and stole your money the State may have a fund for you to collect as a victim of his fraud.",
        "I will also ad that criminal fines are not considered consumer debt under the FDCPA. I have never heard of an attorney paying the fines for the client, but I am not in San Diego.",
        "If your husband's criminal fines were not paid to the court, the debt never goes away. Not only may a $300 civil assessment be added to the past due amount, but failure to pay criminal fines may also result in your husband being arrested for violating the terms of his probation (paying the fines as ordered). You should consult with a criminal defense attorney right away, especially if immediate action is necessary to recall an outstanding arrest warrant.. Prompt action is necessary. Do not wait.\n\nSheryl S. Graf\nAttorney at Law\n(619) 440-5716",
        "I'll see if I can answer this for you.\n\nFirst of all, you paid money to the corrupt attorney in 2009. Why didn't you make a claim against the client security fund? See link below. You knew he took your money and didn't pay the fines. So now you have to pay twice out of your tax refunds! Yikes!\n\nOkay now for the second part. Even if the fines fall off your credit report they won't go away. Fines have a notoriously long life. Some lasting forever until they are fully paid with interest and penalties.\n\nYour credit report does not release you from old debts. Old debts are still debts, even if the statute of limitations passes. The only thing that the credit bureau does is report debts that are up to 7 years delinquent or closed accounts even if they have a zero balance.\n\nThird, you should retain an attorney or at least consult with one, to address this issue so that you can settle your fines. San Diego I am sure would be forgiving to a large extent if you proved that you paid your former and now corrupt lawyer money that was meant to pay off your fines. If what you say is true, then your money was embezzled from you.\n\nIt may be too late, but you can only try.\n\nFinally, some license reinstatements are not co-dependent on payment of the fine. They are co-dependent upon undergoing whatever DUI program the court orders, and, passage of time.\n\nI sincerely hope there will be no future drinking and driving. This was certainly an expensive lesson that you guys are still paying for.",
        "But the fine wasn't paid. Deal with this proactively. Delaying and making poor decisions is what likely got your husband into this mess with his \"corrupt\" attorney in the first place!"

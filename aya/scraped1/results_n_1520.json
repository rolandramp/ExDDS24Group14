    "title": "If a purchase agreement has a personal guaranty of the performance of the contract and seller breaches can i seek damages?",
    "question": "In a business acquisition deal I executed a stock purchase agreement whereby there was a personal guarantee clause binding buyer and seller to the performance of contract..if seller breaches can buyer seek damages against seller both corporately and personally? Also it states in the agreement that seller has 3 days to request any due diligence items but seller waited till 3 days prior to closing to request this info and has been stalling. What are my options? Can seller do this? or they must close unless they want to be slapped with a breach of contract lawsuit?",

        "Generally, if one person agrees to pay the existing or potential debts or obligation of an entity, then one is said to be \"guarantying\" the debt and one becomes as liable for payment as if one had incurred the obligation directly. Under California law, if properly drafted, a guaranty is a fully enforceable obligation which allows the guaranteed party to proceed directly against the guarantor, often without having to even exhaust first any remedies against the principal. [Note that each situation is fact specific and it is impossible to evaluate a legal problem without a comprehensive consultation and review and understanding of all the relevant facts and documents and applicable law.]",
        "If an individual guaranteed the agreement in his or her personal capacity then he or she is liable for performance of the contract if the entity breaches. Have an attorney review your agreement to advise whether any material provision has been breached. Your attorney may advise you to have a letter drafted seeking clarity of the seller's intentions and informing them of their liability if they do not perform. Best of luck.",

    "title": "Can I refile my Chapter 13 if dismissed for not turning in tax return and refund",
    "question": "We filed for chapter 13 about a year and a half ago. In Southern CA as thats where we were living but our residence is in NO CA and we are back here. I didnt send in my returns or refunds for 2010 or 2011 and the trustee filed a motion to dismiss. we sent the returns and the money but wondering if the trustee will dismiss our case and if he does can we re-file in NO CA? and how soon after dismissal?",
    "answers": [
        "If your case was recently dismissed, you may be able to reinstate it by filing a motion for the court to reconsider the dismissal, especially if you complied with the Trustee requirements. If not dismissed, then contact the Trustee to confirm that s/he received your paperwork & payment.\n\nIt is much less expensive to save an existing case than to refile.\n\nHope this perspective helps!",
        "\"we sent the returns and the money\"\n\nSent returns to trustee or to IRS?\n\nYou make it sound as if you case was dismissed long ago, but as if it is still pending. Has your attorney coordinated with the trustee? What is the attorney's assessment of the trustee? You have left a lot of undefined issues. WHY was tax and refunds not submitted?",
        "The law limits how often your debts can actually be forgiven. If your case is dismissed, then your debts will be reinstated not forgiven. This means you can file another chapter 13 and include those debts as well as any new debts incurred since the filing of the prior case. Take a look at my profile, I have a legal guide discussing refiling after a prior case. I have offices in Walnut Creek, Antioch and Hercules.",
        "Yes you can refile unless there's an order barring you. However, I don't think an order would bar you for that period of time. We offer a free initial consultation just so we can make these determinations."

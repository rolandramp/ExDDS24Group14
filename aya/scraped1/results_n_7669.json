        "There ought not be any financial or legal ramifications if your friend does not have any ownership interest in your house. There isn't a legal way to prevent his usage of your address, but you could always mark each piece of mail \"return to sender- not at this address\" and give it back to the post office if you are concerned and the friend refuses to change his address.",
        "Your concerns are certainly understandable. If he is using your address notwithstanding your request to the contrary, this may be a \"red flag\" that he would use other information that could adversely affect you.\n\nAs an initial matter, I would highly encourage you to monitor your credit reports from the three national credit reporting agencies to ensure accounts are not being opened in your name, and that your credit report is not being accessed in an unauthorized manner.

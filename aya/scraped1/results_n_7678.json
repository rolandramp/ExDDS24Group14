        "Eligibility to file Chapter 7 has nothing to do with your tax returns. Eligibility to file is based on an average of what you have earned during the past 6 months & whether you have any amount of money left over to pay your debts.\n\nSo why is everyone talking about your tax returns? Because in order to complete your Chapter 7 case, the Trustee will require you to produce your tax returns so that s/he can evaluate your financial circumstances. Unless you can document that you have no legal obligation to file taxes (and don't come in with some bogus argument about being a tax protestor or being a church), no tax returns means that the trustee will ultimately ask that your Chapter 7 be dismissed for your failure to cooperate.\n\nWhat I am saying is that there is a difference between being eligible and being able to fulfill the requirements of a Chapter 7.

        "There is no requirement that you must be current on your income tax returns for filing a Chapter 7 bankruptcy. That requirement arises in Chapter 13; a Chapter 13 Plan cannot be confirmed if tax returns for the preceding four tax years have not been filed, and the returns must be filed no later than the day before the 341 hearing (this deadline can be extended by the Trustee). In both a Chapter 7 and Chapter 13 bankruptcy cases, the filer must provide the Bankruptcy Trustee with a copy of the most recently filed tax return or tax transcript at least 7 days prior to the 341 hearing, as well as any creditor who requests a copy. This can be difficult if it has been many years since a return has been filed as, if many years have passed, no return or transcript may be available. In such a case, the bankruptcy filer can submit a sworn declaration to the trustee stating that they have not filed tax returns in X number of years and that copies of prior filings are unavailable, which will normally satisfy this requirement.",

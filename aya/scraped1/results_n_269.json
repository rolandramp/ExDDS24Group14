    "title": "Why was my friend told he cannot file bankruptcy unless he has enough money to cover his living expenses for 4 months?",
    "question": "I believe he was told this by an attorney, but it doesn't sound right. Is it true? (Bankruptcy filing for an individual; Riverside County, California.)",

        "There's not enough information provided to answer. However, there's no requirement in a chapter 7 that you have money for four months to pay your expenses. In a chapter 13, you do have to show that the plan is feasible, meaning that you have enough income coming to meet your monthly expenses, in addition to your plan payment.\n\nBe very careful who you are getting your legal advice from for bankruptcy. There's a lot of new attorneys or new to bankruptcy attorneys who have NO EXPERIENCE in bankruptcy. They're just getting into it because they think it's going to be the hot new area of law in a recession. You should always interview several bankruptcy attorneys. You should NOT go to an attorney who has filed less than 1,000 cases. You should go to a Certified Bankruptcy Specialist (certified by the State Bar). You should ask for proof of how many cases the attorney has filed. You should make sure they are a member of NACBA (See nacba.org). Be careful.\n\nYou are the consumer. You have every right to interview the person you want to hire and to ask questions. If you leave the interview not understanding the process, you should either ask more questions or find someone who has the skill to explain it to you.",
        "Your friend is wrong. You can file Chapter 7 with zero income. All you need is money for the filing fee and the lawyer.",
        "Who knows? Perhaps your friend filed a Chapter 7 7 yrs, 8 months ago and can't file another for four months, thereby necessitating that he support himself in the meantime.",
        "Your friend either needs to go back to the original attorney for clarification or perhaps consult with another attorney in the area. There are some outstanding ones who are in your area and have answered this question.",
        "Hopefully, your friend misunderstood the attorney that told him this information, as there is no requirement in the bankruptcy code that an individual have \"enough money (on hand) to cover his living expenses for 4 months\". There are income requirements when determining whether one can file a bankruptcy and in determining which chapter an individual qualifies for. However, there is no minimum cash on hand requirement in filing a bankruptcy.\n\nYour friend should get a second opinion if that is really what someone is telling him. And if your friend has not spoken with an attorney, you should urge him to speak with a reputable and experienced bankruptcy attorney on this issue. Lots of us are still operating and seeing clients by phone or virtually, during these very tough times, so good advice is available any time!",
        "It wouldn't be true for any bankruptcy rules. In a chapter 13 one needs an ongoing income to complete the plan which is at least 36 months in the typical case, but for a chapter 7 discharge when there is no reason to have a 13 plan, one needs to pay a filing fee or can apply for a waiver.",
        "Will not speculate. Many reasons best friend given advice.\nBest friend should ask his attorney why \"he cannot file bankruptcy unless he has enough money to cover his living expenses for 4 months?\"",
        "Not enough information given as to why that would have been the case. But generally, for a Chapter 7, there is not such a requirement to be able to afford your expenses for the purposes of a Chapter 7 bankruptcy."

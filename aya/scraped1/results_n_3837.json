    "title": "How can I dissolve corporation and back date to 2006?",
    "question": "I have a corporation that last did any business was in 2006. Filed taxes and there has been absolutely no activity since then. I did not know I had to dissolve the corporation. It is currently in suspended status.",
    "answers": [
        "It is prohibitively expensive to dissolve back to 2006, you need to reinstate, then pay all the minim tax of $800 per year plus penalty plus interest for 2007 through 2013, then pay more to formally dissolve gain. This is why you were advised to do nothing previously. Generally the FTB will not go after a defunct corporation's owners, unless it appears from what you filed in 2006 that there was money you took as distributions and didn't pay corporate debts. Next, if you have a 1099C in your name personally this is separate from the corporation (even though it may be the same debt, you were a co debtor or guarantor), so you can use the 982 on your personal return with the personal 1099C. This is not connected to the corporate return, two separate matters. This is really a CPA question not a legal question so verify this with your CPA."

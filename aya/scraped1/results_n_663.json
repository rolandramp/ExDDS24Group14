    "title": "How can I get judgment released and removed from my record and house ?",
    "question": "in 2012 I filed for chapter 7, and all my debt including the 2 judgments in question were included in bk. Now that I'm trying to sell my house the 2 liens/judgements are still on the house and the law firm who furnished them is refusing to release the judgment and are asking for a payment in full even though these were included in my chapter 7. Am I not protected under BK code? isn't there anything I can file with court to request the release of these judgements ?",

        "You are personally forgiven of the secured and unsecured debts. Secured debts are still attached to the property it secures. If you did not file a motion to avoid the judgment lien then the lien survived the bankruptcy.\nYou can go in and reopen your case and file the motion. First you should consult with a knowledgeable bankruptcy attorney in your area to make sure you qualify for the lien avoidance.",
        "Your bankruptcy got rid of the personal liability for the debt but not the judgment liens which attached to your property. Confusing I know. You will need to file a motion to reopen your case and file a motion to avoid the liens which will necessitate an appraisal of what the property was worth when you filed the bankruptcy. Lien avoidance is highly technical. If you try to do it yourself, you will fail. Hire an experienced bankruptcy lawyer and you will spend as much or more on the lien avoidance as you did for the original bankruptcy.",
        "If you used an attorney for your chapter 7 then you should go back to him or her for the answers to your questions. When you list a creditor on your bankruptcy schedules, it results in the discharge of your personal responsibility for the debt. However, if there was a judgment entered and recorded with the county recorder, the judgment might attach to your property. If the judgments were in existence and recorded before you filed the bankruptcy, then some action should have been taken during the bankruptcy to avoid the liens. I recommend that you see a local bankruptcy attorney to review your case and properly advise you on how to fix this mess."

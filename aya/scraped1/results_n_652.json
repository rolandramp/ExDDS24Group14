    "title": "After I file Ch 7 bankruptcy, what forms do I file with civil court to stop the judgment against me that's not yet finalized?",
    "question": "Sued for 17k medical debt, judgment not finalized... Filing Ch 7 bankruptcy to stop it and start over as I have so much medical debt. What forms do I file with civil court right after I file Ch 7 to stop the judgment? I've filed Ch 7 before but not to so a judgment and possible wage garnishment. I'm proficient with court forms and filing but I've never been in this situation and I want to get it right. Also, when the judgment is stopped, does that mean it gets cleared off my credit (or prevents it from going on my credit) and goes away? If it's already on my credit, who removes it?",

        "I'll take a shot at answering the rest of your questions. If 30 days since you were sued have run, the time it takes for the judgment creditor to seek a default judgment, then it all depends on both the judgment creditor's attorney and the court. Some attorneys are johnny-on-the-spot, and seek a Request for entry of default as soon as possible. Some wait a week, as some judges are more lax and will allow a pro se debtor (one without an attorney) to answer even after the creditor has rightfully sought a default. That doesn't please creditors' attorneys, but it makes some judges feel real good about themselves. Most delays are caused by large backlogs of cases, and the priority is not necessarily on default civil judgments.\nIt is almost always wise to get your case filed well before the statutory 30 day period has run, but there are major exceptions. If you expect more major medical bills, do not file your bankruptcy yet! You will only discharge past bills, but not future bills! This is how good attorneys pay many times over for their good advice. I have withheld filing for many months, and longer, to be sure the debtor is not saddled with overwhelming debt after filing a bankruptcy. I tell the story of a fellow attorney's client who suffered a heart attack at the 341 meeting of Creditors, after the case was filed. It was a no-asset case, and the case could have been dismissed since the debtor was placed in a surgery unit that very day. however, the attorney let the client talk him out of ending the meeting, and the meeting was concluded. The surgery that night and resultant follow-up costs from the heart attack left the poor debtor $37,000 in debt (this is obviously an old story..the total would be much higher today) AFTER his Chapter 7 was discharged! He should have listened to his attorney and the attorney should have been more forceful, taking a \"time-out\" from the meeting to allow his client to be examined by the nurse down the hall. She would've insisted on stopping the meeting of creditors to allow the debtor to go to the hospital.\n\nWould have, could have, should have. This story should give pause to you as you consider your circumstances!!! There are equally good reasons to seek the counsel and services of a very well-reviewed and accomplished attorney here on AVVO. Use the Find an Attorney function for Stanislaus County, or Modesto. That is where you will go to court!\n\nYour other two questions are really one question. If the judgment has already been granted, then it is too late to stop it from going the way of many judgments. However, it still may not end up on your credit report. Here is a link to an article on the movement by credit reporting agencies (CRAs) to stop reporting some judgments and liens from being reported. This is a relatively new development:\nhttps://www.creditkarma.com/advice/i/credit-score-increase-removal-tax-liens.\n\nMy final suggestion is to avoid being a victim. Get ahead of this matter by seeking an experienced attorney's advice immediately. Most do not charge for a first consultation! Just be sure that you will be talking to the actual attorney and not to his/her paralegal. Talking to a paralegal should be free.

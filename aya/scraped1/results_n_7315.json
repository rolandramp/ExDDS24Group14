    "title": "When exactly does the statute of limitations start on a second mortgage debt in California?",
    "question": "I owned a condo that that sold at an auction 6/08. The last payment we made was 9/07. I received a letter from a collections agency last year (2010) in the amount of $102,000 due to a refinanced second mortgage and was planning to file bankruptcy but haven't yet (my husband just started working again last month after 2.5 yrs of unemployment). It's now 1/12 and I think the SOL is up, unless it starts as of the foreclosure date? My question is, does the SOL on a mortgage debt collection start after your last payment or after the foreclosure date? It's the difference between me filing BK and not. Thanks!",

        "Your debt, if any remains, is contractual.\n\nI practice in MO, a recourse deficiency state & the contractual obligation would survive.",
        "The Stat of Limitations is 4 years, starting on the date when the last payment was made. Since the holder of the second mortgage sold the property at a foreclosure auction, it received something out of the sale proceedings. I am assuming that the foreclosure was done by the holder of the 2nd TD. The proceeds of that sale would be credited towards the total amount owing on the debt, and the Stat of Limitations would start at that point. Since you are within 5 months of the running of the Statute of Limitations, I would not pay a penny, as any payment would re-state the Stat of Lims. I would wait to see whether they actually file suit before the Statute runs out. If they do file, you can evaluate whether BK is appropriate at that time."

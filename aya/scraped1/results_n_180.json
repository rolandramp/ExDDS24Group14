        "It really depends on a number of factors some being how much debt is in your name, how much debt is in her name, and how many co-signor accounts do you have together? Why was your chapter 7 bankruptcy dismissed? Do you have a family lawyer? What assets do you have and what assets does she have? There are a number of things to go over to determine the proper bankruptcy chapter and to determine the proper timing of filing your bankruptcy. I recommend to schedule a phone consultation with one of the many good bankruptcy lawyers here on AVVO.",
        "One thing that could also be a problem is why your most recent Ch7 was dismissed. You should take whatever paperwork related to the dismissal to the attorney you retain to assist you with your new filing. In certain circumstances, debts that were included in a ch7 that was dismissed rather than discharged are not dischargeable in a subsequent bankruptcy so why your case was dismissed may be very important.",
        "It depends on how much community debt there is and if your wife is willing to file a joint BK. Talk to a local BK lawyer.",
        "If you and your soon to be ex can tolerate each other for a few more weeks, file jointly. It's cheaper and it will take division of the debts off the property settlement table.",
        "The answer to your question depends on how much of your debt is community debt and how you imagine your divorce will apportion that debt.\nIt simply may not be possible; but the best option is to file bankruptcy jointly with your spouse to eliminate all the debt so it doesn't have to be apportioned in the divorce.\nFailing that, you need to understand that any community debt with your spouse's name on the debt may not be dischargeable if you take on this debt in the divorce and then try to eliminate it in a BK."

        "The bankruptcy can be filed just in your name, or together with your partner if you choose. If you are the only one filing, your partner is not involved in the case and it should have no effect. Of course, if the partner co-signed any of the debts, the creditor will collect from the partner for anything you do not pay. Finally, the whole household income needs to be listed on your paperwork including your partner's income and bills. Their name will not be listed, but the employment details will.",
        "It won't - assuming you are the only one on the loan.\nYour partner's social security number will not be involved with your BK.",
        "You filing an individual case should not effect your partner. The social security number is used on bankruptcy paperwork to identify who you are and credit reporting agencies use social security numbers to report information. So if your partner's social is not used on your bankruptcy paperwork then it should not negatively impact your partner. That is one of the reasons why they have individual or joint filing options in bankruptcy. I hope this helps. Best of luck!",
        "I'll make one correction, you can file jointly if you are married. You may not file a joint petition if you are registered domestic partners. Federal law requires marriage. California's registered domestic partner laws do not equate to marriage for the purpose of filing for bankruptcy protection. However, the means test does require that you disclose all household income. DP laws treat income the same as if it was earned as community property. So, while your partner's income is not affected by the bankruptcy filing, it may impact whether or not you pass the means test. You really need to meet with a qualified bankruptcy attorney who is familiar with DP laws and bankruptcy in the Central District of California. There are many attorneys, but not all are qualified. Be careful."

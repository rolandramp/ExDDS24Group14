        "I agree with my colleagues but wish to point out a trap for the unwary. There is fine print in some auto finance contracts which permit the auto lender to unwind the loan if you file for bankruptcy within thirty days of purchasing a car. This happened to a client of mine who like you had a high mileage car that he needed to replace and wanted to do it before he filed for bankruptcy. He was able to secure alternate financing, but it was at a higher rate. Read your loan docs carefully!",
        "I completely agree with Mr. Salanick on the numerous pitfalls you can encounter if you purchase a car soon before filing a Chapter 7. Nearly all of the issues outlined by Mr. Salanick will only arise if you finance the purchase of the vehicle (only exemption from liquidation issues will arise if you purchase the vehicle for cash or without financing).\n\nI have had multiple clients purchase a new vehicle (with financing) within as little as 2 weeks prior to filing a Chapter 7. However, in every instance, the debtor was is legitimate need of a new vehicle. If you do elect to purchase a new car via financing, make sure you have an honest and verifiable reason as to why you incurred new debt when you knew you were going to be filing bankruptcy shortly thereafter.\n\nOne other issues that hasn't been mentioned is: when you finance the purchase of a vehicle, the lender has to perfect/record their lien against the vehicle in order to secure their debt. Many lenders in this arena do not record their liens in a very timely manner (potentially more than a month after you drive away in the financed vehicle). Therefore, if you purchase your vehicle with financing and then file your Chapter 7 the next day or even week, you may have placed an asset into the bankruptcy estate that is free and clear of any liens and that may be unexempt from liquidation. In other words, the person administering your bankruptcy case will take the vehicle from you, sell it, and repay your creditors from the proceeds. You might end up with no new vehicle and the auto lender coming into your bankruptcy seeking non-dischargeability of this debt.\n\nBefore making any decision like this, it is IMPERATIVE that you speak with your bankruptcy attorney. If you don't have one, get one now. If your existing attorney doesn't advise you of all the various issues outlined in these answers, consider getting one who does.\n\nGood luck!",
        "Supreme Court's Opinion in Ransom v FIA Card holds that if there is no lien financing or lease expense associated with a vehicle, then you do NOT get an ownership expense amount as part of your budget of expenses, and you would only get an operation expense. So, acquiring and financing or leasing a vehicle prior to filing would give you an additional Form B22 Means Test expense for ownership expenses in addition to an operating expense deduction. If a car is needed to get to work, and the old car may not permit you to earn the income to repay your debts, then there is a reasonable explanation for incurring a new financing/lease expense immediately prior to filing.\n\nThis response is not legal advice and does not create an attorney-client relationship between you and my office. I am not your attorney and you are not my client. You cannot rely on my response to your question. This response is intended only for general informational purposes and should be used only as a starting point for addressing your legal issues.",
        "It often makes sense to make a purchase before filing, as it may be more difficult after you file. When it comes to secured debt in a Chapter 7, you will have three options.

You may redeem the debt; meaning you pay the value of the asset, rather than what you owe on the asset.

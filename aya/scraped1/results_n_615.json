    "title": "I took out a loan with the company Loanme. I am unable to pay it back, can they garnish my wages. Im an independant contractor?",
    "question": "Things changed drastically for me financially and I’m unable to repay this loan. I issued a stop payment with my bank and am canceling my debit card to prevent payments, I am considering bankruptcy but I recall checking something on the loan application that said something about me having no intent to file bankruptcy in the next 12 months. I had no intent when I checked the box. I’m worried I will get my wages garnished, but I’m an independant contractor. I work for Uber/Lyft, and a few others. They have a bank statement that shows my deposits and from which companies. Can they garnish my wages from these companies? Will the bankruptcy option help me?",

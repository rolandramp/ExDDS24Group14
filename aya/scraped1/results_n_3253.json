    "title": "Can the State Board of Equalization levy my bank acct for my husband's business's debt in a community property state?",
    "question": "The BOE placed a levy on my personal bank acct for a bill owed by my husband's business claiming community property. We have always kept our assets and debts separate (never co-mingled finances). He owned his business before we married and I have never been on the business license or the resale license. His name is not on my bank accts and we have no joint accounts. When I called the BOE they told me that they could not discuss the debt or negotiate with me because I am not on the resale license. This is crazy to me, that they can take my money for a debt claiming I am responsible due to Community Property, then turn around and say I don't have access to info about the debt. I thought we could agree to have community property become sole property (transmutation?) in California?",

        "Unfortunately, it is probably lawful for them to levy your account. Typically, debt incurred by one spouse during marriage can be collected from the earnings of the other spouse. It sounds like the debt was incurred (by your husband) during marriage, so although it is only in his name it is probably community debt. Similarly, your earnings during marriage are community property even though the paycheck, and corresponding bank account is only in your name.\nAs far as transmutation, I suppose in theory I can understand what your getting at, but you may lose that one because the creditor would make a fraudulent transfer argument....your husband transferred (a form of a transfer), with the intent to \"hinder, delay or defraud creditors,\" as the debt was already existing at the time of any transmutation. Also, it would be an extensive litigation process to even get to the point of making the argument to a judge.\nYou and your husband might consider trying to settle with them on a reasonable payment plan. My office has successfully settled these types of debts with FTB and BOE in the past, and I would certainly be happy to discuss it with you further. Please feel free to call my office anytime.\nBest of Luck."

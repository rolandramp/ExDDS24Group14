    "title": "If you don't pay for a $350 civil claim, will they re-demand for more?",
    "question": "I recently made a stupid mistake and shoplifted 36 dollars worth of merchandise from Urban outfitters and they caught me and took my information down. I received a civil claim for $350 dollars and don't know if I should pay. It was definitely not worth 350 dollar and I heard they only send the letter to scare you into paying them. If I don't pay though, will they send me another civil claim for more money or even worse, sue?",

        "They can always try to demand more but that really doesnt mean much. I generally advise clients to ignore these civil demand letters. You don't owe them anything. In order for you to owe them something they would have to sue you, (in some jurisdictions prove damages which they most likely couldn't do), and win. Even if they could win, the cost of pursuing this is substantially greater than any amount they can possibly recover so they usually don't. They send out these letters because it doesn't cost much and they are hoping that you don't know better and simply send them the money. Nothing will happen to you if you don't pay it. Take a look at an article in the Wall Street Journal at the link provided below.",
        "A civil demand is not a debt and you would only have to pay it if they successfully sued you. The likelihood of that happening is extremely small.\n\nIf you ignore the civil demand, you might receive another one, but you can continue to ignore them.\n\nPaying or not paying the civil demand will have no effect on any criminal actions which might be brought against you.",
        "As a rule, I advise clients to ignore these civil demand letters. Unless you signed some agreement to pay this store, you owe them nothing. In order for you to owe them something they would have to sue you and win. However, It would cost them much more to sue you than they can ever hope to recover so they usually don’t pursue it.\n\nWith that in mind, I would advise that they can still take legal action against you by filing suit in small claims court. If you ignore these actions, a default judgment will be entered against you. So, although you can ignore the civil demand letter, do not ignore anything that comes from a court.",
        "They can send another letter, sure, but one thing they cannot do is enforce it. Unless you are ordered by a judge to pay restitution to a company, it is not a valid debt. These companies often have lawyers send what are called civil demand letters to people but these are not ordered by the court and they are not valid debts (see above.) They also may not threaten criminal prosecution for failure to comply (pay).",
        "It's always possible to ignore a CIVIL demand letter without consequences.

And if you look at the many, many similar Avvo questions about this, no one advised anyone to ever pay these lawyers because they're just not going to spend their time suing anyone for a couple hundred dollars. They may send progressively hastier letters, but don't respond. They'll eventually stop.\n\nBut never shoplift again.

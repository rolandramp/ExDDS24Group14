    "title": "Past tenant files for bankruptcy before I could file a claim",
    "question": "I had a hoarder tenant that caused $25,000+ damage to my single-family house, even after insurance paid a claim. The tenant's negligence to properly cap off a fridge water line caused a water leak in the house, which with an extreme pet urine issue, caused a complete remediation and renovation of much of the house.",

        "I agree with all 3 answers. I do suggest you keep all receipts so you can offset against income on tax returns for both now in into the future. It may also be hard to prove WHO in fact caused any specific injury, i.e. the debtor, or spouse, or kids, or visitors, etc..so absent some real proof of cause of wilful and malicious injury, I would not waste money on attorney fees. Never fun having to clean up and start fresh with rental..been there and done it too with cats urine in my rented condos!",
        "I have no idea what you mean when you say that you received a \"notice that she is in the process of filing for bankruptcy.\" If you received a form 309 from the court, the tenant has filed bankruptcy. Anything else is just a worthless piece of paper. Hope this perspective helps!",
        "Maybe, but you would have to show she intentionally vandalized the property. Did you make a claim under your insurance for \"vandalism\"?",
        "I don't think your claim fist any of the exceptions to bankruptcy. It looks like you are out of luck."

    "title": "Is a month-to-month housing rental/lease an \"Unexpired lease\"?",
    "question": "I'm filing for chapter 7 soon and i notice that in the schedule g it asks to list unexpired leases. the only lease i have is a month to month lease i have with my landlord. i read online that if i had a year long rental lease, thats unexpired, but im unsure about month to month.",

        "A month to month rental contract is not an unexpired lease. Does not need to be listed on schedule G.",
        "I respectfully submit that all of the previous answers have merit, but you DO NOT want the US Trustee to think that you are withholding information.\n\nYou will meet with the trustee about 1 month after you file your petition. The trustee will see that you are not paying a mortgage, but that you are not asserting a homestead for a house. This leads to the question \"are you renting? This leads to the question, \"How much is your rent?\" This leads to the question, \"do you have a lease?\"\n\nAs a PRACTICAL matter, you should likely state somewhere, such as in \"other financial accounts,\" that you have a month to month, that you are current, and that you pay $X. You and your attorney can advise the trustee that the landlord is not listed as a creditor because you are current on your lease. The trustee may instruct you to serve the landlord, or s/he may not. And if yours is a \"no asset\" case, the court may be satisfied that failure to notify does not justify re-opening the case (as long as you are not defying an order of the trustee).\n\nDEFINITELY retain counsel. It is always better to err on the side of giving the trustee \"too much\" information, as opposed to appearing to withhold information.\n\nGOOD LUCK!!",
        "I completely disagree with the other answers. If you are on a month to month rental agreement you do not have to list your landlord because the second you pay the rent, you do not owe the land lord any money, and therefore, there is no debt. So long as you are current on your rent, you do not have to worry about an unexpired lease, nor is your land lord a creditor. I have been practicing bankruptcy law for over 28 years, and this has never been an issue under these exact circumstances.\n\nAll that being said, I agree that you really do need to hire your own attorney.",
        "I concur with the opinions above. You should have a consultation with an attorney about filing your case. Most will give a free one. There are many pitfalls to filing bankruptcy and you don't want to make a mistake that could haunt you for years. It is far cheaper to do it right then to have to fix things when they go sideways.",
        "If you have signed a lease and the end date has not occurred, it is not month to month even though you pay monthly. It has to be listed and the land lord has to be given notice. Having said that, filing bankruptcy is not a breach of the lease unless it says so in the lease, and even then it may not be enforceable. Landlords rarely, if ever, kick out tenants who pay on time and don't create problems for the landlord or other tenants. Hire a lawyer. BK is not a DIY project.",
        "First, you are not using an attorney which is a mistake and could cost you down the road I will point out later.\n\nSecond, month to month is a lease..you must list it and any other contracts is the law,.\n\nThird, all landlords like creditors get notice. Just tell them you want to keep renting and law required you to list them and that they will get a notice but that you are NOT moving out and skipping out on them. If I were them I would enter into a new contact 1 day after you file. Why? Because the present contact is dischargeable. Now reasons to get an attorney follow in case it helps..Good luck .\n\nYou need and want to enjoy your fresh start also. But the most important thing is to meet with an attorney as you asking this question means you have not. You care about 2 goals: keeping everything you have equity in and discharging all your debts. If you don't have any of the exceptions to discharge you will obtain that goal; most exceptions are set forth in 11 USC. 523 (Google it) like child support, some income taxes, traffic (in a ch 7) and criminal fines , and presumption of student loans. But some debts are dischargeable in a ch 13 but NOT in a ch 7 so you want to make sure and your attorney will discuss any such types with you also!\n\nYour exemptions depend on what state you have lived in in the last 2 years and thus if in your state, then your states exemptions will apply. Most persons filing keep everything they own but your attorney will confirm that with you when they learn everything you own and the equity thereof!\n\nSome secured debts like homes, vehicles, other secured debts an attorney will discuss your options on also as you must list any debts; but that does not mean you will lose them unless you have too much equity or are in default on paying for them! Discuss those options if they apply with your attorney too.\n\nBut other issues can arise that can greatly harm your case. Just one example: If you paid back a relative $3,000 11 months ago and now file bankruptcy next week, the trustee can SUE that relative to retrieve that $3,000 (under what is called a preference) for the benefit of the bankruptcy estate. As a result, most attorneys don't charge to meet with them the first meeting so meet with one no matter what.\n\nMany great attorneys can be found right here on AVVO in your state so look, call, and meet one as soon as you can.\n\nYou should also want to know when to file: is there an advantage of waiting versus filing now and who should you pay between now and then! Good luck and enjoy your later fresh start."

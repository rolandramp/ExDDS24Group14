        "You can check the court register to see if a complaint has been filed. It is possible that a complaint has been filed, but not yet served.\n\nDebt collectors are not allowed to make idle threats. The collector's comment that they 'have enough evidence to proceed to court\" could be construed as threatening legal action, and providing a case number could be interpreted as implying that a complaint has already been filed. If neither is true, the collector may have violated the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and the Rosenthal Act (California's equivalent to the federal law). Nor is the collector allowed to falsely imply that you have committed a crime.\n\nIt is worth noting that a debt collector is required to provide you with a written notice containing information about the debt, including:\n- the amount of the debt\n- the name of the creditor to whom the debt is owed\n- the debt will be presumed valid unless the debt, or any portion thereof, is disputed within 30 days of receiving the notice\n- if the consumer notifies the collector in writing within 30 days that the debt, or any portion thereof, is disputed, the collector will mail verification of the debt to the consumer\n- if requested in writing by the consumer within 30 days of the consumer's receipt of the 1692g notice, the collector will provide the consumer with the name and address of the original creditor (if different than the current creditor).\n\nThis notice must be sent to you within five days of the collector's initial communication with you.",
        "In order for a criminal case to be filed, the police (or other law enforcement) must prepare a report and submit the case to the District Attorney. The DA will decide whether or not to file. Unless you did something like forge some else's name to a check, or printed up bogus checks, it is not a criminal matter. If there were a police investigation, the cops would contact you, not a debt collector.\n\nAs far as going to court in a civil case, in which the creditor is attempting to obtain a civil money judgment, the case must be filed with the court and it must be filed by an attorney who is licensed to practice in California. A process server (who is licensed as a process server) or a Sheriff can hand you papers including a \"Summons.\" The summons will tell you that you have 30 days to file your papers with the court. If you ignore the Summons, they can get a default judgment entered by the clerk. If you file an Answer in the civil lawsuit, the case will be set for trial. The trial date may be a year away. They would need to bring witnesses to court (an attorney cannot testify as a witness), along with some original documents. They would need to prove everything they claim. You will have an opportunity to testify.\n\nPayday lenders rarely sue, especially if the amount is less than a couple of thousand dollars. They would need to pay the court filing fee, the process server's fee, and other expenses. They would need an attorney, who is licensed to practice law in California.

A civil judgment is not a court order, requiring you to pay anything. If you have a large bank account, own any airplanes or yachts, own apartment buildings or shopping centers, or have luxury items such as a Ferrari, you can worry.

If the collector wants payment in the form of a Walmart card, moneygram or access to your bank account, it is a scam. Be careful because some of these collectors do not actually own the accounts that they claim to be collecting.

        "Avvo attorneys are really smart and really caring, but we can't read minds and have no crystal ball.\n\nWhy offer more than the attorney's fee and costs needed to file the bankruptcy?\n\nBest wishes for a favorable outcome, and please remember to designate a best answer.",
        "You can evaluate whether a motion for vacating judgment could work.",
        "Will the attorney contest the dischargeability of the debt? If there is no legal basis to do so – no. If, on the other hand, the judgment is for fraud or there is some other basis to contest your discharge – probably yes. If the judgment is just your standard run of the mill judgment for money it will be discharged in your BK.\n\nWhether or not the judgment is dischargeable you should get 100% of your money back provided it is 100% exempt. It may take awhile because of the levy. I understand this is a very recent levy and the bank many not have transferred any money to the levying officer. Your lawyer, who is familiar with your financial circumstances and the facts, is the one to advise you."

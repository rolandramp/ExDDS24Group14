        "A chapter 13 bankruptcy is very complex. There are many layers of rules to follow and the amount of preparation and thoroughness of that preparation can make all the difference between a successful chapter 13 case and a dismissed chapter 13 case. I strongly suggest you hire a bankruptcy attorney to help you prepare your bankruptcy case and represent you during your bankruptcy case. Typically, there is much more to a chapter 13 bankruptcy than just the petition packet. You can find many excellent bankruptcy attorneys here on AVVO.",
        "Filing a chapter 13 can happen in two ways, (1) either a complete filing of all petition schedules and forms documents altogether or (2) an emergency filing where critical documents are filed including your voluntary petition, complete list of creditors, etc. and with all remaining documents required to be fined within 14 days of your filing date.\n\nIn an emergency filing scenario, depending on the law firm you enlist to help you, it should take no longer than 24-48 hours to file an emergency case (possibly shorter). If filing your complete set of petition schedules and forms, anticipate longer time for preparation and review and finalization before ready to file ... perhaps 5-7+ days.\n\nAlso, be prepared to take your required credit counseling course to receive your pre-bankruptcy counseling certificate which must also be filed with your initial set of documents. Your social security number declaration will also be needed at the initial filing, whether emergency or complete petition.\n\nIf you are serious about this course with chapter 13 Bankruptcy, you would be wisest to contact a few experienced bankruptcy lawyers as soon as possible to learn more about what you will need for them to help prepare your case.\n\nBest of luck",

        "That's actually a rather complex question . Your case can generally be e-filed so that the actual filing can occur same day, provided you have completed the required credit counseling. It may, however, be better to hold off filing as taxes and secured debts such as an auto loan can receive a lesser treatment if certain time frames have run before filing. The amount you pay on a monthly basis depends upon the type of debt (unsecured, secured, auto loan, taxes, etc.) and the amount of your monthly disposable income.

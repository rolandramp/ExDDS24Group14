    "title": "I am trying to pay my commercial property mortgage & the lender is refusing payment & wants to foreclose, can I sue them?",
    "question": "I took out a property Loan for my business, got cancer &was very sick. The business failed, but family is helping me by paying my mortgage, till I can get my new business increased & profitable. The bank says I am in default because I changed the type of business and they want to foreclose (& likely buy it themselves to make a bigger profit, because the building is worth much more than owed on it). I told them I can't refinance to cash them out until I can show enough income and can resolve other issue. At first the bank told me they would give me one to two years to become profitable, if I continued to make timely payments. However, since that time they decided they would not accept my mortgage payments, started sending me a refund check every month, and have filed for a default. They know I have been very ill and need time but just don't care. They want all the money owed or to own my property in the forced foreclosure sale, instead of being satisfied receiving monthly payments I have diligently paid them. Also, I don't think Bankruptcy is feasible method, so does anyone know about commercial loan foreclosures and how to stop the bank through a lawsuit .",

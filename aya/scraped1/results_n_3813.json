        "Great question. I am not a California attorney, but in general your issue has to do with your right of subrogation as guarantor. I suggest you consult with a California commercial litigator to see what the loan documents provide and in particular whether they purport to provide a waiver of the right of subrogation, and if so whether that right is indeed waivable under California law.\n\nIf you do not have a California attorney, I would be happy to make a referral."

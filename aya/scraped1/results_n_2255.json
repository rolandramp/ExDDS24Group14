        "Whether you can file bankruptcy is an entirely different question than whether or not the debt to EDD can be discharged (eliminated) by the bankruptcy. Bankruptcy has eligibility requirements and not everyone is eligible. The links below are to info that I think may help you for next time. Hope this perspective helps!",
        "The EDD debt usually contains penalties and interest in addition to the pure tax. Depending on the specific facts in your case, and the type of bankruptcy case you file (7 or 13) you may be able to discharge a large part of the EDD debt. Either type of BK will stop collection efforts like wage and bank account levies. BK is not a DIY project. Contact an experienced BK lawyer. Many of us offer a free case analysis. Many times, a visit to the lawyer's office is not necessary and information can be communicated by telephone, email, fax and US Mail.",
        "Bankruptcy will discharge certain EDD obligations but you should consult an attorney to see 1) if you qualify for filing BK and 2) if the obligation you have is dischargeable."

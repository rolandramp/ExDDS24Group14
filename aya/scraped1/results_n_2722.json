        "No, but if he receives any means-test public benefits, you will be responsible.",
        "As a joint sponsor, you are agreeing to use your resources to support your son-in-law, if it becomes necessary. If your son-in-law receives a Federal, State, or local means-tested public benefit, the agency providing the benefit may request that you repay the cost of those benefits. These benefits generally include Food Stamps, Medicaid, Supplemental Security Income (SSI), or Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF). For immigration purposes, being a joint sponsor, in and of itself, would not make you liable for debts your son-in-law incurs."

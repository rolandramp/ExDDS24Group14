    "question": "And if so, is there a cost to amending a closed bankruptcy case or are there any other options?",
    "answers": [
        "No, a closed case cannot be amended. You can file a motion to reopen your case and amend it thereafter, but what amendments are you planning? I strongly recommend consulting a bankruptcy attorney before you try anything by yourself.",
        "You said in some of your comments that you need to add an item that is fairly new. If you mean you want to include as a debt to be discharged a debt that you incurred AFTER the time you filed your petition with the bankruptcy court, sorry, you cannot add a post-petition debt to your case and have that debt discharged. NO IFS, ANDS, or BUTS about it. Not allowed.",
        "It costs $260 to file a motion to reopen. Legal fees would be extra. A closed case can't an amended. I hope that this perspective helps!",
        "You first have to file a motion to reopen your case. The court filing fee for that is $260, You should consult with a bankruptcy attorney to see whether an amendment is even necessary. Depending on what it is, it might be. For example, if you left out a creditor from a no-asset Chapter 7 case, the debt would still be discharged so long as it was not incurred by fraud and was otherwise a dischargeable debt.",
        "You can reopen a closed case, and thereafter amend the schedules. But it may not be necessary for you to do so. You don't mention in your question why you are considering taking such action."

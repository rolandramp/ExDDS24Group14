        "The Petitioner's Request for Default Setting resulted in the Court's setting the case for Trial - Default prove up. If you are the Petitioner, you should appear at the Trial - Default prove-up hearing to testify regarding the issues in your divorce case as requested by the Judge, and to answer the Judge's questions. Come prepared with at least 2 original Judgments and quadruplicate Notice of Entry of Judgments already filled out, as well as addressed, stamped envelopes to you and your spouse, and a large self-addressed stamped envelope for the Court to return a conformed copy of the Judgment to you in. If you are the Respondent, you can come to the hearing, but you may not be allowed to testify because you didn't respond to the Petition and your default was evidently entered.",
        "It appears that you are the Petitioner and that the Respondent never filed a Response. So now, the Petitioner must set the case for hearing in order for the Court to ascertain whether your proposal for Judgment is fair and equitable, such as division of assets and debts between the parties, or for visitation if you have children, etc. The law is very clear in that both parties are entitled to half the assets accumulated during the marriage, but the debts are not necessarily divided evenly between the two spouses. It depends how much income each spouse was bringing into the household and how the debts were incurred. If one spouse just used credit cards for the sake of spending money while the other spouse was paying and paying for the debt, then the debt may be the responsibility of the \"spending\" spouse. You as the petitioner will need to prove that the Judgment you are proposing is just and fair.",
        "That means you have a hearing and at that hearing, the court will ask you to prove why the Judgment you have proposed, should be acceptable to the court as a fair an equitable division of property and support issues. Good luck!"

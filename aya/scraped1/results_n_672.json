    "title": "How do I handle medical debt that is almost six years old and was just added as a deragatory mark to my credit report?",
    "question": "A collection agency reported an old medical bill in my name to all three of my credit bureaus at the end of April without even contacting me first. This was actually husband’s doctor appointment and bill but I was the one that provided our medical insurance through my employer. This bill is almost 6 years old. The last payment made on it was a $10 co-pay made during his doctor appointment in September 2012. We lived in Las Vegas at the time but now we live in California. My husband passed away 9 months ago.",

        "DEBT VALIDATION: Whenever a consumer is contacted by a debt collector, he may make a request for \"debt validation.\" The best way to do that is to send the debt collector a letter via USPS Certified Mail. The letter should request validation of the debt and documentation of the amount that the debt collector claims that you owe. The debt collector must respond within 30 days and provide the account information and any documentation that it has. If the debt collector does not respond, it will have violated the fair debt collection statutes.\n\nIf you do receive debt validation information, and you still do not recognize the debt, you can dispute the debt in writing. If you dispute the debt, do not pay any amount, or agree to pay any amount. If you are sued, contact a debt collection defense attorney right away.\n\nThe question raises the possibility that someone fraudulently used your identity to open an account. In order to figure out whether ID theft has occurred, start by getting credit reports from the 3 major credit reporting agencies. Examine the credit reports for any debts that you do not recognize. If you believe that you are the victim of ID theft, contact a consumer attorney or debt collection defense attorney in your area.\n\nYes, you should reach out to a debt collection DEFENSE attorney. They get paid by creditors who aren't acting lawfully.",
        "My condolences on your family's loss. If this is a collection account, the debt may be reported for 7.5 years from date of first delinquency, under the Fair Credit Reporting Act. That is known as the period of obsolescence, under the FCRA. A phone call to the collection agency will not revive the statute of limitations, but if you state in writing an agreement to pay the debt or the debtor makes a payment now, the collection agency may try to claim that you have revived the time period. If your family had a trust or probate for your late husband's estate, consult with that attorney for communicating with this unpaid creditor, as it should have been dealt with in the probate/trust administration. The California four-year statute of limitations period might not apply, as this was a debt incurred in Nevada and I am not able to state what the limitations period is under the laws of Nevada. Consult a consumer protection attorney who is licensed in Nevada. You can find such lawyers on Avvo or who are members of the National Association of Consumer Advocates.",
        "In California, a person is responsible for certain types of debts incurred by his or her spouse. If you agree that there is an outstanding amount due to that medical provider, there is no reason to dispute the debt. Contacting the creditor or requesting debt validation has no real impact on whether the debt is actually owed or whether the creditor files a lawsuit to collect it. The bottom-line is that the debt is probably too old to result in a lawsuit. The statute of limitations requires the lawsuit to be filed within four years of the default or last payment made. The debt can be reported to credit reporting agencies for up to seven years from the default. So if there is no settlement you are likely to have the debt on credit reports until next year. If you settle the debt, the status on credit reports would change to \"paid\" or \"settled\" which will help your credit. However, the creditor can continue to report the delinquency until it is seven years old (2019)."

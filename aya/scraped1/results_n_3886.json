    "title": "Do I risk Chase to reposes my car if I do not reaffirm debt for car loan through bankruptcy?",
    "question": "My car loan is with Chase. I am up to date on my payments and want to keep the vehicle. Do I have to reaffirm if I want to keep it? I live in California. I dont have an attorney so if I reaffirm I will have to go to a hearing to have judge approve. What if I do not have reaffirm but want to keep and continue paying until paid off.",
    "answers": [
        "What you do not indicate is what is the real value of the vehicle? look on autotrader and see what 20 other similar vehicles actually sell for by private persons. Then you do not indicate what the amount owed on the vehicle is. Why are those important? I doubt any judge will approve any reaffirmation no matter how bad you want it if it is worth several thousand or more less than the value of that vehicle so you are wasting your time. What I would suggest, is if higher end, save the monies from not paying them , and if not yet filed, file at time 2nd payment is due, then use the vehicle for months after filing until they ever repossess it. Then take that money and use to pay for a used vehicle, start over and save the interest you would be losing on making a higher end car payment. Almost no attorney reaffirm very often on the vehicle cases. Why? Most creditors do NOT come and repossess them if you are current and if they do you are not out any money if no equity. If your engine breaks, transmission, someone T-bones you in intersection 3 months later and you have no gap insurance, the creditor will simply repossess the vehicle, sell it and then SUE YOU FOR deficiency post bankruptcy if you reaffirmed..if you did not, they cant! Simple as that. If you did reaffirm or tried, rescind it! Follow the directions in it if you fail to follow our advice and then change your mind!",
        "The only way to make sure that you can keep your car is to reaffirm the debt. Having said that, it is most often not a good idea from a financial perspective unless you have equity in your car and you are trying to protect the equity. We here in CA are very dependent on cars for our lives and if your filing for bankruptcy getting a different car is probably something that you may not be able to do, so it might be something that you feel is necessary to do. But, like the other attorneys mentioned, there are many financial risks involved with reaffirming the debt. A normal strategy is to not reaffirm and keep the payments current, but that too has risks of Chase wanting to take the car. It is not an easy decision to make and it would be best to at least meet with a lawyer to discuss confidentially.",
        "Additionally, you likely will not need to go to court for the reaffirmation. Chase will send you a reaffirmation agreement and once you sign and return it, they'll file it with the Court and the Court will either approve it or deny it based on the information contained therein.. That's it",
        "It is up to Chase whether or not they require a reaffirmation agreement. If they do, they will have to prepare the paperwork, set a court date and you will have to appear and satisfy the judge that the reaffirmation is in your best interests. If you have a lawyer, he/she can sign off on the reaffirmation for you but many will not do so for fear of claims of malpractice if you miss the payments and the vehicle winds up getting repoed anyway. Then you are on the hook for the deficiency balance.",
        "In my experience with Chase, it depends on the amount owed. If this is a higher end loan, they will exercise their rights to repossess. If the car is not worth much, they will not be that aggressive. In Illinois, you would have a reaffirmation hearing because you are not represented by an attorney.",
        "This is why having an attorney helps. Find one in Irvine that can advise you about what happens in your court, and how Chase deals with this issue in your district. If you do not reaffirm, Chase could continue to allow you to keep the vehicle as long as it is being paid, OR, it could repossess as soon as you get your discharge, even if your payments are current. Only someone who has experienced what Chase does where you are can answer you concerns."

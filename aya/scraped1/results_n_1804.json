    "answers": [
        "Voluntary payments to a specific creditor may be made after a discharge. It is true that the discharge eliminates your legal obligation to a creditor, but you may nonetheless choose to pay the creditor back because of your moral/religious beliefs and convictions.",
        "Bankruptcy will remove the legal obligation to pay a debt, not the moral obligation. If you feel that you want to continue to pay back a debt after bankruptcy you are free to do so and can in any matter that you see fit. However, even a discharged debt can be revived to become enforceable if you agree to reaffirm the debt.",
        "The only ones to consider are family, friends, and local trades people or medical providers.\nBanks will have written off the loss and probably have no method to credit the payment.",
        "Keep in mind that your chapter 7 discharge wiped away these debts. So, payments that you make are up to you, despite being under no obligation to do so. So exercise caution if choose to go this route.",
        "People often do this with family and friends. Not much benefit to doing so with companies, and they have no obligation to be \"nice\" afterward, not to give you another loan, not to give you a credit card, nothing.",
        "You are under no legal obligation, but may send payment voluntarily. There is some question as to whether making payment after discharge creates a new obligation to pay. Consult with a consumer lawyer.",
        "Yes. You may make voluntary payments to a creditor after debt discharged in BK.\nSimply make the payment in any form you wish. Check often advised. This will facilitate accurate record keeping.\nNote that you are under no legal obligation to make payments on discharged debt. Creditor may not take any action to collect the debt.\nI do not recommend reaffirmation of debt.",
        "Bankruptcy prohibits collection efforts against you. Nothing in bankruptcy prohibits you from voluntarily paying a creditor after bankruptcy. In fact, people commonly repay loans to family and friends after bankruptcy. If the creditor is a financial institution you may need to call to get a payment address.",
        "All you have to do is mail a check, drop by the business and pay with cash or send by mail or make a payment in person with a money order. If you pay any other way other than by check get a receipt. Please understand that even if you pay the entire debt over a period of time, that does not mean that the creditor must make a loan to you afterwards."

    "title": "How does a bank levy work?",
    "question": "I would like to understand how the sheriff's bank levy works. The info sheet I received from the bank states that there is a start date, and an expiration date. Is it a one time removal? I know they hold it for a specified period then release it to the creditors. Is there some time period between these levy orders? Do they have to set another one up, or can they just go in at any time and remove funds?",
    "answers": [
        "In addition to consulting a consumer debt collection defense attorney, You may want to consider your overall situation, if you have significant other debt, even if current, you may benefit from a consultation with and expereienced local bankruptcy attorney.",
        "First is a lawsuit against you resulting a judgment for a certain amount.\n\nSecond the creditor applies for a writ of execution allowing the sheriff to take your assets and or wages to pay the judgment.\n\nThird the creditor take the writ of possession along with an application for. Bank levy for the sheriff to execute.\n\nFourth the sheriff serves the writ and bank levy on the bank.\n\nFifth the debtor (you) is given time claim an exemption to the bank levy.\n\nIf an exemption is given to levying officer within the time prescribed, the sheriff will give the exemption to the creditor. The creditor can they request a hearing regarding the validity of the exemption.

The creditor can apply for additional bank levies if needed.\n\nHope this helps.",
        "The explanation appears to be accurate from your understanding. If they want another shot at your bank account, they must wait several months then get another writ and have the sheriff serve it. Meantime, they can do other enforcement actions, such as wage garnishment or have you come to the court to answer questions under oath with your financial documents. How did you get a judgment against you and when did you first learn of this lawsuit? If they did not serve you, perhaps there is time for you to retain a debt collection DEFENSE attorney and get the judgment set aside, which can then restore the funds that were taken by this levy and prevent future levies. The sooner that you get this resolved, the less it will likely cost you.

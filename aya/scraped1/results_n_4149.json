        "I disagree with the answers provided by the other attorneys. Unlike other states, in California, sales taxes are NOT trust fund taxes, they are excise taxes and are dischargeable in bankruptcy so long as the requisite amount of time has passed. As a prerequisite, however, you must properly notify the State taxing agencies that your corporation has been closed and have filed the proper final tax returns. This is so that the taxes can be legally assessed to start the ticking of the clock on the time rules for discharging taxes. A CPA can help you with this. So, as long as you meet the time rules for discharging taxes in bankruptcy, you can get rid of these in a personal bankruptcy.\n\nHowever, a corporation does not receive a discharge in bankruptcy and to the extent the corporation is still open, it will remain liable. Based on your language above that you \"had\" a corporation, it sounds like the corporation is now closed. If that's the case, the taxes become a personal liability and may discharged in bankruptcy as described above.",
        "Sounds like you need tax resolution assistance, not bankruptcy.",
        "If the sales taxes have been charged to you personally they are non-dischargeable in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy. In that situation I usually recommend that you file a Chapter 13 bankruptcy and pay them back through a plan of reorganization if you have the disposable income to support the plan payments.",
        "Filing a personal bankruptcy in most states will not discharge most taxes. Than may be different in California. You need to consult with a good California attorney, preferable one who knows both taxes and banrkuptcy. There is no need to file a bankruptcy for the corporation. A corporation does not get a discharge of its debts.",
        "I personal do NOT practice tax law...only bankruptcy. However, one other addition to the other answers is to ask the tax attorney, is there a statute of limitations on collection of that debt..I do not know but we do not know how old those taxes are from your listed facts. Good luck.",
        "You first need an expert in handling your state's version of IRS Form 433-A/B and Form 656. These are the Offer in Compromise forms.",
        "I agree with Mr. Steingraber. While under certain circumstances income taxes owed can be discharged, sales taxes are not income taxes and are considered a priority unsecured debt that cannot be discharged.\n\nAlso, do not file bankruptcy for the corporation. A corporation can't get its debts discharged in a bankruptcy. It won't change your liability. If you do file, there will be a bankruptcy trustee who may seek information or even reimbursement of money you've withdrawn from the corporation. You may even be faced with the choice of losing such an action or disclosing information that could be used against you in a criminal action.\n\nGet yourself a tax attorney, CPA or Enrolled Agent experienced with dealing with resolving clients' tax obligations to the State Board.",
        "You will not get a discharge for sales taxes owed by a corp w/o assets. Don't waste your time or money bankrupting the corporation."

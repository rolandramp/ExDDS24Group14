        "A legal separation would require both parties to actually divide their assets and debts so this avenue could help you in getting protection as to his potential negligence. But a legal separation means you are still married to him even though you have divided the assets and debts. Also suggest that any separation agreement contain indemnification clauses. Seek the services of a skilled family law attorney.",

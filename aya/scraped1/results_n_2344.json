        "Agree with all other posters that 'divorce' in CA is possible (although issues of property and children will not be handled if located in Mexico) BUT the difficult part is getting your wife served in Mexico. Maybe the consulate maybe could help, first go to the self-help center at your local superior court and get them to help you file a Petition for Dissolution and ask if they can help with service.",
        "As the other attorneys answered, California would have jurisdiction over the status of you marriage as long as you have lived in the state for at least six months. It can also have jurisdiction over any property in the state and even in a foreign country. As the other have stated, a problem is that the state my not have jurisdiction over the children. whether California has jurisdiction over the issue of custody is whether the court determines that California is the home state of the children. That is governed under California law. You have not given enough facts to determine whether California can have jurisdiction over the custody issue. There is also the issue of parentage for the child from another man. These issues can get pretty complicated such that an attorney should be consulted and hired.",
        "The Superior Court in your County has jurisdiction over the marriage and can terminate it. Issues relating to child custody, support, assets, and debts will be more complicated and presumptively need to be resolved in Mexico but that cannot be determined from the paucity of your post. You can start the process, and maybe complete it, with the help of the free Family Law Facilitator at your Courthouse.",
        "Depends where the children of the marriage live. Are they minors? While you can file for divorce here in Los Angeles, provided you meet the residency requirements, and provided she is properly served, the court here, cannot adjudicate issues related to child custody if the children live in Mexico.",
        "You need to look for a family lawyer for this case. There also may be a way to file your divorce where you live at. I am directing your question to the right place."

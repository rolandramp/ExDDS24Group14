    "title": "Does California's homestead exemption apply in cases of fraud?",
    "question": "If a California debtor is found by the courts to be fraudulent, and his debt deemed nondischargeable, is his home equity still protected by California's homestead exemption? (His only asset is his home, worth about $400k, and I'm guesstimating his mortgage to about $200,000 . If the $100k homestead exemption applies, there's not a lot left to seize.)",

        "Need more facts...I agree with my colleagues but....there is always a solution.\nIt seems the person is very smart and succeeded to just take a big bite from You.\nIn my opinion you need to investigate other avenues for collection and you need to speak with a lawyer that knows about fraud fraudsters and much more.\nFew of US in avvo we are not only lawyers but also fraud examiners (CFE) and we deal with problems like yours",
        "Unless he perpetrated a fraud against you, and unless that fraud involved his obtaining title to the residence from you fraudulently, the homestead exemption protects his interest from levy. Be sure to record the Abstract of Judgment because that will prevent him from refinancing or selling the property. And be sure to renew the judgment every 10 years. And, add interest to the amount of the judgment at 10% by filing the appropriate interest calculation with the court. Also, the moment he moves out of the residence, the homestead exemption no longer applies.",
        "Generally, even where this is some fraud, as long as it was not in connection with the property, a debtor would be entitled to the homestead exemption. There are exceptions, and to determine if any applied to your situation, you should consult with a local attorney.",
        "I would think so, unless the fraud is somehow connected to the the acquisition of the residence. If the Fraud event arose from an independent transaction, then likely not, without some connection to the acquisition of the residence."

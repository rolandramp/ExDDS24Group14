    "title": "EDD overpayment and Chapter 7 bankruptcy",
    "question": "I went on disability in December. I went back to work 6 weeks later and was told by the doctor that he cleared me for work. I never received any claim forms like I was anticipating, to certify benefits or report that I went back to work. I usually get these in the mail other times I had to collect unemployment. I've been receiving automatic payments inadvertently for 8 weeks to the tune of $3,000. My fianc√©e has been using the card for online purchases and to pay bills, and my income is high enough that we didn't even realize this until a couple weeks ago, before getting a lawyer. I tried to report the actual date I went back to work with this online system , and keep getting this message \"we're sorry , SDI Online is currently experiencing issues .\" I have called them REPEATEDLY with nobody answering the phone. can't go to their office personally because I work nights and out of town as a driver. I want to make this right but don't want to be accused of fraud for this mistake. I listed them as a creditor in my chapter 7 bankruptcy , which filed yesterday. Will they object at the 341 meeting ?not pursue it ? I have no notice of overpayment at this time but they did overpay me $3k",

        "First, if you have hired an attorney for bankruptcy purposes, you are best off to receive guidance from your legal counsel. If you do not have an attorney, you may want to hire someone to help you through the rest of your bankruptcy case, including 341(a) hearing, communications with the chapter 7 trustee, and communications with any creditors, not to mention advising your correctly through the duration of your case.\n\nNow to the EDD: typically speaking, if scheduled properly in your case an EDD overpayment claim is a dischargeable debt. However, in the future, if you happen to make a claim to EDD for assistance, it may very well withhold future payments to you for purposes of offseting its claim scheduled in your bankruptcy case.\n\nBesides offering to you these general principles of law and bankruptcy procedure, since we are not your attorney, we cannot give you any legal advice for you to rely on. If you still need help, talk to an experienced bankruptcy attorney (or two) and considering getting legal representation for the duration of your bankruptcy case - you'll sleep better and will be happy you did.\n\nBest of luck\n\nBest of luck"

In other words, you can file BK, discharge your unsecured debts, and keep your retirement money held in the 401k accounts. 3. If you are behind on house payments, you can file Chap 13 BK, pay off your past due amounts over as much as 60 months, keep your house, keep your retirement, keep other property too, like car, furniture, jewelry, etc.\n\nBest advice?

Without going into each and every one, it is highly unlikely.\n\nWhat you are considering is cashing out what you have saved for your survival when you are 70+ years old, to pay off debt which could be discharged or paid off in other ways (such as a debt consolidation, credit counseling or chapter 13 plan), and incurring taxes which you will have to pay next year.\n\nPlease reconsider. If your debts are that onerous, sit down with a bankruptcy attorney or other financial advisor to discuss other options.

You have to repay it over a five-year period, which payments are withheld from your paycheck. You cannot liquidate your 401(k) nor can anyone force you to do so. Check with your company."

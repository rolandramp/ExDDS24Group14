        "A prenuptial agreement is made in contemplation of marriage. A postnuptial agreement is entered into by 2 spouses after marriage. If done in compliance with the CA Family Code, prenuptial agreements are presumptively valid..

This does not mean that the postnuptial agreement will not be enforced, but it shifts the burden of proof.\n\nWhether you choose a prenuptial or postnuptial agreement, you both should have your own independent attorneys who should sign off on the agreement.

        "Community property is liable for the premarital debts of the parties, except for earnings that are kept separate. The separate property of one spouse is not liable for the premarital debts of the other spouse. Money you put in a joint checking account after marriage is going to be community property, and can be reached by your fiance's creditors after your marriage. Therefore the solution to your problem is to prevent community property from arising in your marriage. In general, you can do that in a prenup which provides that all your earnings during the marriage are your separate property, and that any business you may own when you marry will remain your separate property. I'd advise you to do a prenup rather than a postnup, whose validity might be questioned as a fraudulent conveyance. As my colleagues have suggested, getting a bulletproof prenup is difficult because of relatively new statutory requirements.

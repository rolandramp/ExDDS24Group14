    "title": "Have had wages garnished from Nelson and Kannard. Can I negotiate a lesser lump sum payment?",
    "question": "Wages garnished by Nelson and Kannard. Offered them about 60% of the amount due in a lump sum payment. They said they were only able to accept 100% payment. Is this typically true or what can I do to get them to negotiate for less? Thanks.",
    "answers": [
        "Negotiation requires that you give them something in exchange for them giving you something. What are you offering them? Why did you wait so long? You would have had better bargaining leverage before they went to court and got a judgment against you. Did you ask for a trial? Or did you just allow a default judgment to be entered against you?",
        "You could always threaten to file for bankruptcy if they won't settle. Sometimes that works - other times the creditor says \"Go ahead and file.\"",
        "It would help to know how much is owed. However, as the others have stated, the time to do this negotiation was BEFORE you got garnished. There is value in the lump sum in so far as money now is more valuable and more certain than money over time. But if you already offered 60% and they said no, what else can you offer to sweeten deal? (not much, aside from offering a higher amount).\n\nCreditors don't have to settle with you. Heres the thing, they are already garnishing your wages and receiving a steady stream of revenue. You show up and offer 60%. You have demonstrated to them a likely ability to pay the entire debt. There is no real trick to debt settlement, there is a number they are willing to accept, and a number you are able to pay. If those numbers overlap, you settle, if not, you don't. There is nothing you can say or threaten that changes that dynamic.",
        "The creditor has no motivation to settle for less than 100 per cent if it already has a judgment and a way to get up to 25 per cent of your net wages. The only way you would have leverage to settle is if the judgment were not valid and could be set aside; or if you were able to claim your income as exempt, and the creditor would have to keep filing the wage garnishment documents over and over until it was able to get something. (Find out more about exemptions for wage judgments on nolo.com, see link below.)\n\nAlso, if this judgment is very large and/or if you have other debts, you may want to consider filing a bankruptcy case.",
        "They will always evaluate what you offer against what they can get by continuing the garnishment. They also get attorneys fees and interest on top of the debt so if the money is coming in steadily, they have little incentive to settle. I'm not sure what happens in CA, but around here they have to go back to court every 3 months for an accounting. If something similar happens there, they might be willing to settle at that time.",
        "Your bargaining power is now severely limited by the fact that they are garnishing your wages and payback on the amount owed has begun. A creditor/creditor attorney can always negotiate to settle for less than what is owed but it becomes more difficult when there is an actual means to receive payback, i.e. wage garnishment."

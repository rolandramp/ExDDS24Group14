        "I agree with my colleague - insufficient information has been provided in order to give you some guidance. However, I urge you to speak with your bankruptcy attorney - if you filed your case without an attorney, I urge you to seek legal guidance regarding this matter from a local bankruptcy attorney as soon as possible.",
        "It is very difficult to determine what exactly you are asking, and therefore, to state \"which form\" you need. First, what chapter bankruptcy did you husband file. Secondly who is \"they\" ? What money are you supposed to get? It is not clear what money you are due from \"income tax\". Did your income tax refund get intercepted? By whom? Was there a wage garnishment issued? By whom? Typically, wages that are garnished are sent to the creditor, via the Sheriff's office.\nDoes you husband have an attorney? If so, you way want to direct your concerns to that attorney as that person will have all the facts."

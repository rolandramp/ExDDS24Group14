    "title": "Does a student loan co. need to file a \"Proof of Claim\" in bankruptcy court against a lender if the loan is nondischargeable?",
    "question": "I recently flied bankruptcy (and had my 341 hearing) and I know my students loans are not dischargeable, but I discovered today that one of the private student loan lenders filed a \"Proof of Claim\" with the bankruptcy court and I was wondering why they would do that if the loan was not dischargeable to begin with? My other private student loan lenders did not do this, just this one lender. I'm very curious as to what possible reason would be for them to do this, so if you could give me some possible theoretical explanations as to why it would be necessary for them to do this, that would be greatly appreciated. I have not attempted to file an adversary proceeding at this time either, it's just a straight Chapter 7 bankruptcy. Also, they did not show up at my 341 Hearing. Thank you.",

        "If the chapter 7 had no assets available for distribution to the creditors then the creditors need not file a proof of claim. Apparently, they did so anyway, perhaps without understanding the laws. It will have no impact on the case. Just a waste of paper.",
        "In chapter 7 cases it is not necessary to file a proof of claim at all unless there are assets the trustee will be administering. In spite of this there are a number of creditors who prepare and file them in every case routinely. There is no harm in doing so, and by making it an automatic part of their in-house procedures the creditors protect themselves in case there is an Notice of Possible Dividend mailed out by the trustee at some point in the future.\nIt is nothing to be concerned or worried about.",
        "they do that to protect their interest if you either filed or convert to a Chapter 13, so they get paid under the plan. If you filed a chapter 7, and don't convert, it has very little practical effect on your case."

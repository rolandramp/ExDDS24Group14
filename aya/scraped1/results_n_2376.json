        "I recommend you get a lawyer to draft a letter to Chase when you send your first payment. The letter will recite the terms of the settlement you verbally reached with them. If Chase cashes the payment, that will constitute their acceptance of the terms outlined in your letter. Click the Avvo tab \"Find a Lawyer\". Many of us offer free consultation.",

        "Most auto lenders would rather have your monthly payment, with interest, than the car. If you are able to bring the loan current, and then continue making the monthly payment they are requesting, then more than likely they will not repossess the car, and once you have completed making all of the payments under your loan contract, you will receive the title to the vehicle.\n\nBut, if the lump-sum payment they are requesting would still leave you behind, then it is possible they are just trying to get as much money from you as possible before repossessing the car. One thing to keep in mind is that just because the loan was \"charged off\", it doesn't mean it is no longer owed. A charge-off is just an accounting term to indicate they do not believe the loan will be paid. You posted this question under the heading of Bankruptcy. If by \"charge off\" you mean the debt was actually discharged in a Bankruptcy, then you need to keep in mind that a Bankruptcy discharge of a secured debt, such as this one for your car, just means that you are no longer personally liable for the debt. But the vehicle is still \"liable\" on the debt in that it is security for the loan and is subject to being repossessed.\n\nYou should take a close look at how much money you have invested into this vehicle, it's current value, and whether it is worth paying however much more money toward trying to keep it. If you file a Bankruptcy, you can surrender the car back to the lender and have no further personal liability for the debt. IF you are not in a Bankruptcy (or if this debt has not already been discharged in a bankruptcy), and you surrender the vehicle (or it is repossessed), then the lender will re-sell the vehicle at public auction and then come after you for the deficiency, which would be the difference between what they were able to re-sell it for and what you still owed on the loan.\n\nIf you are thinking Bankruptcy might help your situation, then I would recommend you seek a consultation with an experienced local bankruptcy attorney, who will be able to meet with you and review your entire financial situation and determine whether a Bankruptcy would be good for you or not. Most bankruptcy attorneys will offer a free initial consultation."

    "title": "Will Synchrony bank sue me for $5000?",
    "question": "I have fallen so far into debt that I have been unable to pay any of my six accounts for the past six months, and Synchrony is the first to suggest they may sue. My only income right now is my monthly SSI check, and I spend that entirely each month, with nothing left to pay any of my credit accounts. Half goes towards room and board, and a sizable portion goes to various bills for services I use.",
    "answers": [
        "Yes, the creditor could sue you for the debt, as well as any other creditors who you have past due balances with. It seem like you may qualify for Chapter 7 Bankruptcy if you do not own much and your income is low. I recommend meeting with some experienced bankruptcy attorneys to discuss your financial situation and see what options are best for you.",
        "It may be a very good idea to meet with a local bankruptcy attorney in your area. I recommend Stuart Steingraber. He has an office right there in Riverside",
        "Synchrony Bank often will she people for low balances (or sell off the debt to a collector who will sue on their behalf). Your income of SSDI like means they have limited ability to collect from you, but it does not mean they cannot get a judgment. I would recommend talking to a local attorney right now about your income and all your debts right now. Reviewing all your options would be important to know what rights you have and what may benefit your situation. Many lawyers offer free consultations, and with your limited income, you may qualify for reduced rate legal services with a non profit, like legal aid."

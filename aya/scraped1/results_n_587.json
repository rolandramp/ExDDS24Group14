    "title": "I racked up about $80,000 in gambling debts. Is this dischargeable with Chapter 7 bankruptcy?",
    "question": "I am wondering if there will be any problems with filing for chapter 7 bankruptcy. Most of this amount was taken out through cash advances on my credit card. All my gambling debts are from credit cards.",
    "answers": [
        "These types of debts can be dischargeable. There is a special window for taking out cash advances prior to a bankruptcy filing that could make those debts falling within that window non-dischargeable. There are also factors to consider, however, gambling debts are typically dischargeable. The gamblers we have represented all had their gambling debts discharged. Some of them had to present their player's card statements to the trustee, but the debt was still discharged.\n\nI highly recommend you consult with an experienced bankruptcy attorney that has represented other people in your situation and that have had gambling debts. There are many great bankruptcy lawyers here on AVVO. I suggest you reach out to one of them.",
        "All the other answers are excellent. But I will throw a different wrench into the machinery. Think about how to prove you really did lose all that money gambling. Creditors or the trustee might think you still have the money. Your discharge is susceptible to being denied if you can't provide a satisfactory explanation for the loss or disappearance of the money. Look for evidence beyond just your own word, like casino records that might track your wins and loses.",
        "Should be dischargeable debt unless the Casino objects to the bk on the grounds that your credit card debt knowing you would be unable to pay. But I have never seen that happen and I have represented several gamblers. Please join gamblers anonymous and put yourself on the no entry list at your favorite casinos. You can only file bankruptcy once every eight years and you don't want to be here again. And don't try to file without an attorney.",
        "Debts incurred for \"luxury goods and services\" within 90 days of filing can potentially be deemed nondischargeable. Have you been making monthly payments on the credit cards?",
        "Most often credit card debt is dischargeable in bankruptcy, with a few exceptions. However, you need to be aware that the Credit Card industry has kept up with technology. They have all kinds of algorithms, bars and graphs, historical data, etc. that they use to attempt to contest your discharge if the debt was acquired within a short period of time prior to filing the bankruptcy. You would be best advised to consult with a qualified Bankruptcy Attorney who is experienced in dealing with these type of situations. If you think you can pull it off on your own, you are sorely mistaken. You will regret every minute of trying to be cheap and not pay an experienced legal professional to guide and direct you through the bankruptcy process. Contact an Attorney today!",
        "In most cases, credit card debt is dischargeable if the debts were not incurred more than 90 days before the case is filed, and there are no indicators of fraud (such as, the debtor bought luxury goods while experiencing financial hardship, and knowing that he or she will be unable to pay for them). Gambling debts are not typically associated with fraud. Discuss your assets and debts with a bankruptcy attorney."

    "title": "Does an order to shorten time always have to be exparte, accompanied by temp emergency orders court form?",
    "question": "I wish for my motion to be heard prior to trial, but no immediate harm would result to the child from the motion not being heard. I am requesting an order to shorten time so my motion, which is asking for a continuance, so I can seek legal representation will be heard prior to going to trial date. The form FL-010, reads emergency temp orders, but then also lists \"An order to shorten time\". So the form is somewhat confusing.",
    "answers": [
        "The forms are confusing because the State Rules of Court on point are incompetently drafted.\nhttp://www.courts.ca.gov/cms/rules/index.cfm?title=five&linkid=rule5_151\nhttp://www.courts.ca.gov/cms/rules/index.cfm?title=five&linkid=rule5_165\n\nThe Judicial Council is notoriously inept with its Family Court rules and forms and is home to \"Order to Show Cause\" and \"Request for Order\" as trade jargon for \"Motion\" and as home of the interlapping \"Property Declaration\" and \"Schedule of Assets and Debts\".",
        "I agree with Ms. Jasinski, the forms can be very confusing. And to make matters worse, the procedures for ex parte motions and orders shortening time differ from county to county. I would suggest you hire an attorney. If you cannot afford one, visit your local Family Law Facilitator for help filing out and filing your forms.",
        "Yes, the forms can often be confusing because they can't fit every situation.\n\nThe only way I know of to seek an order shortening time is on an ex parte basis. It seems to make sense that if you want to continue the trial date to hire counsel, you will need to get that in front of the judge before the trial begins. Do it sooner, rather than later and if you have already found an attorney have him or her file the ex parte."

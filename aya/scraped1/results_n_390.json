    "question": "I am currently getting a divorce and need to file bankruptcy.",
    "answers": [
        "I don't do Family Law but the general rule in connection with divorce orders is that the only debts considered nondischargeable are the orders for spousal support and child support.\n\nPayments having to do with property separation have been discharged, especially in a chapter 13 case where there are more \"loopholes\" (if you will) following BAPCPA in 2005.\n\nThat said, I only vaguely know what a \"Watts charge\" is and it would be good to hear from an attorney who practices both in Family Law and in Bankruptcy Law, who may have had the exact situation.",
        "As I understand it, a \"Watts charge\" is an obligation to the other spouse for one-half of the reasonable value for the exclusive use of a community asset after date of separation. If the obligation has a monetary value and if the obligation is not in the nature of support, but rather property settlement, it can be discharged in BK."

    "title": "My boyfriend owes Feds restitution fees for fraud, embesselment. If we get married does debt become mine?",
    "question": "We have not commingled anything. My homes and accts were mine before knowing him. He does not work and I support him. He lives in my home four years now. I do not claim him on my taxes either. If we marry how would this affect me financially? Or is it best not to marry? Also, he cannot get a license or ID in CA due to a warrant back in NY from 15 years ago. He did five years Federal time in TX already for fraud. Apparently he will need to travel to NY to face judge/court to clear up warrant. How can he fly with no ID. He only has prison ID from release 2009. Is there an attorney that can run his name to see what warrant is for and we get it taken care of? Please advise....",

        "Avvo doesn't charge you anything to post a question & you are welcome to post as many different questions as you like. Since your questions cover many different areas of the law, you will get more useful answers by posting each question in its own area of the law. Marrying someone doesn't make their debts your debts legally, but as a practical matter, when you marry, the household operates as a single unit. So you pay for your husband's debt in the sense that he can't contribute as much when he has other debts that he must pay. And if he doesn't pay restitution, are you willing to let him go back to prison? Probably not, so as a practical matter, you have made his debts your debts even though the law doesn't say so. Hope this perspective helps!",
        "Restitution owed in connection with a criminal conviction will not be considered a \"community debt\" so you would not be responsible for it, if you were to get married.\n\nYou have asked a number of other about related subjects, and you may want to break them up as follows:\n--Question about how to handle outstanding warrant (NY) - in order to allow him to get a California drivers license or other ID (he needs a criminal lawyer)\n--Question about restitution owed in connection with fraud case (TX) (criminal lawyer)\n--Question about how to protect your home or other assets if you were to get married (you would likely need a prenuptial agreement -- you will need a family law specialist, a person who has experience with prenuptial agreements.\n\nGood luck."

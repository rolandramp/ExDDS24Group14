    "question": "I need to file a chapter 7 bankruptcy soon. Naturally, I want to use a qualified attorney but money is a concern. What can I expect to pay? Do any attorneys offer the option to make payments?",

        "As mentioned by others, most attorneys offer a free initial consultation, at which point they will find out about what you own, the debts you owe, your income, your monthly or other expenses and ask you questions about events that may have occurred over the past year or two. All of this is important in determining the complexity of the case and how much time will be required to make sure your case goes as expected.\n\nI have seen fees advertised for ridiculously low amounts. Many of these are \"typing services\" in disguise and you won't get much legal advice from an attorney. The experience of the attorney matters too, since sometimes issues or problems that might have been discovered and resolved before filing can be missed by someone that is inexperienced or is not really able to pay attention to your case because of the law price.\n\nEven a very experienced bankruptcy attorney is not going to be really expensive for a simple or moderately complicated case, because they know how to handle it. You will find that sort of experience from several of the attorneys you see here on Avvo with high ratings.\n\nSet an appointment with an experienced bankruptcy attorney that is near you and spend 30-60 minutes to find out how your case would work and what the costs will be. That should be free and that's a great deal!",
        "Chapter 7 fees vary depending on the amount of experience your bankruptcy attorney has and the complexity of your case. The first typical cost is the filing fee which is $335.\nThe cost of an attorney is also the cost of receiving your discharge, making sure all of the documents are filed in your case timely and correctly. The cost of discharge of your debts and the cost of making sure your vehicle loan is reaffirmed so your vehicle is protected from repossession if you are current and keep it properly insured after bankruptcy. The cost of keeping your assets because you used the correct exemptions. The cost of understanding the bankruptcy laws as they apply to your unique set of facts.\nVery important you trust your attorney and are comfortable knowing your attorney is working for your best interests to achieve the best possible financial remedy for your situation.\nMany attorneys offer options for payments, however, in chapter 7, the fees are due before filing.\nTake advantage of a free consultaiton with a knowledgeable bankruptcy attorney in your area.",
        "Many attorneys allow you to make payments but won't file the bankruptcy petition until they have been paid in full. As to fees, many factors go into what an attorney charges.

        "How much does a car cost? It depends on a lot of factors. The same is true with a bankruptcy. Anyone that can tell you a price without knowing your income, size of household, type of debt, nature of your assets etc. Is not an attorney you want. Bankruptcy is not about filling out papers. Bankruptcy is about determining whether you qualify based on income in the household compared to the Means test standards. Bankruptcy is about trying to protect assets from being taken by a bankruptcy trustee to pay to your crediors. There is so much more. What you need to do is talk to a real quality bankruptcy attorney who actually understands that they are not a paper pusher, one that realizes that bankruptcy is a tool box. Having tools does not make a master mechanic. Knowing how to use those tools is want makes the master mechanic. Meet with a quality attorney, preferrably a State Bar Certified Bankruptcy Law Specialist. Check on the AVVO rating. Look at Yelp. Talk to more than one attorney and compare what they do. Are you a dollar sign? Or are you a person who the attorney is willing to go over your situation and explain the law to you in understandable terms. If in doubt, walk."

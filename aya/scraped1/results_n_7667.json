    "question": "Okay, so long story short. Credit card judgment was discharged and I am no longer \"personally liable\". However, they had filed an abstract of judgement with the county prior to the chapter 7. The 7 discharge was granted but I wasn't able to have the lien avoided or removed.",

        "Your personal liability on the debt is gone. I am surprised that you could not avoid the lien especially with no equity in the home but then I do not know all the fact surrounding your motion to avoid. In California a judgement draws interest at 10% simple interest so the abstract lien will lay on the property collecting interest at that rate until you sell the house. Depending on the size of the judgment lien and the amount of the first and your homestead exemption it is unlikely that the abstract holder will try to foreclose. It will make it very difficult to refinance the home though. Your home stead exemption takes priority over the abstract so depending on your circumstances you will shield between $50,000 and $150,000 of the equity in the home ahead of the judgment lien.",
        "Based upon the information given I too am unsure why you would not have been able to avoid the lien of the judgment if this is your homestead property. I don't believe interest will accrue. The life of a judgment lien is dictated by state statute, but if it's a long time (some states 10+ years), you may have a problem.",
        "I agree with Mr. Bollinger's comments about the interest.\n\nI would like to add that most states have a limit on the amount of time a judgment lien is valid. Once the time expires, the judgment no longer exists. You should contact a lawyer in your state to find out the length of time judgment liens are valid in your state. You may be told that a judgment lien can be renewed. This is true in most states, but once you filed bankruptcy on the underlying judgment, the judgment creditor no longer has a basis on which to renew the lien.",
        "Accepting for the moment your statement that the lien was not avoidable under 11 USC §522 (f)–which is a bit of a stretch on the facts provided— you raise the question of whether a judgment that is discharged and cannot—as a judgment—draw interest; nevertheless accumulate interest on the basis of the lien.\n\nCan the Tail wag the Dog?\n\nIn my Missouri lawyer opinion, judgment liens, stripped of the underlying judgment by discharge in bankruptcy, cannot accumulate additional interest. (I have no case law to support this doctrine, but I stand ready to be surprised by my colleagues if some court has ruled on this issue)."

        "I agree with my colleagues in that you should start taking the steps necessary to move your case along. Once you take these steps, your soon to be ex still might not show up since he is seeing nothing happen. You can be in the driver's seat. Depending on your financial status or your soon to be ex, consider hiring an attorney so you don't have to be frustrated with an idle case. If you are having these questions about moving the case, you really need to have a consultation with a family law attorney to make sure you are covering all of the issues associated with a divorce.",
        "Have you file a request for default and asked the court to set a default trial? Even if he doesn't show and he as responded, still ask the court to set a trial date and give him notice. If he fails to show for trial, then you can proceed without him.",
        "Well, status conferences don't really mean anything. The status conference is designed for the parties to check in with the Court and advise of their progress and to keep something on calendar so that the case doesn't fall through the cracks. However, procedurally, the status conference isn't something that your spouse can get punished for failing to attend, even if it was three times.\n\nWhat you need to do is request a mandatory settlement conference utilizing the local form \"VN086\". You can either google that or find it for free on the Ventura Superior Court Website. That will trigger a mandatory settlement conference (MSC). When your spouse fails to attend the MSC, you can ask the judge for a trial date. If your spouse fails to show up at trial, you ask the judge for whatever it is you want. If you want to be single in the meantime (i.e. you want to get remarried, or be single for another reason), then you can file a motion to bifurcate (separate out) the issue of marital status while the process of dividing assets and debts, and other issues are still pending.\n\nFile a VN086--start there."

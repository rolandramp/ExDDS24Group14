    "title": "I had a credit card with American Express with a balance of around $13,000. [...] A default judgement with bank levy in effect.",
    "question": "I was previously making the payments but came into financial issues (almost lost my home in foreclosure), ignored the notifications from AMEX and ultimately the debt was sent to ARSI for collections with a local attorney handling the claim. Fast forward a few months of not responding (my fault), a default judgement was awarded. Most recently, a bank levy was processed against one of my accounts. Including a safe deposit box where I am only an authorized key holder.",

        "Limited options at this stage.\nToo late to answer the original claim.\nAlso too late to utilize ADR because judgment has been entered.\nYou may try to contact opposing attorney and negotiate resolution.\nIf this and other debts are oppressive, suggest you consider bankruptcy.\nConsult BK counsel before proceeding.",
        "At this point, the only thing that changes any of what's happening is a bankruptcy. A chapter 7 would discharge the debt and end all future collection activities on this debt, and any other debts or judgments you may have. You'd want to file right away to stop them from taking more money or garnishing wages. If you are married they can also garish your spouses wages and levy those accounts as well unfortunately.\nIt is highly unlikely the creditor will negotiate with you at this point as they have done all the work to get your money, all they have to do now is sit back and wait for the bank/sheriff to collect for them. The underlying case has also already been decided (in the creditors favor) and can not be re-litigated unfortunately. There are many excellent local bankruptcy attorneys that can help you.",
        "It is too late to answer the original claim. It is also too late to utilize ADR because you already have Judgment against you. However, you can contact the local Attorney handling the case for the creditor to see if you can settle. The collectors are always willing to settle.\n\nOne more thing, if the safe deposit box that was levied is not yours, then you need to go to Court and file Motion for return of the levied items.",
        "What are you looking to accomplish here? The AMEX collection train has already run over you, and is rolling down the levy and garnishment tracks. You have buried your head in the sand for many months while AMEX hired an attorney and obtained a default judgment on you. You have been in the ostrich mode with your head buried in the sand, while AMEX was putting the train on the tracks to run over you. GET A BANKRUPTCY LAWYER. File a Chapter 7 case. Get rid of this judgment, and avoid the judicial lien. It is past the time for negotiation and ADR. You need to wake up and do something appropriate for the situation. File a chapter 7 case now, and get yourself some relief, before you lose your bank account and part of your wages."

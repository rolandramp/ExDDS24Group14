    "title": "Is a surviving spouse responsible for gambling debts incurred by the deceased spouse?",
    "question": "gambling spouse is the breadwinner but we have equity in our home",
    "answers": [
        "Possibly yes and possibly no as it depends on the knowledge of the surviving spouse and whether the surviving spouse was also responsible for creating the debt. Technically the debt is a CP debt but there are exceptions based upon fraud and if the gambling spouse breached their fiduciary duties in creating the debt under California law.",
        "More information is needed to determine whether the deceased spouse has an estate. If not, the debts will not get paid. If there is an estate, the creditors can go after the assets, but they do not always. I would consult with an attorney to discuss the specifics of your situation and what you can do to at least minimize the debt obligation.",
        "Probably--but you may be able to avoid the debt. I will repost this under probate."

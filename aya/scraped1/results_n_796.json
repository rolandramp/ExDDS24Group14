    "title": "Do I have to pay my fathers taxes?",
    "question": "My estranged father passed away with little to his name but a few hundred dollars in the bank, a mountain of medical debt, and a very old car of little value. As the eldest of five I traveled to his state of Colorado to obtain the keys to his apartment and car from the coroner, not really knowing what it meant. I cleaned out the apt and gave the car to my little sister who didn't have one. I closed my fathers bank account, but have recently discovered I must file his taxes. He owes back taxes for previous years. I have the paperwork and for that as well as his 2016 W-2. He passed in February, and did make income in 2017. Do I have to pay some of those back taxes from the little he had in the bank? I wanted to give what little money he had to struggling family members. Do I have to sell his car to pay for his taxes too?",

        "Be very very careful here... your problems go way beyond the IRS or state of Colorado as a creditor. If you step into the role of the executor of your father's estate you could have personal liability for any creditor that does not get paid. The IRS and Colorado would be creditors as well as anyone else your father owes money too. I would suggest you look into a a bankruptcy for the estate with a Colorado estate planning or BK attorney. Theoretically any asset your father had would be required to be liquidated and distributed to creditors before a dime is paid out to the beneficiaries. (any excess of the debts owed) Also - the estate may have been required to have been probated if he died without a will or a living trust."

        "It is unfortunate that you filed so many bankruptcies without resolving your mortgage issues with your lender.

This gives Debtors the protection of the automatic stay while you negotiate a loan modification so you can keep your home.\nTo the best of my knowledge there is no way to bring your home back, however, you may want to check with a real estate litigation attorney that handles wrongful foreclosure matters.\nAbsent filing the wrongful foreclosure lawsuit, prepare to move or work out an agreement to rent your home from the new owners. If you need a bankruptcy wait until you resolve the issues of moving so, if you are served with an eviction action. the debt associated with the court costs, etc. will be discharged in your bankruptcy. If all your chapter 13 bankruptcies were dismissed then you should still be eligible for a ch 7 discharge if your income and expenses pass the means test.",
        "I agree with my colleagues. I assume that you didn't use a lawyer because you couldn't afford one. And if you couldn't afford an attorney, I doubt seriously if you could have completed a chapter 13 bankruptcy. About the best you can hope for now is a rental agreement with the new owner or \"cash for keys\" to move out in a timely fashion.",
        "Unless there was some flaw in the foreclosure process, you are not likely to be able to stay in the home. You might be able to stay on as a rent paying tenant if you can reach an agreement with the successful bidder at the foreclosure auction. Sorry, but I can't think of any other options for you.",
        "Probably there is nothing you can do, unless the foreclosure sale was irregular, or you did not receive proper notice. The chances of that are pretty low, but the only way you can tell is by seeing a lawyer who understands the law of foreclosure and knows a little about bankruptcy. Your third filing third filing had no effect on stopping the foreclosure under the Bankruptcy Code."

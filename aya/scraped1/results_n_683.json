    "question": "Over 10 years ago I enrolled at Redstone College, In the Aviation Mechanic program. When I spoke to the admittance counselor I was told that an entry level mechanic starting pay is 90k a year. And because of my age I would qualify for grants and when I completed the program I would only have to pay around 2k that grants did not cover. I was then sent to a place to take a High school diploma test that is not accredited or worth the paper its printed on. The school also told me they had a 100% job placement Well after I finished the only job the school could find made less per hour than I made working at a Pizza shop. Then the debt collectors started in wanting upwards of $700. a month I then got all the debts consolidated under the Dept of Education. two Months ago I got a letter from another collection agency on behalf of the school claim an additional $8000. bringing to total for my useless education to over $40,000 when the program was only $30,000 is there anything that can be done legally to sue",

        "As stated by atty Rausa , too much time has passed to sue the school for any negligent or intentional misrepresentations, but you may find some relief theories by speaking to a student loan specialist lawyer. D.J. Rausa is one of the best.",
        "I agree with Mr. Rausa, with an additional suggestion that you seek the services of a Bankruptcy Attorney who has turned his focus on discharging some or all of your student loans in Bankruptcy. This area has become very fluid, meaning the Bankruptcy courts are encouraging attorneys to bring cases such as yours before them so that they can see that you need relief. It is worth a free consultation.\n\nOtherwise, I see no other real good option, other than seeking payment arrangements such as Income-based repayment or income-sensitive repayment. Your lender should explain that to you, and there is a lot of material on the Dept. of Education website. I wish you well!",
        "I think you need to look at this differently. If you feel the school did something wrong, then perhaps too much time has transpired to sue the school itself. What you are really after, perhaps, is addressing the debt. That is a different issue. You should consult with a California Student Loan Lawyer because you do have options"

        "With no equity in the property the lenser's interest is not protected if payments are delinquent.\nSection 362 applies to all types of bankruptcy cases - do not mistake the \"title 11\" of the United States Code as a reference to a type of bankruptcy case.\n\nIt sounds as though you are trying to make your way through this without the benefit of counsel. I encourage you to consult (and retain) an attorney to discuss the situation and set ermine what your options may be.",
        "Lack of equity is probably the most common theme to support creditors' motions, because the debtor cannot use the value of the property, to argue there is no loss to the creditor, as an excuse for the debtor not making the required payments.\n\nThe logic is, that there is no adequate protection in the equity value of the property, and no financial reason the property needs to be kept by the debtor, so if the creditor wants it back, then the creditor gets it back, because that is the creditor's contract right for non payment.\n\nThe lift stay section language in your inquiry, applies whether there is a chapter 7 or 13 being considered, is intended to stop serial filing, or fractionalization of property interests, which is an abuse that tends to unduly delay foreclosure.\nCourts tend to apply remedies against debtors, who demonstrate these abusive tendencies.",
        "The idea is that equity protects the bank's interest in the collateral - so that even if the bank is not receiving payments on a loan secured by the collateral, equity in the collateral will increase the bank's likelihood that it will recover the loan balance if the collateral is later liquidated. If the debtor lacks equity in the collateral, the bank is not adequately protected against future decreases in the value of the collateral, and courts will often lift the stay to allow the bank to foreclose on the collateral.\n\nThere is no exact analog to section 362 under sections 7 or 13 of the Code."

    "title": "Must I file a Statement of Intent in 30 days after filing bankruptcy? Court Date is 37 days from filing date. Consequences?",
    "question": "My Chapter 7 was filed less than 30 days ago. My court date is 37 days from when I filed. Been reading lots of online literature that says I need to file a Statement of Intent on secured property, in this case a car within 30 days of filing or first meeting of creditors, whichever is first. I've been told I can wait until the first Meeting of Creditors. Is this true? What will happen if I miss the deadline? Need to know ASAP",
    "answers": [
        "If you miss the deadline, the bankruptcy police will come and take you away and shoot you. Not really. The code requires that a statement of intent be filed within 30 days of the date of filing and it should be done in a timely fashion. There is absolutely no benefit to be gained by waiting until your 341 Meeting of Creditors, so why not file it now? All waiting will do is give the trustee something to ask you about at the meeting and may raise questions in his or her mind about your filing. Go ahead and file the statement of intent.",
        "I agree with Attorney Elie EXCEPT I would never reaffirm almost ever unless there is a reason. Most (99%) of debtor's vehicles are worth less than is owed on them. I would drive it for free w/o making payments and save the money for a down payment on another vehicle later after repossession which creditor might wait till your case is over with.\n\nIf you keep making payments and later, your engine or transmission or other parts quit working, or you cannot afford the payments, or you are in an accident and don't have GAP insurance and the vehicle is worth less than is owed, they the creditor cannot ever come after you for any money as the discharge discharged their debt too..whereas if you had reaffirmed, they can repo it, sell it, and sue you for the difference. And ALSO you may owe income taxes on a reaffirmed debt if repo'd also. Thus, most of my clients ..somewhere between 99 and 100% NEVER reaffirm. Now I do make exceptions, rarely, for co signed loans maybe if co signor has not filed also bankruptcy and my client has a car worth MORE than is owed on it! But Attorney Elie is 100% correct that a creditor MIGHT come repo it later even if caught up. My thought: so what..go buy another car and you are not paying more than it is worth. But most car creditors don't want the car..they want your money and wont repo. I know of ONLY ONE in Washington...Alaska Fed Cred Union and they do to some vehicles, I believe the higher end owed ones. Good luck and I hope you appreciate all of the attorneys answers herein provided to you.\nIt is possible the stay of the bankruptcy could end quicker if you do not file the Statement of Intention by the deadline pursuant to 11 USC 362(h).",
        "You should have filed a statement of intention either with your petition or immediately afterward.\n\nI'm surprised you didn't get a deficiency notice yet.\n\nAnswer is you should file one. If you have a mortgage on your home in California, then do not reaffirm. With respect to a car, that's different.\n\nIf you want to keep your car, then you must reaffirm. If you do not, the auto loan company will have the right to get stay relief and repossess the car. Even if they don't act to get stay relief, right after your discharge is granted, they have a right to come haul your car off, even if you continue making car loan payments.\n\nSee Dumont v Ford Motor Credit (In Re Dumont), 581 F.3d 1104 (9th Cir. 2009)\n\nhttps://www.courtlistener.com/ca9/7tZp/in-re-dumont/?",
        "Attorney Derek Caldwell gave a very good answer. I'll add that I don't understand why you seem to not want to file the Statement of Intent. There's no good reason to not just go ahead and file it. It sounds like you don't have a bankruptcy attorney. I hope the rest of your filing was done with better understanding than you seem to have of the Statement of Intent. That's not at all intended to be derogatory toward you, but just a statement consistent with the fact that there are many possible dangers lurking in a Chapter 7."

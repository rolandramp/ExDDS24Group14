    "title": "Is there a statue of limitation on tuition for a community college?",
    "question": "I attended a community college in the fall of 2006 and never completed a course. Out of the blue last week, I received a letter stating I owed $477 for a delinquent debt. I called this morning asking for an itemized statement showing me details of this debt. I just want to know if they legally can forward this debt to collections if I don't pay? It's been 8 years!",
    "answers": [
        "There is typically a 4 year statute of limitations for debts in California, assuming you went to school here. Although you can't be sued on a debt outside the SOL, it can still be collected upon if owed, but probably not legally enforced. If the collection efforts start getting aggressive and or misleading, you may have an unfair debt collection claim.",
        "ID you have not acknowledged the debt in your communications, then a well crafted letter from an attorney will make it go away. Speak with an attorney who does debt collections defense.",
        "It's likely you don't owe it,but if you were sent bills over the period off time since the depth wasn't heard, that would change the statute of limitations",
        "You need to see what the limitations are. To consult a lawyer you will pay more than the debt unless you use the 38.00 feature here on AVVO. IF the debt is beyond the S/l and there are no exemptions for the college then you might tell them to pound sand and sue you.",
        "Careful. In recent years, aggressive debt collectors have begun trying to enforce debts that are barred by the statute of limitations. They buy these debts from original creditors for pennies on the dollar, so they make a tidy profit when they collect anything. The nature of what you owed is not known but before you do anything, hire counsel to learn the exact details of the supposed debt. Those details will lead to an understanding of the applicable statute"

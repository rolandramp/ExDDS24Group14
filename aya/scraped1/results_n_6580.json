        "In determining eligibility for chapter 7 the law looks at the amount of money you have earned within the 6-months preceeding the filing.

Of course, if you were earning income prior to the filing and not disclosing it, or you had work but willfully chose not to work to circumvent the bankruptcy laws, that's a different story.",
        "The fact that you have obtained employment after filing bankruptcy (but apparently while your case is still pending) certainly does not “void” your bankruptcy. I agree with previous responses that (i) your income as calculated for purposes of the means test is based on the income you received during the 6 month period prior to filing bankruptcy, and (ii) income earned after the date you filed bankruptcy is not property of the bankruptcy estate. However, if your income has increased since the filing of your bankruptcy case, it is possible that you now have excess/disposable income that could be used to fund a Chapter 13 plan. That may constitute an “abuse” under the “totality of the circumstances” and subject you to a motion to dismiss. On the other hand, it is possible that your increase in income does not result in excess/disposable income that could be used to fund a Chapter 13 plan. Obviously, it is impossible for me to say because I do not know the facts of your particular case. I just wanted to point out that an increase in income that occurred after the date you filed bankruptcy may, depending on the circumstances, impact your case even though it does not change the means test calculation and the money itself does not constitute property of the bankruptcy estate.\n\nI suggest that you speak with a bankruptcy attorney to determine whether an amendment to your schedules (particularly, Schedule I) is necessary and the potential impact of any such amendment. Good luck and congratulations on the new job.",
        "Many people that file bankruptcy have jobs - it isn't a requirement to file bankruptcy that you be unemployed or impoverished. No one who files bankruptcy is expected to have a crystal ball to foresee the future, and your new job won't hurt your bankruptcy as long as you provided complete and truthful information in your paperwork.\n\nCongratulations on finding work & I hope things go better for you in the future! Hope this perspective helps!"

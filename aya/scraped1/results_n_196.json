    "title": "Facing judgment of $32k (credit card debt) Just received a wage garnishment notice.. main concern though - are our IRAS safe?",
    "question": "I'm currently in the unfortunate situation of having my wages garnished due to a judgment. My wife and I have approximately $45,000 in our IRAs. Can these be subject to levies? I'm in the state of CA and I was reading about exemptions that allow enough money for the debtor to survive on once retired. Torn between having an attorney negotiate for an affordable settlement (doubt this) or file bankruptcy (last resort)",
    "answers": [
        "Your IRAs should be 'safe' and protected from garnishment/levy -- state & federal exemptions permit greater than $1M exemption per spouse for qualified retirement and IRA accounts.\n\nBankruptcy may be the superior option to debt settlement and it will certainly cost you less than what most creditors would accept on settlement of a $32,000 claim. That said, very likely you understand your family's financial situation best and what you hope to accomplish. If you explore settlement and unable to reach an agreement, I suggest looking more closely into bankruptcy protection and relief. In fact, may be wise to consider bankruptcy options alongside settlement options to reach a greater understanding of next steps.\n\nBest of luck!",

        "I urge you to seek guidance from an experience bankruptcy attorney in your area. Some of us offer half hour no charge initial consultation. It may be your best option to stop the garnishment. I don't know what other assets you have but on the face of it, your retirement accounts may be exempt - or protected should you file chapter 7. The creditor is really in charge right now, since the garnishment is in place. Perhaps when you received the lawsuit initially, you may have had some options regarding payment arrangements. The creditors knows what it can get from the garnishment so you may have to offer more than that as part of any attempt to settle with payments. Looking into bankruptcy doesn't push you into filing - it just provides all the information you need to make that decision. Good luck."

        "I agree with my colleagues on this matter. One point regarding reaffirmations of mortgages. If a Debtor is not behind and wishes to retain the house, a reaffirmation of that mortgage is often beneficial to the Debtor. Here's why: If you do not reaffirm, and continue to make payments, the credit agencies will not give you credit for the payments; Debtor's credit score will not reflect this credit history.\n\nKeeping a reaffirmed mortgage current can help Debtors rebuild their credit scores. If Debtors have the means to make the payments, and plan on staying, they should get credit for the payments they make. Rebuilding a Debtor's credit score after filing bankruptcy is often reason enough to reaffirm.",
        "Wikipedia is an unrelaible source for important information. There was a case about fifteen years ago decided by the Supreme Court which said that ipso facto clauses, otherwise known as default on filing a bankruptcy, were unenforceable because they were against public policy. In 2005 Congress specifically overruled that case's holding but only in regard to personal property so that now, if your car finance company has a default upon filing bankrutpcy clause in your finance contract, they can enforce it and repo your car. However, since Congress did not address whether we had to reaffirm mortgage contract while they specifically said we had to reaffirm debts for cars and other personal property, the courts have uniformly said that reaffirmation of mortgages for real property are not required and the mortgage company cannot foreclose just because you filed bankruptcy. So as long as you keep your payments current, they cannot foreclose. FYI, in many parts of the country , including where i practice in NC, our judges will not allow a reaffirmation for real property unless there is a substantial benefit to the debtor such as a interest rate or principal reduction. You should consult with a local bankruptcy attorney in your area, but I would be very surprised if they told you much different than what Mr. Doan and I have advised.",
        "Once you have obtained your bankruptcy discharge you are precluded from reaffirming the debt since it has now been discharged.\n\nUnder some circumstances, you may be able to have the discharge revoked as to the specific creditor for the purpose of entering into a reaffirmation agreement.\n\nHowever, you do NOT want to reaffirm a mortgage, especially in today's market. The original terms of your mortgage are still in effect, and as long as you continue your obligations under the note the lender will not and can not seek to foreclose.\n\nYou are most likely confusing personal property versus real property. With personal property, if you do not reaffirm and the contract contains an ipso facto clause (ie. filing bankruptcy is deemed a breach under the contract) then the lender can repo. Only a few will take such aggresive measures if you are current on your account.\n\nBest Wishes,\n\nSteve Doan, Esq"

    "question": "Parties have agreed a marital settlement agreement (MSA), signed and notarized it. Filling out final version of form FL 150 (A preliminary version was exchanged a few months ago at time of bifurcation). The MSA provides the opportunity for me to have a higher percentage of time with the child than what I have had till now.",
    "answers": [
        "Why are you submitting an FL-150? If you have an MSA and it contains child support provisions, then I don't understand the necessity of doing this. The fact of having in the past exchanged your PDD's that isn't necessarily relevant to the issue of child support and an FL-150. When you exchanged your PDD's you should have provided to the other party an FL-150. Just fill out the necessary FL-180 and supporting documents ( not necessarily needing another FL-150) and submit the MSA together with the other documents to the court for signing. If confused, go to the self -help center at your court house.",
        "I believe that your current agreement would go into an FL 150 if this is the finalized version.\n\nIf you look at 16b, there is a parenthetical portion that states \"If you are not sure about the percentage, OR IF IT HAS NOT BEEN AGREED UPON ....). You've agreed upon it.\n\nParagraph 20: Other information. This is where you would put in the note that you have agreed upon Child Support and begun making those payments as of whatever date you first made the payment(s).\n\nFurthermore, if your MSA includes important relevant information regarding the division of property and debts, then obviously you will file that with the FL 150. If it conveys real estate please use the proper Interspousal Grant Deed and make sure that you have searched all court records regarding any existing unsatisfied judgments, tax liens, etc.",
        "I agree with the response but I'd there are debts listed in the MSA which are assigned to one party or other list this on the schedule of assets and debts. Howver all of this should have been listed in the MSA. Best of luck."

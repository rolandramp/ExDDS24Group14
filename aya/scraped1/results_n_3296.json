    "title": "Can a late payment on a mortgage loan from a discharged Ch 7 BK be reported to credit bureau if debt was never reaffirmed?",
    "question": "This mortgage debt was part of Chapter 7 bankruptcy that was discharged in December of 2010. I have continued to make payments after the discharge. I have tried many times over the last four years to modify or refi loan but was always denied and have never signed any new contracts for reaffirmation, modification or refinancing. I have been one payment late for the last four months but as of today I am current on all payments. After becoming current on payments I was recently denied an FHA mortgage due to the late payments being reported to a credit bureau by my mortgage creditor. Is this legal to report this late payment to a credit bureau? Do I have any legal contract to pay this mortgage? If I continue to pay this mortgage off will I have an issue retaining title when paid in full?",

        "I concur with atty Spainhower. The mortgage company can be said to be in violation of the discharge injunction by reporting a delinquent payment on a loan note which has been discharged. By so doing, they are arguably \"attempting to collect a debt\".",
        "No, No, and No in order.\n\nSince your mortgage was discharged and not re-affirmed it is illegal for the creditor to attempt to collect the debt through the credit reporting system. All you need to do if that is the case is dispute the report to the credit reporting agency and they should remove it. However, this may not be what happened in your case because your new lender would have attempted to contact the old lender directly to get a payment history and that is what could have caused the problem, not necessarily the credit report.\n\nYou have no legal contract to pay the mortgage personally, but if the loan is not paid according to the contract the home can be foreclosed on.\n\nIF you pay off the loan, they will issue a re-conveyance of the deed of trust . It has no affect on the title or the deed that you have, just the lien created by the deed of trust.",
        "Agree with colleagues. My perspective is that reporting late payment after discharge is violation of permanent stay because it is an attempt to collect a debt. I know others disagree with this perspective.",
        "I am surprised that you appear to blame your lender for deciding not to provide you with special considerations after your bankruptcy. Offering you a loan modification is a privilege, not something you are entitled to get. If you want to surrender your property, talk to a realtor about selling. If you want a lower mortgage payment, talk to some other lenders. Hope this perspective helps."

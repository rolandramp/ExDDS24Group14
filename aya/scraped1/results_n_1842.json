    "title": "What value can a attorney provide in completing SF-86",
    "question": "SF 86 is the first step towards applying for security clearance. People may have old debts and other matters that may impact the chances to apply or obtain clearance. Can retaining an attorney help in any way for candidates who are about to apply ?",
    "answers": [
        "To answer the question directly - no, an attorney wouldn't help you when completing the SF-86. It's a form, not a hearing. If you are denied clearance, you can have a lawyer represent you in the administrative hearing to challenge the denial.",
        "The keys to a credible SF-86/eQIP submission are preparation and honesty. You must be accurate and tell the truth, even if it is not favorable. The SF-86 information will form the framework for the investigation so it is critical that it is accurate as the information contained will ultimately be squared with the result of the security investigation.\n\nThe failure to include a past reportable event is not as damaging to your adjudication as a current and purposeful omission or falsification. Simply stated, it’s worse to purposefully omit or falsify information to appear more favorable, then admit later that the information was known but not included. The investigation process is thorough and queries various record systems and databases so it is highly likely to uncover the falsification or omission.\n\nSometimes a yes or no answer is just not adequate to fully describe your situation. Do not interpret a question in such a way to enable you to provide a favorable response. If you are not certain of the answer or the answer is more complex than a simple “yes” or “no” or you have a question whether something should be listed, then include it and explain the details in the continuation area. An attorney, experienced in security clearance adjudications, cannot change the facts but can assist you to ensure that your responses are accurate and that any collateral information which is relevant is provided. Although your debts may be significant, an attorney can also assist you in developing strategies to mitigate their negative effect and, over time, develop a meaningful track record of debt reduction.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This response is for information purposes only, should not be interpreted to constitute legal advice and does not create an attorney client relationship. You should consult with an attorney for advice in your specific case."

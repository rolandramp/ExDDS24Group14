    "title": "What is the last day I can file a motion to lift stay in bankruptcy action?",
    "question": "I have filed an adversary complaint challenging dischargeability of a fraud judgment and asking the court to return the case to state court so that I can proceed with the writ and garnishment, but was told that I would probably have to file a motion to lift stay. The creditors claim file date is Monday and I need to know if I must file the motion prior to that date.",
    "answers": [
        "You have filed an adversary proceeding here, and not a proof of claim. If the debtor's case is a Chapter 7 case, you would litigate your adversary proceeding through a trial. If you try the adversary proceeding, and if the U.S. Bankruptcy judge rules that the debt is nondischargeable, you can collect this debt from the debtor after the discharge order is entered in the case. The discharge injunction then would not apply to your debt, and you would be free to resume collection activities in the state court. This is not a DIY project, though. You should hire an experienced bankruptcy attorney to represent you. If you lose your adversary proceeding, the debtor can recover costs and attorneys fees from you. The debtor can file a bill of costs against you if you lose the adversary case, and come after you to collect the costs and fees. This is a specialized area of the law, and bankruptcy courts take an independent view of fraud, and how a fraud judgment in a state court should be treated. Go get some advice from an experienced local bankruptcy attorney.",

        "No. I'm not sure what you mean by the \"creditors claim file date\".

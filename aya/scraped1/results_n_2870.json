    "answers": [
        "Yes. There do exist various SOL for different typrs of debts and obligations. CA SOL for regular judgments on debt is 10 years. Can be renewed for additional 10 years periods by creditor. SOL on federal and state taxes are complicated, fact spercific and depend on several factors, including, not limited to: type of tax, whether return filed, when return filed, when assessed, fraud, underlying basis for tax.\nConsult BK counsel.",
        "Franchise Tax Board SOL is technically 22 years but in reality there is no statute as they always find a reason to find that it is tolled. The IRS has ten years to assess you or renew - they occasionally drop the ball on this.",
        "In addition to what has already been said, tax liens will probably remain enforceable against any assets of tangible value. If there is nothing of tangible value, ask for an abatement of the lien once the paricular tax reaches the SOL mark.",
        "Most judgments good for 10 years and can be renewed for another 10. Family law related support judgments good indefinitely. 10 year SOL on some taxes, doesn't apply to fraud or tax evasion. A lot of taxes and judgments can be discharged in bankruptcy.\n\nRob",
        "Normal judgements must be renewed in 10 years. Family law judgments are \"evergreen.\" The government never goes away--they're the government."

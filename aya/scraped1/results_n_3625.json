    "title": "After one spouse gets a discharge, can their wages be garnished if the other spouse did not get a discharge in California?",
    "question": "Me and my wife filed a personal chapter 7 to get out from some debt that carried over from my failed business. The judge discharged the debt from my wife, but I did not personally get a discharge. Now, the creditor has attained a garnishment order against my wife's income citing it is community property even though she has personally received a discharge for this debt. I am being told conflicting things from different attorney's. Most attorney's tell me I should have my wife file for sanctions against the creditor, but my own attorney is saying that they may have a legitimate claim. It seems to me that precedent supports my wife's protection. My attorney just doesn't seem like he really knows this part of the law.",

        "I believe your case involves one of the rarely used or cited sections of the Bankruptcy Code which is 11 USC 524(a)(3), (b). That section will provide that the discharge does not operate as an injunction againt community property IF the debtors spouse is in fact also a debtor and the court did not grant the debtor's spouse a discharge 524(b)(1). In light of that , I believe your attorney is correct and in fact knows \"this part of the law\". This law comes up at our bankruptcy seminars ever so often and may at the seminar we have this Friday in Seattle Wa!! And if I am wrong, I hope to hear about why too as I learn on here also!",
        "From the facts you provide, the wife's wages cannot be garnished for a debt that was discharged in her BK. If her husband was a joint judgment debtor, his wages are liable for levy.",
        "I think you need to talk to another lawyer and get a 2nd opinion.\n\nCalifornia has a unique Community Property exemption scheme whereby once one spouse lists all community debt and individual debt, the discharge effectively prohibits a creditor from garnishing wages which are community property.\n\nIn effect the community property sails through the discharge and is now exempt from future garnishment or levy.\n\nThe cases are In re Kimmel, 367 B.R. 174 (9th Cir 2007) citing Costanza:\n\n\"In re Costanza, 151 B.R. 588, 589-90 (Bankr.D.N.M.1993):\nThe discharge received by [wife] provides her a fresh start.

For those who wish to pursue the matter, there may be no better source than the article written by Alan Pedlar, Community Property and the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978, 11 St. Mary's L.J. 349 (1979) [\"Pedlar, Community Property \"]. The article suggests the possibility that \"the Devil himself could effectively receive a discharge in bankruptcy if he were married to Snow White.\" Id. at 382.

        "You may want to re-post this question with the following information:\n1. What loans were outstanding on the home when the foreclosure occurred (i.e., the primary mortgage, second mortgage, home equity loan;\n2. Which lender is currently demanding payment;\n3. Did that lender sue the homeowner/borrower to obtain a judgment for the amount owed;\n4. If no lawsuit was filed, what has the collection agent done or said that makes you believe that a college savings fund can be attached or levied in satisfaction of the debt.",
        "Do not believe anything that a debt collector tells you, especially if it involves your legal rights. Before a debt collector can levy upon any asset, it must obtain a court judgment. This means that you will be served with a lawsuit. If you file an Answer, rather than allowing a default judgment to be entered, the court will set a trial date about a year away. If they prove their case with proper, admissible, evidence, the creditor can levy upon non-exempt assets. You can file a Claim of Exemption. Whether your particular 529 may be exempt under some statute, is an issue requiring that an attorney review the actual documents and your other assets. I strongly urge you not to pull money out of the 529 unless you talk to your tax advisor and consider the calculate the penalties and taxes involved.",
        "The question need to be clarified. The collection agency is asking you to pay a debt from a college saving account? or did the collection agency actually levied a college saving account?\nIn order to take collection actions against you, such as a bank levy, the collection agency or the original creditor must first obtain a judgment against you and then obtain a writ of execution from the Court. It is not clear whether there is a judgment against you. If the collection agency is just talking to you without having a judgment, than you better not talk to them and consider sending them a cease and desist letter, to stop their calls and letters.\nIf there is a judgment against you and the creditor is attempting to levy a college fund, you may wish to talk to a local bankruptcy attorney. Bankruptcy Code section 541(b)(6) exclude from the bankruptcy estate college saving account monies exempted under IRS Code 529, provided that the funds invested in the account were contributed more than 365 days prior to the filing of the bankruptcy. Additional exemptions may apply.\nI strongly suggest that you consult with a local debt collection defense/bankruptcy attorney in this matter. Most attorneys provide some type of a free limited initial consultation.",

        "How is the creditor listed on your plan? Typically the debt is listed as unsecured because these is no note describing it otherwise. The lien is a judicial lien and if it impairs your exemption, then it can be stripped off by motion. If you filed your case with an attorney, talk to your attorney. If not, seek the advice of competent local counsel",
        "The answer depends upon whether or not an Anstract of Judgment was recorded. The judgment is an unsecured claim, unless the judgment creditor recorded a lien on real property or secured a lien on some other property in accordance with the law of the state where the debtor’s property is located (an involuntary secured claim). In other words, the creditor has to take one step further to turn a judgment into a lien. Recording a lien is called \"perfecting the lien\".",
        "I have to disagree with the other answers a bit. A judgment is not a secured debt. It can become one, but it is not by itself. A judgment is merely a court order obligating the payment of a certain amount.\n\nIf the judgment creditor you reference has recorded an abstract of the judgment against your property, then that lien is obviously secured against your property.\n\nDepending on what homestead exemption you are entitled to (assuming you are living in the property), you should be able to avoid some or possibly all of the lien in your Chapter 13 case.\n\nIf you're trying to handle this Chapter 13 case yourself, don't.

        "If currently in a Chapter 13 case, several options may be available regarding handling the judgment recorded as lien against your primary residence.

        "A judgement is a secured debt. However is some cases the lien can be avoided by filing a special motion to avoid the lien. In many cases we are able to avoid judgments in code section 522 , which converts them to unsecured debt, and they would be paid the same dividend as the rest of the general unsecured creditors. However if you in an \"extension plan\" meaning your are paying 100% to your unsecured creditors then avoiding the lien would not likely reduce your payments."

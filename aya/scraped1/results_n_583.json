    "title": "Chapter 7 bankruptcy. What happens where I'm on title to home along w/ relative. They pay & live there. I helped w/ loan/credit?",
    "question": "So, what happens in a situation where I am listed as half owner on my brother's home. He and his family live there (out of state) and they paid the down payment and all payments thereafter. I just went on the loan a couple of years back to help him to qualify for the purchase. As a result I am listed as a 50% owner. They have about $80 in equity.",
    "answers": [
        "Honestly, if the equity (value minus liens) is 80k, your interest (after costs of sale) would be half of the remaining equity, most of which can be exempted with your wildcard (assuming you don't have other assets at risk). A trustee is not likely to try to sell a house in another state for the few thousand dollars he might net.\nBut if he does, you can still use the doctrines of resulting trust and bare legal (not equitable) title to schedule your interest in the house at zero (which you should do first anyway).\nIf all else fails, you can convert to Ch13 for little or no additional funds up front.",
        "Your question was not clear as to whether you intend to file bankruptcy or not, but presuming you are, Chapter 7 might not permit you to exempt your 1/2 interest, in which case the trustee can sell it to pay your debts, so best you seek advise from an experienced bankruptcy and perhaps you may need to consider a Chapter 13.",
        "If you can prove you have provided absolutely nothing towards the real estate you might be able to convince a chapter 7 trustee that you have no real interest, but that may depend upon the trustee. Your safest option is probably a chapter 13, but you need to hire your own attorney to review all the facts before making an irrevocable decision.",
        "A Chapter 13 would protect the asset, providing you meet the \"Best interest of creditors test\" which essentially pays back your debt a sum equal to an amount creditors would receive in a hypothetical chapter 7 case. Your exempt assets would be determined by the applicable exemption scheme that is best suited for your particular situation. This would depend on the type of assets you own. Other criteria would be Means Test Calculations nd income and expense analysis. Consult with a local bankruptcy attorney in your area. Most BK attorneys give free consultations.",
        "If you are on the loan as 50% owner then 1/2 of the equity is attributable to you. You likely do not want to file chapter 7 and hopefully you have not already. Since you do not live there you cannot use the homestead exemption, that leaves the wildcard exemption which can only protect about $28k. If your assessment of value is correct then you probably cannot file chapter 7 without the trustee moving to sell the property, and I'm assuming your family wants to keep it. Speak with an experienced bankruptcy attorney about your situation. Chapter 13 may be a good option for you."

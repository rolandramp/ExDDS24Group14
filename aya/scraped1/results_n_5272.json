    "title": "My ex filed a Motion to Quash a Writ of Execution.",
    "question": "Ex filed a motion to quash a Writ of Execution for a monetary judgment in a family law case. However, the Judge made an order that he cannot re-file on the same case without first getting permission from the court. Ex filed a Set-Aside and it was denied and the judge made the order to get permission from the court before filing. He just filed another order on the same case. How do I let the court know? Do I have to go to the hearing?",

        "Disclaimer: The materials provided below are informational and should not be relied upon as legal advice.\n\nI am not clear based on your description what exactly you mean that \"the Judge made an order that he cannot re-file on the same case without first getting permission from the court.\" You need to read the Court order carefully and determine what it means. My guess would be the either Section 1008 or Sections 391, et seq., of the California Code of Civil Procedure (see links below). Section 1008 relates to motions for reconsideration, and Sections 391, et. seq., relate to any self-represented person who brings meritless pleadings before the court. Be sure to consult your own attorney to protect your legal rights.",
        "Same court and judge or a different judge?\n\nFile written opposition, and attach a copy of the prior order. Also, request sanctions in your opposition. The judge will probably not award sanctions, unless your ex really gets the judge angry, so do not expect that you will receive anything.",
        "Unfortunately, if you ignore even a motion which does not have merit, you run the risk of losing. You cannot ignore any motion filed by the opposition, and you will need to file a response. Sometimes, judges will pick up what your opposition would have been even if you do not file a written response, and show up in court at the hearing, but other judges will assume that if you do not file a written opposition and do not appear at the hearing, that you do not oppose the motion, and they will grant it. Therefore, you will need to file a response. Alternatively, you could attempt to bring a motion to strike the motion your ex has brought because he did not obtain leave. Finally, you may also wish to call the court clerk and advise her that this motion has been filed, and explain the circumstances and see if she is helpful. However, even if the clerk says something that leads you to believe the motion will not be considered, until you actually see a confirmation that the motion will not proceed, you need to be ready to timely file an opposition."

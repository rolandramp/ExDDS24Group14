        "Have you already paid $3500? Or are you still \"shopping\" for a lawyer? Fees between a lawyer and client are negotiable.

        "That fee is higher than typically charged for a consumer bankruptcy, but it does not sound unreasonable for a bankruptcy that involves \"a lot of businesses\".",
        "There is not necessarily a maximum, however, the attorney must disclose how much he/she was paid and if it an unreasonable amount then the trustee is going to question that amount. $3,500 is slightly on the higher end, however, it does not necessarily rise to the level of too high. If the attorney foresees a lot of issues then it might be a reasonable price. I would recommend that person call a couple experienced bankruptcy attorneys (can be found on this website) and consult with a couple and obtain quotes from them, that way they can at least compare a couple of attorneys."

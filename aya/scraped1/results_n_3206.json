    "answers": [
        "Prior to the change in the banruptcy laws in 2005 a person could keep their car after a bankruptcy discharge by making the required monthly payments. This was called a \"ride trhough.\"\n\nThe post 2005 Bankruptcy Code takes away the \"ride through\" option. A debtor must either redeem the car (that means pay the fair market value of the car in a lump sum) , or surrender the car to the lender or reaffirm the debt. If the debtor does not reaffirm or redeem the vehicle but he is current with his payments the lender can still repossess the car. Some lenders, especially Ford, were very agressive about enforcing this provision. Even if payments were current, if the debt on the car had not been reaffirmed, then Ford and others were repossessing cars.\n\nTo reaffirm the debt on the car you will have to become current with your payments, then sign a reaffirmation agreement that says that you are keeping the car and will make all payments under the contract.\n\nTalk to the bankruptcy department of your lender. See if they will work with you concerning the missed payments. They would rather get the payment stream than take the car back and have to sell it to a wholesaler for a possible loss.",
        "If you are behind in payments after you receive your discharge, the lender can repossess the vehicle which is a substantial risk, especially if you have entered into a Reaffirmation Agreement with the lender, as the lender could also sue you for the deficiency on the vehicle. While the bankruptcy is pending, possibly in conjunction with the reaffirmation of the loan, your attorney may be able to negotiate having the missed payments added to the end of the loan or otherwise have the loan deemed current. After your discharge, you can also do the same and if you are not successful, should get the payments caught up as soon as possible.",
        "Think of your car loan like a home mortgage. The lender has two types of rights aganist you:\n1. The right to collect the payments. (similar to mortage payments)\n2. The right to take the car away from you if you do not pay.(similar to foreclosure proceedings)\nYou will indeed receive a Discharge on the car loan, but the lender would still have the right to take the car away from you. This will occur at the end of your chapter 7 case, but during the case you will be protected by the Automatic Stay. The lender can ask the court, by motion, to remove the stay during the case. The question you have to answer, is do you really want to keep this car, If you do then you should consider a reaffirmation agreement with the lender. You will then need to be current on all payments on the car, if you want to keep it. However, remember you can surrender the car and receive the Discharge resulting in no further payments to this creditor.",
        "You are going to file bankruptcy not have filed. Based on that if you default on payments the creditor can repossess at any time. Once you have there is a 342 stay of all actions which prevents creditors from repossessing unless they file a motion for relief from the stay. All in all even filing of the chapter 7 only protects your car for a little while unless your current or come current soon. This process discharges unsecured debt not secured. If the car is \"underwater\" you may consider letting it go, the deficiency amount in repossession will be discharged. And your credit may be better than you assume. Check with financing at car dealers. And you really should retain counsel if you haven't . Best of luck",
        "You can keep your car, however, you will need to make up all payments you missed before your bankruptcy is over or if the lender files a motion for relief from stay (release from protection of your BK) during your BK. The short answer is if you miss a payment or two you will need to make up those payments along with the associated late fees, penalties, etc. in order to become current and keep the vehicle. It is generally not a good idea to miss a payment if you intend on keeping the car.",
        "The short answer is yes; they can. It just depends on several factors. Talk to your lawyer. I'm sure that missing payments and risking losing your car isn't the only way to pay for counsel. Good luck.",
        "The car can be repod immediately. BUt they must find it. Store it in garage, trade with a friend..but the debt will be discharged in bankruptcy. You want to keep it but what is the value vs the $ owed on it? PS Have a great night..order all 3 of your credit reports post bankruptcy and make sure they all state \"zero balance, discharged in bankruptcy\" unless it is a non dischargeable type debt. Good luck.",
        "Yes, the lender can repo your car in that scenario. You would be in default of your obligations to the lender on at least two bases: 1) the automatic default upon filing of a Chapter 7 which is contained in most car finance contracts, and 2) due to the fact ath you have not made some number of payments called for by the contract. The strategy you are contemplating is very risky and I suspect will end up with your car being repo'ed. The good thing would be that they could not come after you for a deficiency, assuming you have not reaffirmed the car loan in your Ch7.",
        "I agree with attorney Kuhn in terms of the ability of the lien holder to repossess the car.\n\nAdditionally, if your intent is to keep the car, you can complete a reaffirmation agreement to reaffirm the debt. When doing so, you can often negotiate an agreement with the creditor to include any unpaid amounts so that you begin anew with the new agreement and are no longer in arrears. Keep in mind that if you do so, the debt is no longer discharged in the bankruptcy and you must pay or risk repossession (and still owe the debt).\n\nYou should seek out an attorney to assist and advise you on your personal situation, and to ensure everything is done right.",
        "If you do not pay for the car during the case or are in arrears at the time the case is filed, then the lender can file a Motion for Relief with the Court asking to proceed against the collateral and take the vehicle. Once the case is over, the car lender can repo the vehicle if you are in arrears but cannot come after you for the deficiency provided you did not reaffirm the debt."

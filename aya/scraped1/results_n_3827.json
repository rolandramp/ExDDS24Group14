    "title": "Amended petition does not reflect community/separate assets/debts. Can I add FL 160 when filing for default?",
    "question": "I filed for divorce in July and amended the petition in Jan. My spouse was served and I am currently filing for default. In the amended petition I checked the box stating there were no assets or debts that needed to be divided. However, I currently would like to add an FL160 showing community and separate debts (with no assets). Would I need to amend the FL 100 again, or can I file an FL 160 with my current default documents?",
    "answers": [
        "The default will not include your property since you did not include that on the amended petition and you did not disclose that to the opposing party. You must file the FL-160 and serve that and then wait another 30 days before filing the request for default. I also suggest that you serve opposing party an FL-142 along with your current income and expense declaration. You can file the FL-160 with your default papers but it won't be included in your default. You may have to go back and seek approval from the court to file a second amended petition to include the property issues."

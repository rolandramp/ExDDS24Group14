    "title": "Can a heloc lien be removed after chapter 7 discharge?",
    "question": "We filed bankruptcy last year and it was discharged in Nov of last year, included in the bk was our heloc. Since that time the lender has continually called and harrassed and threated us with forclosure to make payments on the discharged debt. We have made a few payments so that they stop calling. Is it now possible to remove the lien from title.",
    "answers": [
        "If your real estate is worth less than the balance on your 1st mortgage, it is highly unlikely that the 2nd mortgage would foreclose. You might be able to remove the lien by offering a lump sum cash settlement in that particular circumstances. If I am describing your circumstances, then save your money & see if your bankruptcy attorney can help you obtain a settlement.\n\nIf your first mortgage is not larger than the value of your property, if you want to keep the property, sooner or later you have to pay the second. If you don't pay, they can foreclose, and if you have equity in the property, they may do just that. However, the harassment is not ok and you should contact your bankruptcy attorney to have this harassment stop.\n\nHope this perspective helps!",
        "Mr. Torres is correct. Contact your bankruptcy attorney regarding addressing the harassing calls. However, removing the lien is not possible in a Chapter 7. It may be possible in a Chapter 13. Speak with your attorney about that also.",
        "Contrary to my colleagues statement - a HELOC is dischargeable. The issue you are running into is regarding the deed of trust which remains recorded against the property. Unfortunately a Chapter 7 does not provide for lien stripping. A chapter 13 would have provided a lien strip and may still be an option (but courts are split on whether a 13 following a 7 can provide the debtor with a lien strip notwithstanding a discharge in the 2nd case).\n\nThe lender should not be attempting to collect a discharged debt- if the lender is in fact attempting to collect on a discharged debt you may have an action for civil contempt damages, injunctive relief, monetary relief, sanction, etc.\n\nI'd be happy to speak with you regarding the issues at your convenience.",
        "Generally the HELOC i non-dischargeaable and is secured debt."

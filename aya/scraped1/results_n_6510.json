    "title": "Filing chapter 7. spouse is not filing. car and auto loan in her name. Can I list that and take the owner credit on means test ?",
    "question": "Also, in addition to taking the ownership credit, since I have listed both of our incomes, can I list 2 cars for ownership and 2 for operating expense. The other car would be under the $200 clunker allowance as it is paid off and old.",
    "answers": [
        "I know in our region that a Debtor is allowed a $200 deduction on the means test if the car is 6+ years or over 60,000 miles, but the total deduction is capped at $300 if both cars fit that category. It sounds like the CA UST's office may take that approach as well. But there are so many other potential land mines in doing a long form means test that you can get your case dismissed. All of this wrapped up into a case with non-filing spouse is enough to make a seasoned bankruptcy attorney work extra hard.\n\nIf you truly believe that you can't afford an attorney, then try your best. Worst case scenario is that your case gets dismissed and you have to refile again.\n\nAnd the other attorney is right, you can only take an ownership expense on the car with the loan. The free and clear car only gets an operating expense deduction with the $200 \"extra\".",
        "Title, ownership, prior transmutation are all questions that should be considered in how bankruptcy affects the filing spouse and the non-filing spouse. There is a great temptation to \"put down\" everything and overload, but you will feel the displeasure of the trustee if you go to far.",
        "It's a foolish thing to try and file bankruptcy without an attorney and using a \"paralegal friend\" is just the type of dangerous thinking I see from time to time that sinks a lot of people's cases. If you hired a lawyer, he or she would tell you that there is a United States Supreme Court decision called Ransom that decided that a debtor cannot take an ownership expense for a car that is \"paid off and old.\" If you're over median, you can, and should, hire an attorney. Save the money up to get your case done right and stop the guessing game. It could end up pretty ugly, especially if you file a pro se Chapter 7 and you end up not qualifying."

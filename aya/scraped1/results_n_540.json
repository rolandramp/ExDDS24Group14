    "title": "Assuming a lease in bankruptcy, making stipulations, extending the 30 day stay ?",
    "question": "I am having some issues in a chapter 7 bankruptcy where my landlord wants relief from the stay of the bankruptcy. This motion is actually being head after the first 30 days but before the unlawful detainer trial date. I would like to extend the stay, even though I may not have rent payment available by then based on that I do believe the pay rent or quit norice was waived when the landlord offered a lease extension to me after the notice was served and not paid , among other reasons regarding the amount stated on the notice.",

        "There are a lot of different parts to your question. I recommend speaking with your attorney for your chapter 7, and if you do not have one I recommend calling a couple experienced bankruptcy attorneys. From your recitation of the facts it seems like the Court may grant your landlord's motion for relief from stay if you are behind on rent in order to allow the UD trial to move forward. Your automatic stay goes beyond 30 days unless you have had more than one bankruptcy pending in the last year. You are always free to stipulate to something with the landlord, if they are agreeable. In my experience, you will need to go to your UD trial and probably negotiate a time to move out. Any rent that came due before your petition was filed will be dischargeable in your Chapter 7. Hope this helps.",

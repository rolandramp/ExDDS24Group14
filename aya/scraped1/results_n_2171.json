    "title": "Will a debt be discharged if it is paid outside a chapter 13 plan?",
    "question": "I recently bought a car and it has 5 years of payments on it. I spoke to an attorney who said that I qualify for a 3 yr chapter 13 plan and that I should pay the lender directly. My question is if I file a bankruptcy and pay the lender directly, will the debt on the car be discharged? Will there be any way I can keep the car once the bankruptcy is over?",
    "answers": [
        "Your plan should provide for either the assumption the vehicle purchase contract or the rejection of the contract and the surrender of the vehicle to the secured creditor. If your plan assumes the contract, you thereby bind yourself to the contract and the discharge is waived. If your plan rejects the contract and provides for the surrender of the vehicle, then you would receive a discharge of that debt at the end of your plan. If you assume the contact but later your circumstances change during the period when your plan is pending, then you should speak with an attorney about your options for modifying your plan.",
        "Just keep making the payments outside the Plan and you will be able to keep the vehicle. The car debt will not be discharged.",
        "If you stay current on your direct car payments to the lender through the 5 years, you will be able to keep the car. However, the secured debt will not be discharged by the bankruptcy.\n\nIf you surrender the car, the debt will become unsecured. Completing your 3 years of bankruptcy plan payments (if you do in fact qualify for that term) would discharge the portion of your unsecured debt pursuant to your chapter 13 plan.\n\nIn other words, if you wish to keep the car, you have to pay for it.",
        "Long term debts that are owed for specific assets for which the last payment is due after the plan is scheduled to end are not discharged in a Ch13, so if you have a plan that is set to last 3 years and your vehicle debt is set to last 5 years, then the debt for the vehicle will not be discharged. Even though you qualify for a 3 year plan, you may still want to include the debt for the car depending on how much interest you are paying for the car. If you are paying a high interest rate for the car it may be worth including the car in your plan due to the reduced interest rates that are typically paid in a Ch13 plan. Discuss this with your lawyer.",
        "If you're not in default of your auto loan, the car is paid outside of the plan.\n\nIt stands to reason your debt will not be discharged for the car.",
        "If you wish to keep the car you will also have to provide for direct payments outside the plan and the debt will not be discharged when you receive you discharge as the payments overlap the three years and the plan provides as such. Otherwise you have the choice of returning the car and discharging any deficiency over three years. You are not entitled to modify the loan amount as you only recently purchased the car."

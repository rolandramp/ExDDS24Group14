    "title": "Tax liability on a rental property foreclosure?",
    "question": "My husband and I own a home in California that was our primary residence until 4 months ago. We now have renters, and own another home as our primary residence. We have a 1st mortgage (non-recourse) of $223k and a 2nd mortgage that we refinanced a year after we purchased the home, did not take any money out, just refinanced from a HELOC to a fixed loan to lower the rate. We owe about $50k on the 2nd. The home's FMV is about $190k is my guess, and we owe a total of $273k between the 2 loans. What is the tax implications if we foreclose on it? My understanding is we'd have ordinary income tax on the difference between FMV and the loan amount owed, plus potentially owe the $50k if the 2nd mortgager chooses to collect on it?",

        "I recommend you get the rental property appraised; if the appraised value is not more than $223,000 that you owe on the first, consider whether a Chapter 13 bankruptcy might improve your financial situation by enabling you to remove that second mortgage lien. Then you would just be obligated to pay the first on that property. Talk to a bankruptcy attorney in your area. In addition to what the other attorneys have said, I would also point out that in some situations there can also be a capital gains tax liability resulting from a foreclosure sale and surrendering the property in bankruptcy will not prevent that.",
        "The difference in the proceeds from a sales foreclosure and the total amount you owe on the debts will be considered forgiveness of debt income. Technically, the bank or institution holding the note is the one who forecloses. If you sell the house in short sale for less than the amount of the debt and the debt is then cancelled then the treatment will be similar to a forced foreclosure sale by the bank. Also, note your credit will get hurt by taking a foreclosure. You can potentially negotiate what is called a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure with the bank. The bank take the house and deed and discharges the debt, but you still have income to the extent of forgiven debt. Bankruptcy is about the only way you can get around recognizing some of the debt forgiveness as income, but that is a very complex process and more damaging to your credit than the other options mentioned. I would sit down with an attorney who does a significant amount of real estate and foreclosure work. The differences are important, but the financial hit will in all likelihood be the close to the same as far as income recognition. The ancillary consequences are what you have the most control over (ie, how much damage to your credit from each option, etc). Good luck, you are in a tough financial position and each way out of this without paying the note off will cause you to have to suffer certain consequences.",
        "Generally, the mortgage company will issue a 1099 for the amount of the mortgage debt forgiven. This amount must be reported to the IRS. There are some exceptions to paying tax on the 1099 amount (sounds like at least one of the exceptions may apply). You should consult with a knowledgeable tax preparer/CPA to take advantage of any exceptions that may apply.\n\nI hope this helps.\nRespectfully,\nSteven A. Leahy\nwww.chicagotaxteam.com",
        "Based on the facts provided and my understanding of them there will be no ordinary income and no deficiency because all the debt is now non-recourse debt in CA. Happy New Year. You should hire a tax lawyer to explain it to you."

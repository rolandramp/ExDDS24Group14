        "It is possible to exempt up to $175K in home equity. If your home is valued at $560K you deduct the amounts owed on it (1st-2nd TDs, etc) to find the amount of equity. If the equity exceeds $175K you might have to pay something to the trustee to keep the home. BK is not a DIY project. Find/consult/hire an Avvo atty by clicking the tab \"Find a Lawyer\". Many in your area offer a free consultation. Talk with 2 or 3 to learn your options.",
        "You have many options ahead of you, and not all involve bankruptcy. You should consult with an attorney to discuss your personal situation, which would be much more fruitful than asking on Avvo.com, where you can expect answers to more generic problems."

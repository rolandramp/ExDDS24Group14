        "If the source of the funds for the annuity was community property, then the annuity is community property. But if the source of the funds for the annuity came from your sole and separate property, then the annuity might be considered to be your sole and separate property, which you would not have to divide up with your spouse. To be sure about whether this annuity is community property or someone's sole and separate property, you do well to have a consultation with an EXPERIENCED attorney who will look carefully at the FACTS first, and then can give you the legal advice you truly need. For further comments I have made herein, please see my comments below Attorney Straus's answer and below Attorney Benton's answer.",

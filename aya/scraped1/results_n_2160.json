    "title": "Is there any due process EDD has to follow before they levy/garnish a bank account or can they just make and change the rules?",
    "question": "I never find out anything until the funds are removed from my account. I have never received a certified or general postage letter. When I have asked EDD for a copy of the law or code in which they are given unlimited ability to access my bank account they change the subject.",

        "Absent what Richard said about I.D. theft, or being the wrong person...your rights were triggered when they sent you that first notice saying \"hey, we overpaid you and we want our money back.\" If you didn't deal with it at that point, garnishment is the natural consequence. Not clear what \"due process\" rights you think you might have.\n\nNow, if you never received EDD benefits, that is a different issue, but if you knew there was a balance due and did nothing, you already failed to exercise your rights.",
        "EDD can garnish wages to repay overpayments for unemployment, taxes, child support, you name it.\n\nIf you feel EDD is reclaiming unemployment benefits that they errantly paid to you, or if you owe premiums for EDD, then there should've been a letter or notice sent to you notifying you of the reasons why you owe them money, and an outline of all the administrative procedures you must go through to appeal their decision. Also, do you owe child support?\n\nIf you can prove they have been sending notices to the wrong address, or they have the wrong person, or you're the victim of identity theft, then it may require more action on your part.\n\nTypically you need to follow the procedures that are directed to an Earnings Withholding Order .\n\nHere's my suggestion. Send a demand letter requesting a review of your entire file. Then determine if they served notice to the wrong person, wrong address, etc.\n\nIf they did not properly serve you there may be a chance at vacating it. You may have to file a request or appeal it.

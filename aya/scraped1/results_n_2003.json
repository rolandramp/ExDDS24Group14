    "title": "How do I escape paying for a 2nd frivolous appeal that a bankruptcy debtor keeps filing and naming me as the appellee?",
    "question": "I am a creditor in a bankruptcy case that was closed at end of February this year. I am owed $500K. The debtor's discharge was denied as a result of fraud and this was due to the trustee and I filing an adversary proceeding and being granted a summary judgment. The debtor has appealed this decision in a local district court and LOST. I paid to defend this frivolous action. And this month has filed yet another frivolous appeal to the circuit court. I have already spent many tens of thousands of dollars for the adversary proceeding and the first appeal. There are other creditors that are owed large sums. Should I reach out to them to split the bill, or how can I convince the circuit court that this is waste of court resources?",

        "I agree with the prior answers - there is no way to stop another party from appealing. They have fundamental right to seek appellate review.\n\nHowever, since this is the second appeal, your attorney could try a motion for summary affirmance. This is a procedural motion made with the appeals court where you present the argument that the appeal is meritless for some reason. In your case, point out there was a prior appeal and this is just a delay tactic. These can be resolved in as little as 30 days, so no more waiting. But these types of motions are very, very difficult to get. But might be worth a shot if the other side is behaving this way.\n\nAlso, start enforcing the judgment against the debtor. Record a copy of the judgment in the county where they live or have property, make a UCC filing with the secretary of state, get a writ of execution. Start taking money and property and pretty soon they are going to call you and want to reach a settlement.\n\nFeedback is important to all of the attorneys on Avvo as it is the only way we know whether our answers were effective in resolving your question.

        "If the appeal is determined to be frivolous, you should be able to receive an award of costs as described by Mr. Primus. However, your chance of recovering the costs is probably small since you are owed $500K already. Since your attorney has already briefed the matter thoroughly at the lower levels, the expense should be less at this stage. Hope you are able to recover some of your losses in the future.",
        "A losing party has the right to appeal an adverse decision to a higher court. Unfortunately, you will have to incur the cost of defending that appeal. Just remember, that the cost of the appeal is limited to the preparation of the pleadings and appearance in the Circuit Court. I know that is minor consolation but the fees should be less than the district court appeal. If you prevail, it is unlikely that the debtor will try to bring the appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nAs for defraying legal expenses, I recommend against it - you are paying your attorney to represent you. If others contribute funds, it could create an attorney/client relationship. And then what happens if the appeal is reversed or remanded?

        "Speak to your attorney on (1) whether and how you can request additional attorney fees; (2) whether your claim is stayed right now or if you can proceed to garnish; (3) a person can keep \"climbing the ladder\" on appeal if they want. In February of this year I just had the student loan debt of a client that I won at trial in bankruptcy court, was reversed by District Court Judge in Seattle on appeal, and the 9th Cir Court of Appeals just reversed and reinstated the discharge I won at trial when they issued their ruling in February! So...sometimes an upper court makes reversals if the laws are not correctly applied. In your case, you believe not only it was but an appeal is frivolous..but the appellant may believe differently. Your attorney can answer the above questions in case you can garnish right now any possible wages, etc..as possibly the debtor had to post a bond, etc..to cause the stay to continue? ask your attorney on those issues! Good Luck..It costs money to handle those appeals no doubt."

    "question": "Involving a judgement from a personal credit card debt, which is not part of my LLC, I was asked for all my bank accounts and past property transactions in a debtor's exam.",
    "answers": [
        "Since the LLC is owned/controlled by you, it is a likely subject of interest by a creditor. Its bank records would show deposits. Unless it is named as a judgment debtor, the bank used by the LLC it is not likely to be subject to levy.",
        "You must answer the questions and tell the truth. The creditor is entitled to learn about your financial circumstances, even if that information will not help them.",
        "If you are worried that they may be going after the LLC, you should consider hiring a lawyer to help resolve this situation.\n\nThey are asking because your ownership interest of the LLC is an asset.",
        "Did you also receive a subpoena for records (\"Subpoena duces tecum\")?\n\nIf so, it is likely to have specific instructions as to what information and documents you should bring to the exam.\n\nThe short answer is the creditor can ask some questions about the LLC. The creditor has a right to know if you are commingling your personal finances with the LLC's, and he or she can ask questions to determine the value of your LLC shares or interests.\n\nBeyond that, an attorney could argue the LLC's financials are beyond the scope of the debtor's exam.\n\nAll of the above assumes this is a valid LLC in good standing the the Secretary of State, duly registered to perform its business transactions, with a separate tax ID number, etc."

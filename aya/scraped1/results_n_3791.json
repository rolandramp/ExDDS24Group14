        "You must include all of your debts, including the debt owed to the payday loan creditor, in your bankruptcy case. You should consult a bankruptcy attorney if you have questions regarding whether or not the payday loan is dischargeable - if the loan was taken out within the last 90 days then there could be a presumption of non-dischargeability. If it was an older payday loan (like most), then the debt is likely dischargeable along with your other unsecured debts.\n\nRegarding the creditor calls - you are protected by the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and the California Rosenthal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. It is not clear from the facts whether a violation has occurred. However, many bankruptcy attorneys, once retained, will represent you in the interim for the purposes of creditor contact. You may be able to refer these creditors to your attorney while you prepare your bankruptcy documents. If a creditor is a debt collection who knowingly contacts a represented party for the purposes of collecting a consumer debt, the creditor could be in violation of debt collection law. Certain other harassing acts done to embarrass the debtor are also violations. Consider requesting a free yearly credit report and talking with a consumer debt attorney. Make sure to discuss the facts with them before you file a bankruptcy - any potential cause of action or unliquidated claim must be listed under Schedule B of your bankruptcy petition as an asset.",
        "First, you have the DUTY to list any and all debts in a bankruptcy or else you are committing perjury if you intentionally leave one off. You can only use your (1) brains, (2) your bills, and (3) your credit reports..thats all anyone can do. But, if you do leave some creditor off mistakenly, unless it is a nondischargeable type of debt, it still will be discharged in a ch 7 case! Once you file, the court will send a notice to all creditors and then they know to stop those calls you want stopped. Thus, the sooner the better. If you want, just tell your family members that you are filing bankruptcy if you want to and to ignore any creditor calls. Then, go find an attorney that only practices bankruptcy for a living. Although you really only have 2 goals (to discharge all your debts and to keep all assets you have equity in), there are other issues an attorney must go through in your case to make they do not affect or or what to do about them! You may state in writing to that specific creditor that you are filing bankruptcy shortly and they will receive a notice but that might not stop any calls. Good luck.",

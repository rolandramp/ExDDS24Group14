Or just every bit of profit the corp made including my paycheck? Please provide some insight.",

Does the corporation debit card get used to pay your personal expenses, like a fill up of your personal vehicle at Arco or to buy breakfast at Norms that can't be supported by IRS business use? The term for this is called \"piercing the corporate veil.\" The better you manage your books, the better your chance of having just your pay be your Sch J and Means test income.

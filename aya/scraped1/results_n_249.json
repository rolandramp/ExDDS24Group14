    "title": "Question about bail bond money owed and bankruptcy?",
    "question": "If my mom and her friend owe a bail bondsman money (a $17,000 premium) and my mom files for bankruptcy, will the entirety of the money owed fall upon her friend? Or what else might happen? She put her house up as collateral when they bailed him out and the case has since concluded with him being found guilty and sentenced to prison.",
    "answers": [
        "I agree with the attorney comments posted before mine. Yes, the bond is Dischargeable as to the Bankruptcy (BK) Debtor, but that does not invalidate the lien, nor with her BK excuse the obligation of the co-debtor. Many/Most BK Attorneys offer a no obligation consultation; I recommend your mom contact an experienced attorney in her area to discuss her facts, options, and goals.",
        "It is somewhat worse than that. The bail bond lien on her home is still there. She will have to pay it or the bail bonds will be able to foreclose on her home. They can go after the other \"friend.\" if they also have income or a lien on their home. The bail bond cannot act to collect the debt, but they can foreclose on the Deed of Trust and take her home.",
        "A cosigner and the security interest in the collateral (the home) is unaffected by your mother's bankruptcy. The bail bond would still have recourse against the house and/or the other co-signer."

        "File a police report immediately. Send a copy of the police report and a cover letter to the store and to corporate headquarters, with a copy of your receipt. Tell them what happened. Demand that the account be closed and that they immediately stop any credit reporting. Contact one of the credit reporting agencies and ask them to put a fraud alert on your credit report. Review your credit reports to determine if your information has been used to open any other accounts. And, you may also want to consult with an attorney which litigates consumer cases under the Fair Credit Reporting Act.",
        "The Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) provides victims of identity theft with certain rights.\n\nIf you request a fraud alert on your credit report, the credit reporting agencies are required to send you notice that you may request a free copy of your credit report. You only need to request a fraud alert with one of the credit reporting agencies Equifax, Experian or Trans Union because the credit reporting agency that received your fraud alert request must then forward your fraud alert request to the other two credit bureaus. If you decide not to request a fraud alert you are entitled to one free credit report per year from each of the three credit reporting agencies Equifax, Experian and Trans Union. You can request online at annualcreditreport.com or by calling 877-322-8228.\n\nThe most important requirement under the FCRA that the credit bureaus must comply with is the requirement to block the false item of information within four business days after receiving your dispute containing: identification of the fraudulent information (the Verizon account), a copy of an identity theft report (in your case the police report), your statement that the Verizon account is the result of identity theft, and proof of identity (such as a copy of your drivers license). You should also send in any other supporting documentation showing the account is a result of identity theft. You should send the dispute in writing by certified mail, and keep copies of all documents for yourself.\n\nYou should get the results of your dispute within 30 days. If the Verizon account is still reporting on any of your credit reports you may have claims under the FCRA.\n\nYou should also monitor what Verizon does with the account to make sure they do not try and sell it to a debt collector. If it is sold to a debt collector and the collection account is reported on your credit report then you will need to dispute the collection account.",
        "It is illegal to use someone else's personal identifying information to obtain good and services without the other person's consent. You may have been the victim of identity theft. You should not owe anything on this account. Unfortunately, when identity theft occurs the victims run the risk of having their credit damaged and collections departments pursuing them for illegitimate debts. You should consult with a lawyer knowledgeable in identity theft to make sure you are not harmed any further.",
        "File a police report and fill out an FTC Identity Theft Affidavit. Send the letter to the address listed on the letter you received from Verizon about the new account."

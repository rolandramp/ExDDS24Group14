        "You've received responses from attorneys experience in criminal law. On the civil law side of things, there is a three-year statute of limitations for fraud Code of Civil Procedure section 338, subdivision (d). However, it does not begin to run until the discovery, by the aggrieved party, of the facts constituting the fraud or mistake. It is was a straight up collections matter, there is 2-year statute for verbal contracts and a 4-year statute for written contracts that starts from the date of the breach.\n\nWhat you are describing, however, sounds more like a scam or illegal collection tactics to pressure you into paying this alleged debt. You might not even owe the money and I often get phone calls from scared debtors that have been falsely told that they could be arrested for not paying their debts.\n\nIf you need a bankruptcy attorney, I am in San Diego and offer free consultations.",
        "Need more information about the case, but potentially two separate issues here...one criminal and the other civil. One the criminal side, the DA usually has 3 years from the date the theft was discovered to file criminal charges. You should consider consulting with a local attorney. Most of them will offer a free case review. Good luck.",
        "You're talking about a couple of different concepts here.\n\nGrand larceny is a criminal offense. The statute of limitations in California is generally three years (with some exceptions that don't apply here). If the District Attorney didn't file criminal charges within three years of the discovery of the theft, you should be out of the woods.\n\nI will let my civil colleagues comment on the civil aspects."

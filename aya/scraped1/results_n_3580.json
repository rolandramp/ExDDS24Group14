        "Mr. Broiles has provided the correct answer. You may continue to make regular monthly payments on the note. The due-on-sale clause is not applicable because of the federal statute he cited. You’re good to go, so long as you make regular payments on the account.\n\nIt is also safe to advise the servicer of your mother’s death. Assuming this is a purchase money note, it is also safe to become personally obligated on the note if required by the lender, as no deficiency judgment can be obtained in CA. Good luck.",
        "You have received two very different answers. There are legal answers and practical answers. The legal answer is that if there is a due on sale clause in the contract, you would be a third party \"buying\" the property and the mortgage company can deem that a trigger of the due on sale clause. Practically speaking, they usually don't as long as the mortgage, taxes and insurance continue to be paid. If you can however, it would be best for you to refinance the mortgage, get it in your name, possibly pay off other debts and creditor's of your mother's estate so you don't have to worry about losing the home.",
        "Federal law (the Garn-St. Germain Act) says that the lender cannot demand the entire balance from you, or force you to refinance.\n\nYour attorney should be able to help you identify other areas of concern.",
        "The mortgage company has a right to demand payment if the new owner might not be able to pay the mortgage. You will need to work out with the mortgage company their acceptance of you as the new party who will be responsible for the property. Also, are the taxes paid on the property? Is the mortgage current or is it behind in payments. Also, if there are other creditors, then the court could demand that the property be sold to pay all creditors. Please seek legal assistance."

    "title": "Is it legal for Creditor to continue to communicate with Debtor after discharge received in CH7 BK?",
    "question": "CH7-BK Discharged Feb 2019. 2-vehicles listed: 1-Reaffirmation signed. 2nd-Will keep vehicle and continue to pay. *No Reaffirmation. I continued payments. Dec.2020:Informed Creditor due to COVID19 and no income, no payment will be made. Creditor replied asking for proof of positive test results and paystub showing $0.00. I am not sure if this violates HIPPA or if at all legal?? Received emails/texts requesting payment, with final message indicating cannot hold account any longer, payment required. Repo? Advised to pick up car. Repo Agency picked-up. Received \"Notice to Dispose of Vehicle\" along with $$ amount to reinstate.",

        "If you reaffirmed on one vehicle, meaning you timely signed the reaffirmation agreement and the creditor also signed it and it was filed with the bankruptcy court on or before the deadline for filing a reaffirmation agreement, then you do owe on that vehicle and it would not violate the discharge injunction to communicate with you about that debt. As to the vehicle you did not reaffirm but paid on for a time, It would be very hard to get a court to enter any sanction against the creditor based on the facts you recited. By paying for a while on a debt that was discharged with the apparent consent of the creditor (apparent because creditor did not repo the car immediately when you did not enter into a valid reaffirmation agreement as to that auto) you and the creditor created a tacit agreement that they would allow you to continue to possess their collateral as long as you kept paying for it. When you stopped, it (in my view) was not unreasonable for them to contact you to explore some other arrangements or to see where the car was located or if you still wanted it. I do not think most courts would see that you had been damaged by that conduct.",
        "My colleagues have given you accurate advice. You do not owe the creditor anything.",
        "The vehicle you did NOT reaffirm is discharged. You will not owe a dime. Do not pay. Ignore any notices as state law requires them to send you auction notices etc. I would not spend a cent on attorney fees for them answering myself. Use your money for a new vehicle or something else. But I will let an attorney in those other laws answer on it. On reaffirmed vehicle just keep paying or sell for fmv if creditor agrees to that amount and pay on deficiency if that is ever desired.\n\nYou may have a claim but one must ask how much money do I throw at attorney to pursue. And what if the court awards you less in damages than you have in attorney fees. Things to think about. But thanks for asking here on AVVO too.",
        "If you were not represented by an attorney, the creditor might be allowed to communicate with you about the vehicle you did not reaffirm, just as it would communicate with an attorney that represented you. Your explanation of what happened isn't clear. Hope this perspective helps!",
        "Agree with Mr. Granvold. You need to be clear which vehicle was repossessed. What I think you are saying is that you stopped paying on the reaffirmed car and advised the car creditor that you could no longer afford to pay, and the creditor wanted proof. Again, more info is needed. Better yet, if you had an attorney, call him or her and explain the situation."

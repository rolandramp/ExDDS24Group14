        "Yes, you would need to file a declaration pursuant to CCP Section 685.050. Unfortunately, there is no form. It's just a declaration, regarding how you calculated the interest you are requesting, that you would put on legal pleading paper (e.g., caption at top, 28 lines, etc.). Hope this helps."

        "The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA) does not allow for punitive damages.\n\nBut your state law may have a provision that allows for punitive damages against debt collectors who violate the law.\n\nIn Alabama, where I practice, we have a number of state law torts that in the right circumstances allow for punitive damages. The most common tort in a debt collection context is \"Invasion of Privacy\" but depending on what you are dealing with there may be others.\n\nAs the others have suggested, get with a good consumer lawyer in California and find out your rights.\n\nBest of success to you....\n\nJohn Watts\nBirmingham, Alabama",
        "\"Punitive damages\" are not included in the FDCPA. You can recover \"actual damages\", which may include emotional distress and aggravation and annoyance. You can also recover between $100 and $1,000. per violation, under the FDCPA. In addition, you can recover an additional $100. to $1,000. under California's Rosenthal Act. More importantly, you can also recover attorney's fees. There was a case (\"Komarova\") that went to jury trial in San Francisco about 2 years ago in which the jury awarded $340,000. in compensatory damages, $240,000. in attorney's fees, court costs of about $20,000. and punitive damages of $75,000. This judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeal. You should have a consultation with an attorney with litigation experience in this area. The viability of a lawsuit against the collection agency will depend upon a number of factors not contained in your question.",

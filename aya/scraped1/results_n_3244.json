    "question": "I entered a \"no contest\" plea to a misdemeanor criminal offense in CA. I am in the process of completing my community service hours now and will be done in the next two weeks. I wish to hire an attorney and to file for Chapter 7 Bankruptcy. Does having a criminal misdemeanor disqualify you from filing Chapter 7? Or is this just considered a debt that is not dischargeable. This a Debt / Bankruptcy Chapter 7 question - (not seeing that option to check below). Thank You.",
    "answers": [
        "The answer to your question is contained in Section 109 of the bankruptcy code \"who can be a debtor.\" To the best of my knowldege having a criminal misdemeanor does not disqualify you from filing Chapter 7.",
        "If you have been convicted of a financial related crime, that may have an impact upon your bankruptcy case. Other than that your criminal record should not affect your Chapter 7 filing, but you need to make sure you qualify. Any court ordered repayments, fines, or restitution from the misdemeanor cannot be discharged in the bankruptcy. I recommend consulting with an experience bankruptcy attorney to help guide you through the proper steps to take and explain the process.

But the most important thing is to meet with an attorney as you asking this question means you have not. You care about 2 goals: keeping everything you have equity in and discharging all your debts. If you don't have any of the exceptions to discharge you will obtain that goal; most exceptions are set forth in 11 USC. 523 (Google it) like child support, some income taxes, traffic (in a ch 7) and criminal fines as I quoted you above , and presumption of student loans.

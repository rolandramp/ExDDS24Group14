    "title": "Will I be responsible for my husband's credit card debt?",
    "question": "This is a follow-up to an earlier question. My husband and I have been separated for about 15 years, we file separately (married, separated), etc. However, I do have a revocable trust, with my husband as co-trustee. My condo, fully paid for, is part of the trust. Will the condo be in jeopardy if any action is taken against him regarding his credit card debt?",
    "answers": [
        "I just add that I hope you are not on the written contracts on the credit cards as if incurred in CA which is a community property state, and you never terminated the contracts at separation, then the contact you are still under if that happened. I am not a divorce attorney but after separation you would not be liable if a new card was used. I advise sometimes clients to in fact send certified mail return receipt that they are NOT any longer responsible for the credit card and to keep that proof and if the credit card company does not close, then to use as a defense to such attempt to collect. Good luck. I hope you are all covered. This is just to add to the prior great answers.",
        "Generally, you are responsible for his credit card debt if you guarantied it or he was using your credit card account with your permission. Other, being married does not make you responsible for his debt",
        "As long as you are the trustor of the trust and the sole beneficiary of the trust while you are alive, you should be fine, But, I suggest that you have the trust reviewed by a lawyer who is experienced with both bankruptcy and trusts. Being a trustee of a trust does not give the trustee an ownership interest in the trust."

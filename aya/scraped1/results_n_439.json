    "title": "Do supplemental insurance payouts need to be included as income in bankruptcy?",
    "question": "My husband was injured at work and as a result has received supplemental insurance payouts (company similar to AFLAC), do these need to be reported as income on the bankruptcy petition?",
    "answers": [
        "I agree with my colleagues that supplemental insurance benefits from a private carrier similar to AFLAC need to be disclosed as income on Schedule I, as well as in the means test (Form 122A).\n\nBut if your husband's injury results in a permanent disability that entitles him to permanent Social Security Disability Income (SSDI), while the benefit payments would need to be disclosed on Schedule I as income, they would be excluded from consideration on Form 122A for means testing purposes.\n\nSo, if including of the temporary insurance benefits is preventing you and your husband from passing the means test, and a long term disability is likely to remain that would qualify him for SSDI, then delaying the bankruptcy filing (if possible) may mean the difference between failing the means test (and 5 years of making Chapter 13 payments) and qualifying for Chapter 7.",

        "It is income. I agree with Attorney Rode.",
        "Yes, this should be included in your bankruptcy paperwork. Any monthly payouts should be included in Schedule I as income and any lump sum monetary payouts should be included on Schedule B as an asset that you will need to protect (in order to keep) with the proper exemption on Schedule C. I would recommend speaking with some bankruptcy attorneys and hopefully retaining one for your case, it is well worth it for your case to be done correctly the first time around."

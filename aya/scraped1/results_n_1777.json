        "When you state that your 2nd TD was stripped, you understand that it is not automatic, right? You need a court order from the BK judge stating the lien is stripped. All lien strip 13's must complete the Plan as a condition to getting a lien strip order. Talk with your BK lawyer to make sure you obtained such an order. As to your credit report, that is merely a history of your payments, etc. If there are errors in your report, then do as my colleagues suggest: dispute them.",
        "If you're saying that they are still reporting a balance, you should do as my two colleagues have mentioned and dispute the information through the credit bureaus. If, however, you're saying that you can see the history of your mortgage payments, or lack thereof, on the report, the bankruptcy does not remove those records. Some people believe (not saying this is you) that a bankruptcy wipes the credit report completely clean. It certainly does not. It eliminates debt, but it does not erase history.",
        "You are entitled to a clean credit report. You may dispute the contents by following procedures printed on back of credit report and on website..",
        "How about following the procedures on the back of credit reports to dispute the entries? Have you done that?"

        "Yes, I also agree with the other attorneys that you should consult with a bankruptcy attorney. More than that, you should HIRE a quality bankruptcy attorney.\n\nA \"free consultation\" will only get you so much information. Attorneys are not there to spend money for their offices and employees only to give you their services for free. Therefore, they are NOT going to tell you everything to be your own attorney. An attorney may tell you about the top of the iceberg. However, it is what was below the waterline that sank the Titanic.\n\nI have seen absolute disasters from people who thought that they get everything for free from those attorneys and then filed their own bankruptcy cases. Here is a situation that could have cost you the loss of a $20,000 vehicle to save some attorney’s fees. And that is just one thing. Lord knows what others are out there that you would never have a clue about.\n\nI just had a case where people had a \"free consultation\" with me. It was a complicated case as to planning to deal with things that they had that were not \"exempt\" meaning it was something a trustee could take away. I had solutions. However, they had some cheap \"legal insurance\" through their employer or their union. No experienced attorney is going to do bankruptcy based on what these insurance policies will pay.\n\nThey ended up using it and saved about $1,500 in out of pocket fees. The attorney failed to understand things that an attorney with several decades experience would have known. As a result, they found themselves losing over $20,000.\n\nThey came back to me. I could not help myself and pointed out that they saved $1,500 off my fees. They wanted me to substitute into their case in place of the attorney that was such a deal. I told them they would have to pay me the whole fee I had quoted PLUS $500 more because I was now having to clean up the mess their case now was. In addition, I told them that I could only fix about $12,000 of the problems. They were still going to lose about $8,000 to the Bankruptcy Trustee. No one was happy... except the bankruptcy trustee and the creditors.\n\nI recommend that you check and see if you can find an attorney that is a California State Bar Certified Bankruptcy Law Specialist.

You can find out who is by going to the California State Bar website.\n\nYou can cross over to see what they have as an Avvo.com 10.0 Rating.

But the most important thing is to meet with an attorney as you asking this question means you have not. You care about 2 goals: keeping everything you have equity in and discharging all your debts. If you don't have any of the exceptions to discharge you will obtain that goal; most exceptions are set forth in 11 USC. 523 (Google it) like child support, some income taxes, traffic (in a ch 7) and criminal fines , and presumption of student loans.

        "Unfortunately, what would you damages be? You're on the account a joint obligor. You are equally responsible for the payments and have a responsibility to make sure payment is being made, either by you or by her. You \"should\" have known when payment was first late, because you're an account holder. And if late, you would have to have made a payment, because you're an account holder as well. Even if she purposely is trying to ruin your credit, you're obligated to make payment on the account and can control that yourself as well.",
        "Agreeing with Mr. Steingraber above, I would add that learning about a separated spouse filing a bankruptcy petition is a good time to seriously consider filing one yourself.",

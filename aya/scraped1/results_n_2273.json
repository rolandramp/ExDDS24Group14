        "Yes the real property taxes are owed. If the estate has money then by all means pay the property taxes to avoid the 10% penalty. If the property is going to be sold in the probate then they will be paid by escrow from the proceeds of sale. Simply, if there is money pay it and if not do not kill yourself over a 10% penalty. Most times if you loan the money for property taxes, insurance and/or mortgage payments, they can be directly reimbursed from escrow from the proceeds of the sale rather than waiting until the end of the case. I hope this helps.\nwww.TheProbateGuy.com",

        "Mr. Benton has given you the information you need to consider and explained generally how to proceed. As he states however, that is general - there are a lot of factors that go into each individual case including how the assets are going to be distributed and how the debts are going to be paid. If you have worked all of that out, when the 4 month creditor's claim period expires, you can Petition for Final Distribution. In the meantime you might want to start researching what is required with that as there are no forms to help you. Good luck.",
        "You won't hear from the judge. Getting this done is your responsibility not the judge's and not the court's. The next steps depend a lot on the case facts. Have any creditors filed claims? Have you had estate taxes figured out? Have you notified the DHS about the decedent? Do you need to notify the state Victims Compensation Board? Have all the estate debts been paid? If all of these have been accomplished, then 4 months after Letters have been issued, you can then file a petition for distribution and file an accounting and ask the court for orders to distribute the estate. But there are variable here also. I strongly suggest you seek legal help.",
        "I agree with the other attorneys and you were probably provided with papers which would detail the steps."

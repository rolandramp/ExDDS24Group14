    "title": "How can I file Chapter 13 when I have filed Chapter 7 3years and 9 months ago?",
    "question": "I recently fell so behind on my bills and I have just received a garnishment letter in the mail to garnish my pay as well as a lien mailed to me from the same creditor. I know they say I can't file Chapter 13 for a discharge before the four year mark, but I there anything I can do now? I file chapter 7 05/2015 and received discharge.",
    "answers": [
        "My colleague Mr. Firth nailed it on the head.\n\nUntil four years have lapsed since the date of filing of your prior Chapter 7 case, any Chapter 13 case you file would not result in a discharge, although it would trigger the automatic stay and allow you to file a plan of 36 to 60 months duration, depending on whether your household income is above or below the statewide median income for California.\n\nBut I disagree that it would have to be a 100% plan. If it was a lesser percentage, then you simply would not pay the full amount of the claims and when the plan was completed, you would not receive a discharge of the unpaid balance. But if you can hang in there until July 6, 2019, the Chapter 13 case would result in the discharge of the unpaid portion of the claims, without forcing you to propose a 100% plan.\n\nTo stall the garnishment, you may wish to file a claim of exemption in the state court. All the forms you need can be downloaded from the court's website or at https://www.courts.ca.gov/formsrules.htm.\n\nYour wages can be garnished no more than 25% under federal protections, and the state court can reduce that to less than 25% if you claim an exemption and show that your needs are such that a lesser percentage would be needed to allow you to support yourself and any dependents.\n\nUntil the court holds the hearing on your claim of exemption, the garnishment will be delayed. If the judgment against you is being enforced in the Los Angeles County Superior Court (where you listed your location), the delays in getting a hearing are notorious. By the time the matter is heard, win or lose, you may have reached or be very close to July 6, 2019. Every day you hold off the garnishment and get closer to being able to file a \"discharging\" Chapter 13 will be worth it in savings down the road over 3 to 5 years of a Chapter 13 plan.",
        "If at all possible, wait out the 4 years. During the interim, file a Claim of Exemption.",
        "Speak to some experienced bankruptcy attorneys as soon as possible. You can file chapter 13 to stop the garnishment. If you are filing chapter 13 within 4 years of filing chapter 7 then you will not receive a discharge of the debt you do not pay back during the chapter 13. If you file chapter 13 after 4 years of filing chapter 7 then you will receive a discharge of any debt you do not pay back during your chapter 13 plan.",
        "Yes, you can file Chapter 13 now, stop the garnishment. You will have to propose a plan and it could be less than 100%. If the trustee objects to the confirmation of your plan, you can always negotiate it.\n\nSee the advice of a competent Chapter 13 Attorney asap.",
        "If you file a chapter 13 with a plan paying 100% to your unsecured creditors, you can file now. If you are filing a plan that provides less than 100% to your unsecured creditors (and you probably are), you will have to wait four years and a day from the date you filed your chapter 7. See your bankruptcy attorney for details."

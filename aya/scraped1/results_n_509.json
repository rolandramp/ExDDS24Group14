    "question": "My only asset in California is a duplex that I got in my divorce.",
    "answers": [
        "If they are unable to personally serve you, they can easily serve you by publication, which is what happens in probably 50% of cases regardless of where you live. Most of my clients that have judgments against them never knew there was a lawsuit filed.\n\nBankruptcy is probably the best way to eliminate these debts.",
        "I agree with the answers of my colleagues.",
        "Please consider all the (good) answers above. I'll add that (1) you can file bankruptcy here, while living elsewhere, based on the presence of your assets here and (2) whether bankruptcy is a good idea or not for you would be determined by you getting a consultation with an experienced bankruptcy attorney in your area.",
        "Consider this. Lets assume that the credit card companies obtain a judgment against you and slap a lien on your duplex, then intercept your rents.\n\nYou would then have to hire an attorney to set aside the default.\n\nFar better to seek the assistance of an attorney and formulate an asset protection plan.",
        "I differ in opinion regarding the other attorneys because in order to serve you by publication they still have to have a good address on you to serve you with notice of the written publication due to one important factor: you at one time resided in CA and have moved away.\n\n1. Start with Statute of Limitations. If you have intentionally absented yourself from the state, the SOL is tolled. You still own property there, have contacts there, and obviously your tenant is paying rent to someone, who would possibly be an agent for service of process. As a landlord, that might be considered a business; and if you're required to obtain a business license of some kind or landlord license that might be another issue. Assuming the SOL is not an issue in the case, and you are now a permanent resident of another country, then you have other issues.\n\n2. Several statutes apply: CCP's 413.10, 415.50 and 416.90. The one you should be concerned about is 415.50(a)(2). \"(2) The party to be served has or claims an interest in real or personal property in this state that is subject to the jurisdiction of the court or the relief demanded in the action consists wholly or in part in excluding the party from any interest in the property.\"\n\nIf I were to go about collecting on a credit card debt, I would sue, demand relief in quasi-in-rem and seek an ex parte writ of attachment. Credit card debt is subject to easily being calculated and is a cause of action in CA and the duplex is subject to attachment/levy in California. This is called \"Quasi-in-rem\" jurisdiction. The trial court is limited to only the property you own, and no personal judgment can result. Now its a race between all your credit card companies to see who will first attach the property and sell it at a sheriff's sale.\n\n3. Under Constitutional principles, all I need to do is find you and serve you with the papers. I could, theoretically serve your tenants as well. Once they're served I would depose them to find out where you live or where the money gets sent. After that its only a matter of time. For instance if you get SS benefits, I may not be able to subpoena the IRS or SSA to get that information, but your bank may be subpoenaed to find out where your statements are sent.\n\n4. If you were once a resident of CA at the time the debt accrued, then you could be served and a personal judgment taken against you, and the pleadings amended anyway.\n\nOthers have suggested filing for bankruptcy but you would have to be a resident of the district where the bankruptcy is filed for at least 180 days and available to appear. Not sure your duplex would not be sold by the court anyway. If you filed a Ch. 13 or 11 it might happen, but again its iffy. Not enough facts.\n\nOtherwise, you seem to be concerned about tax consequences. Perhaps your better bet is to pay off the smaller debts first and then try and settle the larger ones later. This question has many moving parts, all of which are dependent on how badly your creditors want to hunt you down. If the duplex is in your name, its only a matter of time before they sue you.",
        "Unless you are a legal resident of CA for bankruptcy purposes, you cannot file for Bankruptcy. Eventually, you will not have any income to live off of, since the duplex will be taken by your creditors. Taking legal advice from \"Friends\" is crazy, unless they are licensed attorneys and practice in the area of law that you have a legal problem in. My learned colleagues are correct that you can be served by publication. The only thing that is exempt from your creditors is your Federal pension. Use AVVO's Find a Lawyer tool to select a qualified attorney. Good luck. THIS IS NOT LEGAL ADVICE! YOU NEED TO SPEAK TO AN ATTORNEY WHO IS LICENSED IN YOUR STATE FOR LEGAL ADVICE. This is merely suggestions for you to think about in discussing your situation with the local attorney.",
        "Atty Straus is correct. If the creditor gets a default judgment against you, it can be recorded as a lien against any RE in your name in the CA county. If you don't have any equity now, you may have some as the property appreciates. Eventually, you may have to face this debt later on. BK is a better option assuming you can exempt any equity you have in the property using the so-called \"wild card\" exemption. Property not occupied by you when you file, cannot be exempted using the traditional Real Estate exemption.\n\nRemember, BK is more than checking boxes on forms you find online. Find/consult/hire a lawyer using the Avvo feature \"Find a Lawyer\". Make a list of 4-5 having many 5 star reviews from satisfied clients. If you don't get a prompt call back from one, go on to the next on your list. Some offer a free consultation by phone or in person.",

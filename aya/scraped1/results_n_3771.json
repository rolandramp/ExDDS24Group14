    "title": "Do credit cards with zero balance \"survive\" bankruptcy chapter 7",
    "question": "I will be filing chapter 7 in the next month. I have many store, master card and visa cards that have zero balance. Will these cards still be active and able to use after chapter 7 bankruptcy?",
    "answers": [
        "Possibly. The bank has all the leverage and may exercise its discretion to allow continued credit privileges or, alternatively, to terminate use of the card. There is a procedure in bankruptcy called \"reaffirmation\" and, if you and the bank BOTH agree to reaffirmation, you can keep the card. Essentially, reaffirmation is your concession that, although you have filed bankruptcy, you agree that the particular debt of the bank will not be affected by the bankruptcy discharge - in other words, you will still owe the debt. In exchange, the bank agrees to allow you to keep and use the credit card. There could be some limitations and conditions placed on your continued use. Of course, the question is begged, can you reaffirm a card that has no balance ? I suggest you contact the bank, ask them that question and be sure to mention the term \"reaffirmation.\" Many credit card companies have specific procedures, and even departments, for reaffirmations.",
        "Since you do not owe them any money, they are not creditors. Therefore, you do not notify them of your bankruptcy filing. However, if they learn of your filing (through a public records search or a routine credit check/report), they will likely close the account because you are deemed a high risk borrower. But it is interesting because if you successfully get a discharge, you are not eligible for another 8 years to get a discharge so the credit companies shouldn't fear you running out on them :) Best of luck!!!",
        "It depends. Credit cards with no balances do not get listed in your Chapter 7, so there may be a possibility that you'll get to keep them open. However, the bank issuing that particular credit card may have a policy to cancel your credit card if you file for Bankruptcy.\n\nYou should contact your credit card company and ask what their policy is regarding this issue.\n\nBest of luck,\n\nGerardo",
        "This is up to the credit card company. However, as a general rule they all cancel the cards when you file, regardless of the balance. Sears is the only card company with a history of letting you keep the card with lower limits and other conditions.",
        "If a charge card actually has a zero balance it won't be listed in a Chapter 7 filing as a current debt. However, most card issuers check your credit report on a regular basis (many as often as monthly). When they see a bankruptcy filing they almost always will close your account. If you read your credit card agreements, they will also label a bankruptcy filing as a default. There is no law requiring a company to close the credit card accounts, but odds are high that they will.\n\nNow, a warning. I've filed bankruptcies for over 33 years. The saddest thing I get to do is a repeat Chapter 7. I have had some clients do two or even three. Credit cards can get you in the same mess you are in now, and for 8 years you will be ineligible for a new Chapter 7. If an account is kept open, be very cautious in using it.",
        "First, as all the other answers indicate in reality probably 100% of your cards will be cancelled. Secondly, you can obtain new ones or a secured visa card to build your credit later. Thirdly, a zero balance on credit reports on many cards hurts your score (they think you can obtain cash advances on all and go live somewhere on all those monies, etc.). So my advice is to close cards not really used now anyway. Finally, many of your zero balance cards may in fact have a yearly fee and thus the contract is wiped off by the bankruptcy no matter what and why you could list them IF not closed ahead of time. I would call and close the ones with zero balance and they will be discharged if any monies owed anyway and card usage stopped when the creditor receives notice that you filed! I have had clients use those cards post bankruptcy and then suddenly it is cancelled when they went to pay car repairs..so get a new card post petition that you can rely on. If needed, obtain a secured visa and use your own money too. Good luck.",
        "The bad news is most credit card companies are tightly linked in to the bankruptcy court filing system and will receive notice of your bankruptcy immediately, even if you have a $0 balance on the card & were not required to & did not list this account. Many will cancel you out right away, a few will continue to welcome you as a customer. Hope this perspective helps!",
        "Almost all credit card companies receive notices of BK filings. Many will cancel the card. But maybe one or two will let you retain a credit line. Some may retain a credit line but at a lower limit. Good luck.",
        "No. In the fine print of your card member agreement is a clause that says filing for bankruptcy is an of default and the card will be revoked even if you were current with that card. On the bright side after you file your mailbox will full of new albeit lower balance credit card offers. Your attorney will explain all of this when you file.",
        "It's possible to still keep the zero balance accounts active, but not a guaranty. You do not have to list the zero balance accounts in the bankruptcy, because they are not debts. However, if you list other debts with the same company or the company does a periodic credit check on you and discovers the bankruptcy, they may close down your credit account, even if nothing is owed and it is in good standing. If you are lucky, you can keep using your zero balance credit accounts after bankruptcy, and it is a great way to improve your credit score and pursue your financial fresh start. Good luck."

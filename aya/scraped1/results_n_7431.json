        "As a franchise attorney, I agree with the other attorney answers. The $800 minimum tax is exactly that - a minimum of $800 is due every year, whether the business has a loss or no income at all. It's basically for the privilege of operating a business entity in California. You may want to consider operating your company as s sole proprietorship. In that event, there is no $800 minimum tax payment.\n\nKevin B. Murphy, B.S., M.B.A., J.D.\nAttorney at Law\nDirector of Operations - Mr. Franchise\nFRANCHISE FOUNDATIONS APC",
        "A limited liability company in California is subject to the $800 Minimum Tax each year and must file a tax return and pay this tax until it is dissolved.

        "Without insurance, your LLC will “protect” you from personal liability, even though you lose all the assets held by the LLC. Insurance can prevent virtually all loss to your net worth. Consult a business lawyer about this.\nYour threshold question should be whether to form an entity (an LLC or an S Corp). It is a tradeoff between (1) unlimited personal liability and (2) paying to form the LLC and the taxes and fees payable by the LLC. (Consult a local lawyer as to his fees, state filing fees and taxes.) If risk is your main concern, the LLC is more advantageous; if costs, then a sole proprietorship.\nWhether to incorporate is a question only you can answer. How risky do you think this business is? Incorporation protects your personal assets from creditors of the entity (i.e., the LLC or the corporation) but the entity remains liable for debts. The first thing to do is to get good liability insurance coverage–talk to a knowledgeable insurance agent. Also get professional responsibility (malpractice) insurance, as the LLC will not protect you there. Ordinarily the entity will not protect you from bank loans because the bank will require you to guarantee the loan personally. An LLC or an S corp will protect you from some of the liability while letting you deduct the business expenses on your personal tax return. An S corp has tricky rules for eligibility; if you lose the S corp treatment, the corp will become a C corp, liable for taxes on its income. This means double taxation. An LLC works just as well without the tax risk. If you transfer a building to a corp, you will regret it when it’s time to sell the building. You will be better off to buy liability insurance on the building and lease it to the LLC if you opt for an LLC.\n\nAs to your Q: If you decide you need protection, you should not wait till you have income.

        "As stated by my colleagues, until we know whether the debtor files Chapter 7, or 13, it is not possible to offer you any useful advice. The BK threat may be a bluff. Your lawyer can check PACER for any previous BK filings. A debtor can file a Chapter 7 only every 8 years. A Chapter 13 case can be filed after a 7 right away, but a 13 must provide for payment to creditors, based on the debtor's budget. A knowledge of the extent of the debtor's assets is essential in evaluating any settlement offer. If the debtor was driving while impaired and caused the accident, the debtor cannot get that debt discharged.",
        "As a practical matter, a critical issue for me is whether the driver who hit you had car insurance. That's probably the only asset available to pay your claim if the other driver files for bankruptcy. The insurance carrier cannot hide behind the other driver's bankruptcy to avoid paying the claim. The insurance carrier must still cover the loss under Insurance Code sec. 11580(b). If you have not already done so, you and your attorney may wish to think about asking the other driver for a \"no assets\" declaration to prove he qualifies for bankruptcy protection.",
        "As stated by Ms. Rode, it depends upon his assets and other liabilities. Also what kind of car accident it was. Have your attorney look at his financials with you to determine what your likelihood of collecting in a bankruptcy would be. Yes, simple automobile accident claims can be discharged in bankruptcy. The issues are: what can he file, and what can he exempt. Look at those financials and you'll have a better idea.",
        "A lot depends on what type of bankruptcy he files. He will need to list your claim as a debt and you as a creditor. You would want to review his bankruptcy paperwork and attend his 341(a) meeting with the Trustee. You will want to make sure all of his assets and employment are listed. In California you can protect some equity in a home and car and still file for bankruptcy. If your income is under a certain limit then you could qualify to have all of your debt discharged without making payments on it, it is commonly called \"passing the mean's test.\" Review his settlement offer with your lawyer. It might be wise to take what his is offering if it is a legitimate offer otherwise it is true you may wind up with nothing. Another thought, if there is anything unusual about the accident like he also got a DUI, it may not be dischargeable in bankruptcy, but your lawyer probably would have told you that already. Hope this helps."

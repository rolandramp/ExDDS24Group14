        "Generally creditors would need a court judgment first to impose wage garnishment. If you were never served, you likely have grounds to vacate the judgment, but you must act quickly as there are limited time frames to do so. You should speak to an attorney right away to help you obtain a copy of the court file on your case and then look into whether service was valid, and file a motion to vacate the judgment if appropriate.",

        "One thing you can do during the interim, is to file a \"Claim of Exemption\" and \"Financial Statement\" with the levying officer. These forms should have accompanied the Earnings Withholding Order (Wage Garnishment) that your employer received. You must qualify to obtain the exemption. The levying officer will let the creditor know that you have filed the forms. If the creditor does not respond within a certain time period, you will receive the exemption and your wages will not be garnished. If the creditor opposes the exemption, they must file an opposition and request for hearing. When you file the Claim of Exemption, you are essentially asking the court to hold you exempt from the garnishment. You will have to demonstrate, via the Financial Statement, that an undue hardship will be caused by the creditor taking money from your paycheck, and as such, you should be exempt. At the same time, consider filing a Motion to Vacate the Judgment if you were not properly served. If the judgment was obtained more than 10 years ago, check to see if it was renewed prior to the expiration of 10 years. Judgments must be renewed every 10 years. Consider the possibility of filing bankruptcy and eliminating the debt. Consult with an experienced attorney.",

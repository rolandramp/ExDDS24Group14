    "title": "Chase modified my first mortgage and forgave my 2nd line of credit in 2013. Will I have to pay taxes on the forgiven 150k 2nd?",
    "question": "My first and 2nd were both with Chase. The 2nd was a line of credit I had taken for some home improvements, but also paid credit cards, etc. with it. I was given a 1099 at the time of forgiveness, and my accountant is telling me that I will owe approximately $40k in taxes! Since this was a settlement due to loan modification with Chase, am is this considered income? Thanks.",

        "Ask your accountant why Form 982 does not apply in your situation, which is the form you file to EXCLUDE personal residence debt cancellation income from being taxable, assuming it is your personal residence. It may have something to do with the date you got the HELOC, or the total loan amount(s). If you are so inclined you can look up and read the instructions on the irs website for Form 982. Your account should know what form 982 is. (Disclaimer-I am not a CPA or tax attorney), but have researched this issue in depth for my real estate practice, and incidentally I had a similar situation as you on my own personal residence, although both my loans were taken out as part of the purchase so that is clearly not your situation so that probably is the reason 982 would not save you. I would get additional opinions from other CPAs as to how to work this out. If all is hopeless, you should be able to do an offer in compromise with the IRS, but you need an experienced tax attorney to help you get the best result. I do have a personal referral if it comes to that. Good Luck",
        "Debt forgiveness is generally considered income. But there are several exceptions to this rule in the Internal Revenue Code. Your accountant should carefully review the 2007 Mortgage Forgiveness Debt Relief Act. Depending on the nature of your home improvements, you may be able to argue that the second mortgage was used for the “substantial improvement” of your real property. I will tell you that the amount of the second mortgage loan proceeds used to pay credit cards would not be the type of mortgage debt covered by the Mortgage Forgiveness Debt Relief Act, however."

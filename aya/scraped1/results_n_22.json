        "A confirmed plan in a chapter 11 which designates how creditors are to be paid, is a contract with those creditors. Was the chapter 11 filed by the business? The creditor had an opportunity to object to the proposed plan in terms of the payments and is bound by the plan. However, the business chapter 11 did not eliminate your personal guarantee. If the chapter 11 was filed by you personally, then it dealt with your personal liability and the creditor cannot pursue you otherwise. I recommend you talk with your bankruptcy attorney to get these issues clarified so you can determine how to proceed.",

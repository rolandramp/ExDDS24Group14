    "title": "Terminate parental rights to get out of long term custody battle with a narcissist?",
    "question": "Mother was granted move away 8 years ago and Father asked for a second custody evaluation which determined that child should remain with Mother primarily. Father is now intending to go to trial to right the most recent custody evaluation and ask the judge to reverse the custody evaluators decision. The child's therapist and teachers all believe that it is in the child's best interest to remain with Mother. In the meantime, this 8 year battle has cost me close to 100,000 in legal fees. 100% of the child support has gone toward legal fees. The stress is overwhelming. The custody evaluator (20K) has decided that he would conduct another evaluation in a year. What is the best method in permanently stopping these legal processes? Is the only option to terminate my parental rights?",
    "answers": [
        "You should really consult with an attorney regarding your legal options. Terminating your parental rights is very serious and should not be taken lightly.",
        "The only ability you have to terminate parental rights would be if, in fact, there is another individual who will stand in your place and adopt the child. Otherwise, no dice.\n\nJohn N. Kitta\nFremont",
        "Assuming, from your final question, that you are the father, one viable option would be to stop fighting over custody. Two evaluations have come to the same conclusion, the therapist apparently agrees, and apparently so does the court. These are not good odds, and - as you say - 100% of the child support has gone to legal fees. Wouldn't that money be better spent on providing for the child's needs?\n\nIf you are the mother and are asking about whether you should let the child go to the father, that is entirely up to you, but this is not the same as terminating parental rights.\n\nJust to be clear, regardless of who you are, \"terminating parental rights\" will ONLY happen if there has been no significant contact between a parent and child for some time (i.e. \"abandonment,\" and fighting for custody is the *opposite* of abandonment). Also, the court will not terminate a parent's rights just upon request of the parent whose rights are supposedly to be terminated. That would be like washing one's hands of a legal obligation because it's too burdensome. One cannot discharge one's parental relationship and obligation the way one can discharge debts in Bankruptcy Court. (In fact, child support cannot be discharged in Bankruptcy.)"

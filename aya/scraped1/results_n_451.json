        "In a \"no asset\" chapter 7 case, creditors rarely file a proof of claim. In an Asset Case and in Chapter 13 cases, sometimes the small creditors don't bother to file and sometimes they do. Same with personal loans.",
        "No, they do not all file proof of claims. In a chapter 7, no asset case (no assets for the trustee to sell), very rarely does a creditor file a proof of claim. Proof of claims are more common in chapter 13 cases because sometime even unsecured creditors (credit cards, loans, etc) receive a percentage of the payment plan funds. The only way an unsecured creditor receives funds in a chapter 13 case is if they file proof of claim with the Court. Hope this helps."

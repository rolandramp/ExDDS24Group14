    "title": "Paying off Debts in a Divorce",
    "question": "Before my marriage I had a 750 credit score. Now I'm getting a divorce and my score is around 500 due to foreclosure and a pile of charge offs in my name because she had bad credit when we got married and and everything was put in my name. We have assets to sell and pay off the debts but my wife says she doesn't want to pay them off. She says i should settle the debts with my creditors which will affect my credit for 7 years. The question is, do I have the right to want all the debts paid off so I can restore my credit rather than settling with creditors? What does the law say about this situation? How have the courts dealt with this kind of issue?",

        "You live in CA. You should check out the CA lawyer responses. Generally speaking debt acquired during the marriage is community debt. (Exceptions exist but based on your question it looks like all your debts are for goods and services and those are community debts). Let us assume you wish to divorce without a lawyer. You and your wife must serve each other with disclosures regarding your income and expenses, Form FL-150, and your assets and debts, Form FL-142. On FL-142 you must list the assets and debts of the community and indicate what assets, if any, are separate property or in which there is a separate property component. Similarly, you must list on the FL-142 what debts there are and what, if any, separate property debts or debts with a separate property component there are.\nCalifornia law is exceedingly fair and therefore it can get complicated. Dividing debt may result Epstein/Watts issues. Epstein credits In Re Marriage of Epstein (1979) 24 Cal 3d. 76, relate to rights of reimbursement which a party may be entitled as result of the payment of community obligations with separate funds. Watts credits, In Re Marriage of Watts (1985) 171 Cal App 3d 366 relate to reimbursement to which a party or the community may be entitled as a result of one parties’ use of community assets since the separation date. That stuff usually requires a lawyer.\n\nTAKE AWAY FROM THIS POST: Your wife doesn't dictate what the parties do with community debt. I infer you haven't yet filed for divorce. Once you do so, you should prepare the disclosures (I'm still assuming you're doing this by yourself) and have them served. If you can't agree on what to do with the debt you can have a trial in which the court will divide the debt.",
        "Having any marital debt remaining post judgment is perilous. Disgruntled former spouses rarely pay off debt that has your name attached to it. The best strategy is to pay off all such debt using marital assets as part of the judgment. Insist that all such debt be addressed.",
        "Despite all the facile answers from out of state lawyers, there is no simple answer. The court will use their handy dandy meat ax and divide debts and assets equally. You can pay it all off if you wish, but out of YOUR assets.",
        "Here's the problem - just because the divorce decree says that she is to accept \"X\" percentage of the debt doesn't mean she'll pay it, as you indicate. The issue is that, since your name is on the debt as well, if YOU don't pay it, they'll make it bad debt and come after you for payment anyway. You can certainly take her back to court on a contempt motion, but there is little a judge can do to MAKE her pay a debt. So, I'd advise sticking to your guns and demand that ALL marital debt be cleared with the sale of marital assets so that there is no outstanding debt. Period. If she doesn't like that, then you will have to litigate your divorce and get the court to order that course of action.",
        "The way to resolve this is to take the debt, along with sufficient assets to pay it off.",
        "Generally any debt acquired during the marriage is marital debt and subject to equitable division. If she takes half the debt and doesn’t pay, then you’re still on the hook with the creditor. If you want to avoid bankruptcy, you might have to work out some agreement with her where you take primary responsibility for the debt, but she gives you additional property to offset the debt. Additional property could be in the form of existing property on hand or a property settlement payment, where she is reimbursing you over a period of time. The trouble with that is sometimes collecting if she doesn’t or can’t pay down the road. You’ve got a complicated situation and should talk to an attorney who does both divorce and bankruptcy work in your area to discuss your options. Also advise you both talk to some type of consumer counseling / debt management agency to see if they can help."

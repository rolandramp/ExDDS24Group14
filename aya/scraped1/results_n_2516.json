    "title": "Expenses on community property after filing divorce",
    "question": "Husband filed divorce one year back and moved out of the community property - the house. Divorce still under process. Wife continued to live in the house and paid all home expenses from her Separate property - salary earned post divorce was filed. Husband now claims that he will not reimburse her for any expenses on house for last year because she was the one using the house and not him. Is this fair given that wife's money has been used to keep mortgage payments going? The house is a joint tenancy.",
    "answers": [
        "You need to know about Watts charges and Epstein credits. These are court cases that explain reimbursement rights related to use of the community home, by one person, post separation. Usually, fair market rental value is assessed each month until the house is sold or awarded to one party or the other. Of course, credit is given for payments made, post separation, as to community debts, such as a mortgage, 2nd TD, credit cards, medical bills, HOA fees and property taxes. When the full Ccounting is done, credits and charges, you will know who will pay, and how much. By the way, agreement to pay is not a problem, these issues will be determined by the judge at a trial if there is no agreement.",
        "There is something call Epstein/Watts credits and reimbursements but this usually ends up in what we normally call a \"wash\". You need to do the math on this and suggest you seek legal assistance on this.",
        "The expenses must be apportioned. The wife is entitled to a credit for half of the mortgage payments. The husband - who owns half of the house but has lived outside of it - is entitled to half of the fair rental value.",
        "Here is how I would analyze this type of situation:\n\na. The person who paid the mortgage would be entitled to an \"Epstein Credit\" for their payments on the mortgage following separation. Since this is a joint debt, this credit would be for half of the payments, only.\n\nb. The person who lived in the house would owe \"Watts Credits\" to the out-spouse. This is one half of the net fair rental value of the house. \"Net fair rental value\" means the going market rate to rent such a house, minus the mortgage payments, the property taxes, and the insurance.\n\nIn *most* cases, this turns out to be pretty close to a wash. Thus, it is not unusual for the in-spouse to just pay the mortgage for the privilege and benefit of living in the house, and the parties call it even. Of course, the values in question in your case may not be a wash, and this is a good question for a more analytical approach.",
        "This is a complex area of law and its important to recognize the differences between living expenses debt and community property debt. An \"ideal\" situation is where both parties move out of the house and rent it to a third party. Then each spouse receives one-half the rent and each would pay 1/2 the mortgage and expenses. Here, the wife decided to stay in the home. Thus, the community is still entitled to the value of the asset (the house rent) and the spouse (you) who is living in the home may need to reimburse the community for your use of the house - post-separation. This is called a \"Watts\" credit. But, the wife has been paying the mortgage on her own (presumably from separate property money). So, there's a possibility she could be entitled to a credit -- where the husband would owe you money...because the wife paid all the home expenses. These are called \"Epstein\" credits.\nThe bottom line is that this is a very complicated are of divorce law and the wife will need an experienced attorney to guide her. It can be confusing but she should seek out and interview several lawyers who can give her more specific advice and do the calculations."

        "As Mr. Firth notes, if there is no sense of urgency due to garnishment risk, I would wait until you have been in San Diego for the ninety days required to make venue appropriate. Most of us here in San Diego do free consultations, so I would suggest finding an attorney you are comfortable with as soon as you arrive in town. Your attorney can help avoid any garnishment issues if something does come up.\n\nAs far as your student loans, you will certainly have a deferment while you are in any type of bankruptcy. Student loan creditors generally slap that on as soon as they get notice of your filing. We do have attorney down here that will be glad to charge you to help deal with your student loan creditors. Depending on your circumstances, it might be that you can do that on your own. (The money you save can go to paying down the student loans faster!)\n\nHope you have a successful move. You will like San Diego.",
        "I agree with my colleagues. It makes sense for you to wait to file until you relocate to San Diego. Technically, you should live in San Diego for the majority of the 180-day before filing (so 91 days, as you correctly state). If you can, wait the 91 days and then file in San Diego.",
        "If there is no sense of urgency (e.g. garnishment), I would wait until you have relocated to the Southern District and wait ninety days so the venue question doesn't come up when you file. Either way, you are using California exemptions.",
        "It's your decision whether to file in Northern or Southern California. Bankruptcy is a federal system, so the law is essentially the same in either place.\n\nIt will be a pain in the neck for you to be living in San Diego with a case in Northern Cal. You will have to travel for any court appearances. There are probably not likely to be many, but if there are, it's easier to be local.\n\nYou won't need to wait after moving. If you establish a new residence (by moving in), then you're a resident there and you can file."

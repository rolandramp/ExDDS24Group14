        "The instructions are right there on the first page of the interrogatories. Most people find these difficult and very time consuming to answer. If you claim a right to any expense/s from your separate property or community property list the set of facts on a separate page and label it and attach it. Separate property is property acquired prior to marriage, by gift, bequest, etc. and community property is any property earned during the marriage. I suggest you schedule a consultation with an attorney if you are having a difficult time. Use Avvo to find an attorney you are comfortable with.",
        "Why are you self represented? If your spouse has an attorney, then you should have one also and there is a possibility that the spouse will need to pay for your attorney fees or if there is enough cash in the CP estate, then the CP estate could pay for your fees. But, the intent of this question is to determine if you are asking for any reimbursements to either your SP investments or to the CP for debts or other obligations. If you don't know, then this is a strong indication that you need the help of a family law attorney."

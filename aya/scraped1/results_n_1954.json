    "title": "Is it necessary to publish in a local newspaper the announcement of a death and notify readers of a deadline for debt claims?",
    "question": "If this action is necessary, how much time do I give between now and the deadline? By simply publishing this announcement in the newspaper, does that take care of the legal responsibility? I am the trustee of the family trust. I feel confident that there are no unknown creditors, but if a debt is brought against the estate that exceeds the size of her estate what financial liability do I have?",
    "answers": [
        "No. publication not required if trust is to be administered without court supervision.\nYes. Publication required if estate is probated.\nIf claims are properly addressed in probate or trust administration, you have no personal liability to creditors.",
        "If you are administrating a trust, there is no requirement that you publish notice in a newspaper. This is only needed if a petition to probate an estate is filed for probating a Will or under intestacy. You do have an obligation to search the decedent's records and finances to ascertain if any debts need to be paid. After 4 months, then you could distribute the estates assets as per the terms of the trust.",
        "If an estate is opened in the courts (probate), then published notice is required. There are different requirements for different jurisdictions (i.e., number of notices required).\n\nAny claim assessed that exceeds the net probate estate will not be satisfied from non-probate assets. There are certain priority claims, as well. So, if this happens, your attorney will know how to advise you.",
        "You do not need to publish notice unless there is a probate. You will not be personally responsible for any debt at all and any debt that exceeds the value of the estate will go unpaid."

    "title": "What happens if a corporation dissolves during a wage claim filed with DLSE ? if filed a wage claim is counted as litigation?",
    "question": "the defendant Inc. filed a certification of dissolution with secretary of state during a wage claim filed with DLSE. Inc. neither appears on conference nor on hearing, neither pays ODA nor file appeal. once the ODA becomes judgment, who pays the judgment creditor? Is any California law allowing the corporation files dissolution when knew there is a wage claim ?",
    "answers": [
        "Even if the corporation dissolves legitimately, you still have a claim against its assets. If it has distributed assets to its shareholders, they are liable to its unpaid creditors up to the amount of the distribution.",
        "Try talking to the DLSE about this. Also consult an employment law atty. If there are other employees in your boat, it may be worth getting all together to hire one atty. Check w/ Phil Griego at 408-293-6341. Tell him I referred you.",
        "Unfortunately, many small employers play a shell game as a strategy to avoid liability. It works unless you are motivated to keep chasing them down through fraudulent conveyance/transfer litigation, alter ego findings and the like.\n\nThere is nothing inherently unlawful about a company dissolving with actual and contingent debts on the books. However, what is unlawful is if that corporation takes its remaining assets and removes them from the dissolved corporation for less than full value as a method of avoiding its legitimate debts.\n\nGood luck to you.",
        "The corporation is entitled to dissolve itself anytime, notwithstanding any claims or potential claims against it.\n\nCA Corporations Code section 12650 provides that the directors and officers of a corporation in dissolution can continue the conduct of the affairs of the corporation insofar as necessary for the disposal or winding up, to pay and settle claims against the corporation, and to defend lawsuits brought against the corporation.\n\nIt is sometimes possible that the dissolved corporation magically reappears as a new corporation doing the same business at the same location with the dissolved corporation's assets and employees. Under such circumstances, the judgment creditor might have to file a fraudulent conveyance lawsuit against the new corporation to recover on the wage claimant's DLSE judgment."

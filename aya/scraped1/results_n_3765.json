    "title": "I am defending a credit card lawsuit with a Junk debt buyer and they have not responded to my discovery request at all. What now",
    "question": "I sought advice and responded to all of their discovery, & served my own Req. for Adm, Req. for Prod of docs and Form Interrog. Served them 12/31/13. Nothing has been received to date. Trial date is set for 6/6/14. Plaintiff has hired a local lawyer who shows up for the CM and Settlement conf. hearings but appears confused about the case. Plaintiff is LVNV Funding & atty is Nelson Kennard. I have read that I should NOT file a Motion to Compel, instead, I should wait and answer any of their filings till trial. They have not responded, so it appears that all of my Req. for Adm. should be deemed \"admitted\" - is that correct? I've also been told that I need to file a motion to compel immediately and a \"general motion\" to get the Req. for adm actually Admitted. Pls help - best next step",

        "I agree you should reach out to the other side and give them an opportunity to respond to your discovery requests.\n\nYou may want to consider letting them know that if they fail to respond to your requests then you intend to file a motion to compel discovery. It may be to your advantage to contact a debt collection or consumer protection attorney in your area to look at the status of the case.",
        "I agree with Mr. Fleischman (as I frequently do!)",
        "The proper step is to file Motion to Compel and request to have the RFA's deemed admitted and also seek sanctions against the other party for failure to respond. It would not be wise for you to duplicate this behavior against them since they are not responding to you.",
        "Failure to respond to discovery requests of any kind (interrogatories, RFAs, etc.) may trigger your ability to make a motion to compel OR a motion to deem the RFAs admitted. Regardless, you should reach out to the other side in an attempt to get them to respond to your discovery demands. Depending on the resolution you're going to seek in court, you may have a \"meet and confer\" requirement. That doesn't usually apply when it comes to RFAs, but even in this situation it would effectively take away the other side's defense to a motion."

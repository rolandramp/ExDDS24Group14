    "title": "Involuntary lien? what is it exactly and can I file bankruptcy?",
    "question": "I owed $2300 years ago to one company. Another company SFM 6 LLC I guess bought the debt and wanted $13000. I refused to pay that much and told them I would settle for the original amount of $2300. They refused that. That was almost 2 years ago. Now I received a letter from County of Sacramento internal services agency notifying me that I may have an involuntary lien against me by that creditor. I don't have the money they're trying to get. I don't own any property. I may want to buy a home in the next couple of years. What can I do to get rid of this? Is bankruptcy an option?",

        "You need the \"back and forth\" with a BK lawyer to help you sort out your options. That said, BK will allow you to avoid the involuntary judgment lien and discharge the debt. Remember, BK is more than checking boxes on forms you find online. Find/consult/hire a lawyer using the Avvo feature \"Find a Lawyer\". Make a list of 4-5 having many 5 star reviews from satisfied clients. If you don't get a prompt call back from one, go on to the next on your list. Some offer a free consultation by phone or in person.",
        "I agree that if you don't currently own property then there is nothing for the lien to attach to, however, you will want to take care of this before you own property. You will need to speak to an attorney to determine if you qualify to file for bankruptcy and which chapter would be best for your current financial situation.",
        "Since you don't own any real estate, there is nothing for the lien to attach to yet. But it will attach as soon as you do buy real estate. Now is the time to consider bankruptcy. I suggest that you talk to a bankruptcy attorney to consider your options.",
        "Potentially. There are other confidential facts you'll want to discuss with a bankruptcy attorney. A no cost consultation should help you decide how to best proceed."

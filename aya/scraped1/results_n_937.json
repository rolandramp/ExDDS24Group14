    "title": "Can I file an *Amended* Objection to Claim in my Bankruptcy case?",
    "question": "I filed an objection to claim in my bankruptcy case. I realized that my objection did not include certain figures and relevant facts/allegations, which is why I need to amend my objection. The hearing date (established in the orig objection to claim) is more than 45 days out. Can I simply file an amended objection to claim? Do I need to seek leave of the court to do so?",
    "answers": [
        "No need to seek leave of the Court in order to amend your objection. Just file an amended objection and serve it on the necessary parties.\nI strongly suggest that you seek advise of a local bankruptcy attorney concerning the merit and form of your objection.",
        "Yes, you can file an amended objection and serve it on the creditor, trustee and any other interested parties.",
        "I agree with the other two attorneys, but if you are filing an objection, you really need an attorney. This is pretty sophisticated stuff. Without proper litigation counsel, you are wasting everybody's time, including your own."

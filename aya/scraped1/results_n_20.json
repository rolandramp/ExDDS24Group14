        "If the debts were incurred during marriage while living together or contract entered into during marriage while living in CA or another community property state it is both your debts no matter what. If you agreed to pay something in a divorce, then discuss with your attorney about dischargeability of that in bankruptcy, ch 7 vs ch 13, etc too. We cannot understand though all the facts and the best thing to do is go sit down with a bankruptcy attorney near you in CA to look at your options.\n\nYour asking that question implies you have not called and discussed with an experienced bankruptcy attorney near you as you would or should know the answer to that question posted here on AVVO. Other facts and issues can gravely affect your case so I will point these out for you next some issues so you know you only need to do one thing now: call an attorney near you to discuss bankruptcy. You need and want to enjoy your fresh start also. But the most important thing is to meet with an attorney as you asking this question means you have not. You care about 2 goals: keeping everything you have equity in and discharging all your debts. If you don't have any of the exceptions to discharge you will obtain that goal; most exceptions are set forth in 11 USC. 523 (Google it) like child support, some income taxes, traffic (in a ch 7) and criminal fines , and presumption of student loans. But some debts are dischargeable in a ch 13 but NOT in a ch 7 so you want to make sure and your attorney will discuss any such types with you also!\n\nYour exemptions depend on what state you have lived in in the last 2 years and thus if in your state, then your states exemptions will apply. Most persons filing keep everything they own but your attorney will confirm that with you when they learn everything you own and the equity thereof!\n\nSome secured debts like homes, vehicles, other secured debts an attorney will discuss your options on also as you must list any debts; but that does not mean you will lose them unless you have too much equity or are in default on paying for them! Discuss those options if they apply with your attorney too.\n\nBut other issues can arise that can greatly harm your case. Just one example: If you paid back a relative $3,000 11 months ago and now file bankruptcy next week, the trustee can SUE that relative to retrieve that $3,000 (under what is called a preference) for the benefit of the bankruptcy estate. As a result, most attorneys don't charge to meet with them the first meeting so meet with one no matter what.\n\nMany great attorneys can be found right here on AVVO in your state so look, call, and meet one as soon as you can.\n\nYou should also want to know when to file: is there an advantage of waiting versus filing now and who should you pay between now and then! Good luck and enjoy your later fresh start.",
        "As long as the two of you are married, you can file a joint bankruptcy case and get rid of the debt as to both. The only question I would have is whether one of you was ordered in family court to pay the debt. If so, technically the creditor could come in and try to enforce that order. On the other hand, 1.) it would be unlikely to happen and 2.) you could just amend the agreement to remove the order saying who would pay a non-mortgage unsecured debt.",
        "Some clarification is needed to give you useful advice. I am assuming your question is: Are you responsible for your wife's debts when your marriage is on rocky ground?

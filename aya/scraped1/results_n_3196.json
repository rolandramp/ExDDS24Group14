    "title": "No money to defend in civil lawsuit. Should I wave the white flag?",
    "question": "I was sued for a good amount of money by someone. And I am already out of funds defending myself, and there hasnt even been a trial yet. I can no longer afford legal representation. I am a college student with a part time job, no assets. If I loose i will have no choice but to file bankruptcy since i dont have anything to pay with. My question is if I decide to wave to white flag rather then spend money i dont have to deffend myself, how do i go about it? I dont understand what the otherside expects to get from me since I have nothing to give.",

        "If you can prove to the other side that you don't have anything to give, they may be willing to drop it. This doesn't mean just telling them you're a college student. For example, I recently had a client in your situation who had filed bankruptcy the year before; sending those documents to the other side helped us in our negotiations. It's up to you to decide how best to prove you don't have funds to the other side - there's no science to it. If you have a recent copy of a credit report showing that you have a lot of school debt or credit card debts, bank statements showing you haven't had more than a couple hundred dollars in your account at any given time for the last six months, credit card statements that show your spending habits are minimal, maybe a collections letter if you've been late with a car payment or a recent eviction - all those sorts of documents might be evidence you want to show the other side. Be careful though, since you don't want to inadvertently alert them that you DO have assets (for example, if you have $5,000 in your bank account, they're going to want it in exchange for a settlement, even if you need it to pay your school tuition).\n\nYou can also post on here the claims against you and try to get advice as to how difficult it will be for the other side to prove their case. At a bare minimum, make sure you file an answer to the complaint - you can download a sample online and review it to make sure it makes sense - so that your default is not taken and they're forced to go to trial to get a judgment. It sounds like you've paid an attorney already, so hopefully he or she has done that for you.",
        "Agree with other counsel's responses. Also, be aware that some claims (fraud for example) are may not be discharged in Bankruptcy.",
        "I wouldn't give up so soon. And in any case, there isn't a white flag procedure which you could implement. If your prior attorney filed an answer to the complaint, the plaintiff can't take your default. You will just have to await the trial date. The plaintiff still has the burden of proving a case against you. If this is your only debt, it is generally not advisable to file for bankruptcy. The worse case scenario is that the plaintiff will ultimately obtain a judgment against you for some sum of money, but won't be able to collect the judgment. Options you have at this point (other than filing for bankruptcy) include stipulating for a judgment for a lesser amount. But I wouldn't give up so soon. The plaintiff's demand will likely become more realistic once the trial date becomes more imminent.",
        "What is the legal issue? You can do your best and represent yourself. You can also get fee waivers from the court to file things without payment. Or you can try and settle with the other party and work something out where you pay a bit each month. I know it is tough, but you might as well try and follow through/fight back, since you have nothing to lose at this point."

        "A score of 632 will generally improve within a year of a BK as long as no more negatives hit your credit.

        "Your credit score is based on many factors. In my experience, by the time a person is ready to file Chapter 7, they are behind in their debts and their credit score has already taken a hit.

Prompt payments post bankruptcy on secured debts will go a long way in increasing your score. As far as your credit score affecting your ability to rent, that is an unanswerable question because different landlords use different ways to evaluate tenants. Large, corporate owned operations screen tenants differently than owners of a small duplex or fourplex for example.

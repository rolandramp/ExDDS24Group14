    "title": "What is the best way to find a an affordable bankruptcy attorney?",
    "question": "I just had a free consultation from a bankruptcy attorney she was very helpful but unfortunately I cannot afford her fees. She charges $2300 to handle everything including the creditors meeting at the end but she basically needs me to pay the entire $2300 before the actual filing. Apparently my BK would be pretty easy according to her I owe many credit cards but they are all small balances averaging $500-2000. I also owe $75,000 to the IRS and $9,000 to state board of equalization. I do not have any assets and my bank account has very little in it.",
    "answers": [
        "I understand that when you have financial issues, you don't have the desire or funds to pay for an attorney. However, bankruptcy is a very specific area of the law that requires an experienced bankruptcy attorney to assist you in working through the case successfully. Many of us offer a no charge half hour consultation - I understand you have tried that but weren't satisfied with the fee quoted. Try others of us. Understand that almost 100% of the legal work required is completed prior to filing the case. Thus, the request for payment up front. The lowest quote you received was probably from a paralegal service or a law firm that has you talking only to a paralegal - not an attorney. I urge you to not go that route. You need the legal advice available from an attorney that a paralegal cannot provide. Search further for assistance.",
        "There are companies that can finance your bankruptcy that provide for payments of about $200/month if you qualify. However, nothing is more expensive than deciding to hire a cheap attorney. Mom always said you get what you pay for. There is a reason some attorneys offer cheap prices, and I don't know why anyone would be surprised to discover that they provide less than you paid for their services. Hope this perspective helps!",
        "I don't practice anywhere near you(I [practice in the ED of NC), but even here, where the going rate is likely cheaper than in California, you could not find an attorney who has any clue of what they're doing to take your case for a total fee including filing and other required fees for $800, especially given that you have $80k+ in tax debt. You need to re-evaluate how much you can pay if you want to get a good attorney who can advise you the best way to discharge that huge tax debt, assuming it is dischargeable.",
        "Given where you apparently live, Riverside CA, your budget is wildly unrealistic. All you can do is call other bankruptcy attorneys. However, at the end of the day, you are not required to hire an attorney. As with all things, you can either afford the item or you can't. If you can't, then you can't buy it. You not having money to afford an attorney doesn't make you a charity case such that an attorney should reduce your fees. Your individual financial hardship is not a matter of public interest.",
        "With that kind of tax liability, $2300 is an eminently fair fee. Those $795 lawyers are offering c'mon fees. By the time they add on the extras that other lawyers include as part of their standard fee, you will be paying the same or more. Up front fees are standard. Every time I have violated that rule I have been burned. Either save up your money or hit up friends and family.",
        "I’m going just throw some things out... if your budget is $800 and the filing fee in $335... you want to pay less than $500 to pay for attorneys fees... that’s like paying for 3-5 hours of work to do an entire bankruptcy? Just pointing out what would be realistic ideas of this...",
        "The best approach is to talk to several experienced attorneys, see who you are most comfortable with, and hire that attorney.\n\nOne issue that I see is that you owe back taxes. The tax issue has to be carefully evaluated to make sure that you file the case when the taxes can be discharged (typically, 3 years after they become due). An experienced attorney will evaluate this and give you advice about WHEN to file your case in order to discharge $84,000 in tax debt. Since you can only file a chapter 7 case once every 8 years, find someone who will do the job correctly.",
        "No easy answer. Best wishes in finding the right lawyer.",
        "The filing fee for a chapter 7 case is $335 not $306. Attorney fees are negotiable. Remember, BK is more than checking boxes on forms you find online. Find/consult/hire a lawyer in your area using the Avvo feature \"Find a Lawyer\". Make a list of 4-5 having many 5 star reviews from satisfied clients. If you don't get a prompt call back from one, go on to the next on your list. Some offer a free consultation by phone or in person. Take us up on it.\n\nBecause the bankruptcy process can be handled entirely by phone, email and fax, there is no need to personally visit the lawyer’s office unless you want to. Don’t be limited by the location of the BK lawyers you select.",
        "You should talk to the the attorney about your concerns and questions you have and find if they are able to adequately address your concerns. It sounds like your spoke to attorney already and have a good understanding of what your case involves. Unfortunately, there is no other advice that can be given on this as everyone different circumstances, requirements and preferences."

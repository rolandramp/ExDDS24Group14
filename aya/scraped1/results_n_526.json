    "title": "IRS garnished my tax refund and applied to a previous debt. Can they do that?",
    "question": "I filed for chapter 13 bankruptcy in the beginning of February of this year and filed my taxes at the end of February of this year for 2018. The IRS garnished my refund and applied it to a previous debit. I thought they couldn't garnish anything while I am under the automatic stay. Is it possible to recover that refund or is it gone? Finally if I file next year and I'm still making my payments to the trustee can the IRS still garnish any potential refunds for 2019 and apply it to previous debts?",

        "It's called a setoff ... and it's legal. They can apply taxes collected prior to the BK to taxes owed prior to the BK. But they can't do it with taxes collected after the BK filing date, so your future refunds should come to you."

        "This question appears to be based upon a false understanding as to what CP is. CP is anything acquired during the marriage and it doesn't matter whose name was on it. You still need to declare your separate property though so you need to go ahead and file an FL-160 for separate property and you need to declare to your spouse what you are claiming is your separate property. Please seek legal assistance.",
        "The Schedule of Assets and Debts (FL-142) is critical in order to proceed with your divorce. Do not sweat the Property Declaration (FL-160). That does not need to be filed in order to proceed in either a contested case or an uncontested case. However, you both need to do the FL-142 and serve it upon one another.\n\nGood luck!",
        "Both you and your wife will need to complete and serve preliminary disclosures, so you should use the FL-142, as opposed to the FL-160.\n\nYou must list all assets and debts, even if they are your separate property. You can indicate separate or community property on the form itself."

    "title": "2 YEARS INTO CHAPTER 13 PYMTS ON TIME FILED A MOTION TO INCUR DEBT IN SAN DIEGO.",
    "question": "I am two years into a chapter 13 bankruptcy. My bankruptcy payments are on track and I am doing fine. I was renting a vehicle for a while but the vehicle has become unreliable and I cannot sustain maintaining a rental for the entire time I am in Chapter 13. I applied for a loan and was approved and submitted to my lawyer the details of the loan for the car I want to buy. In addition I am a 100% repay of my loan which should end in about 19 months.",

        "If I understand that you are repaying your unsecured creditors 100%, then I doubt there will be any objection to the purchase. It's just too bad the law can't be written so that a debtor wouldn't have to incur additional attorney fees just to make a necessary purchase when the debtor is paying a large percentage to unsecured claims, which it sounds as though you are.\n\nIt could be really beneficial, if , due to changing circumstances, you absolutely needed to make a purchase and consequently moved to modify your Chapter 13 plan and DECREASE the percentage paid to unsecured creditors. Of course, the trustees would go crazy but if you win (which is possible} it would be well worth the additional attorney fees.",
        "It is really up to the judge to look at your income and expenses, whether you are up to date with your plan payments, whether the Trustee consents and whether anyone objects to you motion to incur. If you are buying something similar to what you have now for a similar payment then that is generally not a problem. If you are buying a luxury vehicle for a big payment then that can be a problem.",
        "If you are replacing your sole means of transportation, and the payment is approximately the same as you were paying for a rental, then you should be able to get approval, especially when you're paying your creditors back in full. You'll need a motion to approve the post-petition credit.\nThat said, I would advise you as a practical matter to buy a car in the $15,000 range. You're just climbing out of one deep hole, why start digging a new one?",
        "First, you need to look at any local rules governing that issue. In Washington for example, we have a specific court rule on when a person wants to purchase a vehicle incurring debt post petition.\n\nSecondly call the chapter 13 trustee's office now even in case you need to add some other documents to your pleadings.\n\nThird, in a 100% case it always a better case no matter what. If you were renting a car before and now the vehicle payment is about the same you are in the same position IF YOU DONT DEFAULT. Noone can say what a judge would do or how much they would agree to.. I bet if it was a $10,000 car and $250 in payments they would say yes..but I don't know and a 100% case with 2 years into it puts you in a great position.\n\nFinally, the biggest reason is whether or not any one objects! If no objection, then I don't know you filed the proposed order or your local rule on that. But that is why you should ask ch 13 even now to fix any problems in case it can be done! Good luck."

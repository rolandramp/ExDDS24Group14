        "If Main Street Acquisitions has a valid judgment, it is able to \"execute\" the judgment in various ways, such as levying your bank account and garnishing your wages.\n\nIf you were never served with a summons and complaint, it may be possible to \"set aside the default\" which means that Main Street would no longer have a judgment and would have to start from the beginning (trying to serve you with the summons and complaint). However depending on when you first knew about the judgment, it may be too late. A defendant must act promptly when he/she learns that there is a court judgment. Also, there are costs and attorney's fees associated with doing that.\n\nIf you cannot set aside the judgment, you may want to consider a bankruptcy case to discharge the debt.",
        "At this point, it's perfectly legal. You may be able to set aside the judgment if you can show that the papers weren't served properly on you...but this is difficult. Speak with a local attorney.",
        "Yes the is legal if they have obtained a court judgment. Attorney Salanick laid out your options. If you have other debts as well it might be time to see a bankruptcy attorney.",
        "Three options I see :\n\n1) motion to vacate judgment for lack if proper service, and plan to defend lawsuit\n\n2) claim of exemption if the funds that we're take can be proven to be required for you necessary living expenses\n\n3) bankruptcy with exemption applied to levied and garnished monies so long as you have available exemptions remaing, and all other factors aligned with an ability to file bankruptcy without forfeiting no exempt assets, or too high income, etc., etc. Under certain scenarios, filing bankruptcy may help you to recover any monies levied or garnished within the 90 days immediately proceeding the date your case is filed.\n\nTalk to a lawyer or two directly to more completely help you understand these options and choose the best path forward."

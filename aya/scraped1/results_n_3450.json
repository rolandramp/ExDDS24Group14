    "title": "Can I file Chapter 7 bankruptcy for property damage before restitution is set?",
    "question": "2 years ago, I hit 2 PG&E poles and was charged with a DUI. PG&E has filed a restitution order against me for $200,000+. I only make about $1,000 a month and cannot pay that amount. Is it possible to file bankruptcy to discharge the debt before the judge orders me to pay? If not, is it possible to have the amount lowered?",
    "answers": [
        "Only DUI injuries for death or personal injury are non dischargeable under 523(a)(9). Actual pecuniary loss is also discharged under Section (a)(7). It does not matter if the judge order it is or not from a bankruptcy point. From a criminal point, if the court orders restitution and it is not paid the judge in criminal court can proceed but you want to let him know the debt was discharged in ch 7!! So get it filed . Find an experienced attorney here on AVVO like Attorney Larkin or others!",
        "As far as the criminal aspect is concerned, court ordered restitution must be paid. If you disagree about the amount, you can have a formal hearing to dispute the amount, but good luck finding someone to counter-quote a light pole estimate.\n\nHere's the thing, on a first offense DUI, the max the judge can sentence you to is 180 days county jail. You'd get half time. Fail to pay restitution, 90 days would be the max sentence for doing so. A second or third misd DUI it's 1 year..\n\n... got to say, if someone offered me 200k to go to jail for 90 days.......",
        "The first question needs to be asked of a bankruptcy attorney, whereas the second to a criminal defense attorney. Avvo has a listing of such persons; they may be able to advise upon your providing additional information.",
        "Court ordered restitution cannot be discharged via bankruptcy proceedings. You may be able to negotiate with PG&E to lower the amount. Assuming your case is only a misdemeanor DUI, there is really no leverage compelling you to pay. Given your income, you might consider making restitution payments of $50/month for the rest of your natural life.",
        "On the criminal defense side of things, it depends on where the case is as to what can be done. If there hasn't been a restitution order yet, your attorney may be able to request a hearing to contest the amount (or even possible liability--depending on what has happened in the case this far). If there already has been a restitution order, your only recourse may be to appeal. Consult with your attorney about how to proceed. If you haven't got one, it is far past time to get one.\n\nAs for what bankruptcy could do for you, you will need to ask a bankruptcy attorney. It is my understanding that the discharge of debts that are the result of criminal acts can be very tricky. I will change the listing of this post so that bankruptcy attorneys may see it.\n\nMeet with both a criminal defense and bankruptcy lawyer to consult with them about this matter."

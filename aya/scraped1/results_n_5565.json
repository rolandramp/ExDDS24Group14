    "question": "The judgment was entered against the corporation when it was still active. A few months after the judgment, the corporation was dissolved. In the corporation's filing for dissolution with the Sec. of State, it stated that all liabilities have been taken care of, which isn't true for this judgment.",

        "The answer to your specific question is, it is very difficult (maybe impossible) to collect from a dissolved entity.

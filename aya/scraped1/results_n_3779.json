    "title": "Can co-signing for a car affect my social security, retirement, or my reverse mortgage",
    "question": "I Co-signed for my adult niece to get a new vehicle to help them build credit while they were living with me. They moved out of state and stopped paying their bills dodging my calls and emails. I cannot afford to pay for it. My question is besides messing up my credit can it also affect my social security, retirement, or my reverse mortgage and what can I do about it also do I have a small claim court case.",

        "In addition to the other very good answer, let the lienholder know where the car is so they can re-possess it.",
        "1) Social Security -- Not likely, unless you put your social security payments into a bank account which has been set up for a sweep (levy), but this can only happen after the creditor has won a judgment against you and actually gone ahead with a bank sweep levy.\n2) Retirement -- Perhaps, but only insofar as your retirement accounts can be attached or levied upon if the creditor ends up filing suit against you and winning a judgment.\n3) Reverse mortgage payments-- Perhaps, but only after there has been a judgment won against you and only after the creditor has sought to enforce the judgment by way of levy.\n\nIn most cases I have seen where the amount in question isn't over $50,000, the banks holding title on the cars usually just repossess the vehicle, chase after the debtors to the extent it isn't expensive to do so, and if they have no success squeezing money from them without legal fees, they typically write off the debts and move on.\n\nYes, your credit will be damaged. And yes, you can theoretically be levied upon if the creditor wins a judgment against you and moves to levy against your assets-- but like I said, it's usually not likely unless the amounts are substantial."

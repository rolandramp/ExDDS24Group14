    "title": "Can I file an Answer to Def Opposition to my Claim of Exemption (Bank Levy) before hearing set 2 months from now?",
    "question": "Credit card co. secured default judgment 2009 without my knowledge. I was not served. Further, I moved out of state and did not receive any communication seeking collection. Def secured bank levy Jan. 2013. I filed claim of exemption. Def filed Opposition, court hearing set for 4/16. (They filed opposition 2/20 but were served notice by levying officer 2/5. Thought they had 10 days to file?) Their Opposition states inaccurate references to my claim of exemption, which clearly shows that I have 0 income but they inaccurately state that it shows income, and other inaccurate references. I am financially destitute, recently unemployed. Please advise if I can expedite remedy by filing an Answer to their Opposition before the 4/16 hearing & seek earlier date.",

        "Regarding the Motion to Vacate; first you need to pull the court file and find the affidavit of service. Second, if you can't find the form on the courts website, then no form exists. Generally, standard forms for motions are not provided because Motions are not standardized. At its core, a Motion is simply a request to have the court (judge) do something. In your situation, you are asking the judge to set aside the judgment, but a Motion can be for almost anything.\n\nHowever, for a judge to grant the motion, you (as the moving party) need to provide both a basis in (1) FACT and (2) LAW to justify the request. Keep in mind, on the one side, you have an affidavit of service which is a sworn statement stating that you were served (assuming one is in the file), and then the firm has a prove-up to support the default judgment. You cannot counter that with \"I don't remember being served.\" You need to have some specific facts (e.g. I was in Florida visiting my sick aunt, here are the credit card statements showing the charges for the airline tickets and hotel reservations for the time they claimed I was served).\n\nEven if you win the motion to vacate, all it means the case simply proceeds.\n\nBest regards.",
        "I agree with my colleague. There is no such thing as an answer to opposition. Yet, you can file a reply to opposition and include a memorandum of points and authorities. Good luck with your case.\n\nMarcus W. Morales, Esq.\n115 W. Mission St.\nSanta Barbara, CA 93101\nwww.marcusmoraleslaw.com\n(805) 845-5405",
        "You can file a \"Reply\" to the creditor's opposition, but that will not advance the hearing date.\n\nIf you were not served, you need to file a motion to vacate. Non-service is not relevant in a Claim of Exemption proceeding."

    "title": "Should we sign a stipulation to judgement and allow an abstract to be placed on my home.",
    "question": "We were served with a suit on 5/26 by a collection agency for an old hospital bill that should have been reduced by a class action suit. The collection agency called us yesterday after reviewing the class action discounts and agreed to a settlement amount. Because we cannot pay the settlement amount in full, they agreed to a somewhat higher amount and said they will not dismiss the suit, but will send us a stipulation to judgement to sign and will then place an abstract on our home which will protect their interest if we sell the home or take a loan on it. The stipulation for judgement agrees to a monthly payment that we will review after six months. Is this a smart thing to sign rather than filing an answer for ourselves? Can we still include it if we decide to file bankruptcy later?",

        "My advise is to have an experienced lawyer review the documents. A Stipulation for Judgment is an agreement which is not filed with the Court unless you default on a settlement agreement. Because they are telling you they plan to immediately put an abstract of judgment on your house my impression is that they are talking about a \"Confession of Judgment\" which is an immediate judgment against you and your spouse. They may be attempting to get you to sign a \"Confession of Judgment\" but calling it a \"Stipulation for Judgment\".\n\nRobert M.

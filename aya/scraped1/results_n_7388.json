    "question": "My mother has an irrevcoable living which says that upon her death the house becomes mine. Say in the meantime while she is alive a creditor files a lien against my mother's house for an unpaid credit card bill. After she has passed do I have to pay that lien for the house to transfer to my name or with the trust in place will it transfer automatically? and can I have it removed since it had nothing to do with me?",
    "answers": [
        "It depends on whether the irrevocable trust was written in such a way as to defeat the claims of your mother's creditors as well as whether your mother establishing such an asset protection trust would amount to a \"fraudulent transfer\" that her creditors could avoid.\nIn short... maybe, it depends.\nSeek local counsel to develop the facts and let you know which way the wind is blowing.",
        "You describe her trust as an \"irrevocable living trust\" which may affect whether or not a lien can attach to the property at all. If the trust is truly irrevocable, and if the house is in that irrevocable trust because of a transfer by someone other than your mother, and if the trust has a spendthrift clause to protect assets from the beneficiary's creditors, then a credit card lien cannot attach to the house. [For example, if Mom and Dad had a joint living trust, Dad died and on his death the trust split into an irrevocable \"bypass trust\" and a revocable survivor's trust, the assets in the bypass trust are protected from creditors of the surviving spouse.]\n\nIf you meant to describe the trust as a \"revocable living trust\" (meaning that your mother has created it with her own assets and still has the right to revoke it), then all assets in the trust are exposed to claims by her creditors. Those debts will have to be paid at her death, from whatever assets are available in her estate. Either way, if the trust has the house going to you on her death, it will come to you, but it might be subject to the claims of creditors at that time.\n\nYou should consider consulting with an experienced trusts and estates attorney, or an elder law attorney, if you have any concerns.",
        "You do not have to pay the lien to transfer the house to your name after mom dies. But the lien will still be there, and if you ever sell or refinance the house, then the lien will get paid. You will not be able to remove the lien arguing that it is not your debt. Once a lien has attached to your mom's asset it will follow that asset even if she dies."

    "title": "Can i file for bankruptcy if I owe unemployment back pay of 16k? How will filing for bankruptcy effect my credit?",
    "question": "Stupid mistakes done in my 20s. Now that I'm in my 30s I want to buy a house within the next 2yrs. My overall debt is under 20k. Most of it is from my unemployment back pay. I was claiming unemployment and working part time. Now I owe about 16k of unemployment. This debt also includes a repo.",
    "answers": [
        "I have found that the easiest place to finance the purchase of a home after bankruptcy is through a local credit union. In Nevada, unemployment is unlikely to challenge your bankruptcy. But it can happen. Hope this perspective helps!",
        "Agree with atty Firth, except for the unemployment debt. It is possible that this debt's discharge could be challenged by the creditor if they can show fraud on your part by continuing to collect while you were employed. I suggest an in depth consultation with a BK lawyer. Some of us offer a free consultation by phone or in person. Take us up on it. BK is not a DIY project, especially in view of your circumstances.",
        "It is my understanding that you can get rid of overpaid unemployment in a bankruptcy and certainly get rid on any deficiency owed for the repo. Whether that can get you in to a house within two years is problematic. The lenders always seem to be changing the rule. Consult with your mortgage broker or mortgage lender to determine how far back the bankruptcy has to be.",
        "All of the attorneys have touched on the reality that discharging the unemployment may be a bit of a gray area. It might depend in part on whose desk your bankruptcy file winds up on with the State and how much of an issue they want to make out of it. If you do have to respond to an adversarial proceeding in order to discharge the unemployment, I would recommend getting a lawyer. There should be no issue on the repo assuming there was no fraud either.",
        "You should consult a bankruptcy attorney. More information is required to assess why you were claiming unemployment and working part time. Fraud can be difficult to prove, however, if fraud is proved, you may not be able to get the unemployment back pay wiped out. Your situation is unique and I would consult with a bankruptcy attorney to go over the details. Many of us offer free and confidential consultations. Consider taking us up on that."

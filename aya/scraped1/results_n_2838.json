    "title": "How can I collect on a debt owed by a friend?",
    "question": "I lent a friend several thousand dollars over a year ago. He has paid $1,000, and is impossible to reach by phone or e-mail or mail, because he won't respond to calls or letters.",

        "I think you mean that you loaned money to an \"ex friend.\"\n\nConsider yourself lucky you got back $1000. You can go Small Claims court. It is a good remedy, assuming you still know where he works.\n\nA collection agency will keep 30% or more of what is collected. But the amount owed is too small for them to ever sue. I would not use an agency.\n\nHere's what I would do:\n\nFind out if the guy is still employed. If he is, call him at work. Let him know you are ready to sue him, that you will have the sheriff's office serve him at his job, and after you win in court, you intend to garnish his wages. If you can get him on the phone, be prepared for nonsense, such as \"ill quit my job and you won't get anything.\" I would tell him he can quit if he wants to, since the way things are going you're not getting paid anyway. But I would reinforce your point that you loaned him money when he needed it, that loaning the money was a hardship on you, but you did it because his was a friend and he gave you his word he would return the money, that you are sorry that he is going through a rough patch, and you are willing to accept a reasonable payment schedule to help him out, if it can be agreed upon immediately.\n\nGood luck.",
        "You will need to find the defendant. You may need to hire the services of an investigator. If you can find where he lives or where he works, you can file a lawsuit and serve him. You will get to court in about 5 - 6 weeks if you file in Small Claims. If you hire a lawyer and file a civil lawsuit in Superior Court, the case will get to trial in about a year and a half. The maximum limit in Small Claims is $10,000. Once you have a judgment, you will need to collect by levying on a bank account, garnishing wages or executing on other property. Good luck.",
        "If you cannot collect this debt informally, filing a lawsuit is an option. Whether you sue in small claims court or Superior (State) Court will depend on the amount you are owed. If you are in small claims court, you cannot have an attorney in court with you. In Superior Court you are entitled to an attorney. Some attorneys will take a collection case on a contingency basis, getting their fee when the actually collect. But first they must sue the other party and get a judgment against the debtor. I would recommend that you use the Find A Lawyer search function on this website to find an attorney you can speak with regarding this matter. Best of luck to you.",
        "You can file in smallclaims court but will have to serve the guy.\n\nCollection attorneys will work on contingency IF there are assets, but first you need to be able to serve the guy."

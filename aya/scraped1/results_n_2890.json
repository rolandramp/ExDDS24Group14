    "title": "Can I file an adversary proceeding to get my student loans discharged in bankruptcy, or do I need a lawyer to help me do this?",
    "question": "I am married, but I want to file individual bankruptcy to get my student loans discharged, due to undue hardship. I don't have much money to pay a lawyer, so I wanted to find out if I could do this on my own. I am a 61 year old woman, and I went back to school to try to start a career, because my husband's retirement will not be enough for us both to live on. I started grad school in 2007 in hopes of becoming an MFT. My school misrepresented the length of time it would take to complete the degree, and it ended up taking me five years. I have been unable to find employment, and my deferments are running out. I worry that they will take money out of our bank account if I default. I also worry that I will never be able to collect Social Security or Medicare. Thank you for any help!",

        "Ms. Larkin's answer is very much true to the point. Student Loans are very hard to discharge.

        "Student Loan Litigation in the Adversary Proceeding process is difficult. Therefore I agree with some of the other comments made. However, it is not impossible. You will have to prove something more than a financial hardship, because that is all you have described.

You should contact an attorney who has experience in the specialized area of student loan law, as well as bankruptcy law.",

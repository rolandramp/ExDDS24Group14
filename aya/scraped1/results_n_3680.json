    "title": "Will hospital bill with lien go away in bankruptcy?",
    "question": "Got into a car accident, was taken to a hospital from the scene to a nearby hospital by an ambulance and was released same day. Don't have medical insurance. Got chiropractical treatment for a couple of months. Sent all bills to the insurance company, received a settlement check and spent the money. Now, the hospital wants to sue me for the bills saying that they were entitled to some of the money based on their statutory lien pursuant to code section 3045.1, even though I did not sign anything when I was there about paying them. The chiropractor and the ambulance also are sending me bills. I did not sign anythnig with ambulance, but did sign chiropractic lien. So, I think I need to file for bankruptcy. Will hospital bill, ambulance bill, and chiropractor bill go away in chapter 7?",

        "Talk to a BK atty about this. I doubt the hospital perfected its lien, as if it had, the ins co would have paid them. The hospital lien is against the other ins co, not you. I suspect you can discharge that obligation. The chiro lien may not be dischargeable, as arguably it was a secured debt. However, the chiro may not hire an atty or know any better and may just write it off when he gets the BK notice.",
        "I don't practice bankruptcy law and, surprisingly, no one else tagged your question for bankruptcy attorneys; but, I did so.",
        "I agree in part with Attorney Schoen. This is the worst case scenario.\n\nWhen you received the settlement check you knew you had no insurance. And you had to know you were responsible for the medical bills.\n\nIf you received the money as other lawyers have pointed out, you would've been given a release and settlement statement telling you that you were responsible for your own bills. If the money was inadequate you should've hired an attorney and had that attorney settle the case and take care of the liens.\n\nNow on to the rest. Since you spent the money the liens are no good. Does it border on fraudulent? Its possible because you impaired the security rights of the providers. And at least one of them, the Chiro had a lien that you knew of.\n\nWhen you impair someone's security interests you in effect destroy the only thing they could turn to in order to get paid.\n\nIf you sold your car and took back a loan, and had a lien on it, then the buyer turned around and sold it in Mexico, you would have nothing to turn to if the buyer refuses to pay off the loan.\n\nThat's what impairing security interests means.\n\nAnd to the extent their interests were impaired, you could get a discharge from the medical liability, but would likely owe back to your trustee the amount of the settlement up to the liability.\n\nIf you want to steer clear of this in bankruptcy, you may have to file a Chapter 7 first, clear the decks, and then afterwards either convert to a Chapter 13 or get your 7 discharge and then file a 13 to begin paying back the money you spent from the insurance company.",
        "You should consult with a bankruptcy attorney. In order for the hospital to have a valid statutory lien, they must serve a notice of lien to you, your attorney or the insurance company certified, return receipt requested prior to settlement funds being paid. You may find out that the hospital will not be able to provide proof that the lien was properly filed. Good luck.",
        "This sounds like your actions are bordering on the fraudulent. I would be very careful how you proceed from here on out and would consider consulting with a local criminal defense attorney and/or a bankruptcy attorney. I also would not post anything further about this on this site.",
        "You are responsible for your own medical bills. The settlement from the liable third-party included the medical bills and treatment in the settlement. The release agreement likely included an agreement that you would pay the medical providers and defend, indemnify and hold the settling parties harmless from lawsuits arising from the medical bills. You violated a hospital lien for emergency medical services and contractual lien for chiropractic services. You should contact a bankruptcy lawyer to determine if your distribution of settlement without paying the liens would be deemed a fraudulent transfer. If you hired a lawyer to represent you in the first place, all of these issues could have been avoided.",
        "As a general rule unsecured debts are dischargeable in bankruptcy. Statutory liens are not (and they arise by delivery of services under defined circumstances without any signature). For the precise review of these obligations and claims, retain an experienced bankruptcy attorney.\n\nBest wishes for an outcome you can accept, and please remember to designate a best answer."

    "title": "Can a wrongful death judgment be discharged in bankruptcy?",
    "question": "We are considering filing a wrongful death lawsuit. However, we are concerned that the individual will just file for bankruptcy after we get the judgment. Trying to decide if it is worth the pain and money to proceed.",
    "answers": [
        "I just thought I would add to previous answers. It is unfortunate that the DA wouldn't pursue any charges for the wrongful death. Negligent homicide is still a crime. If restitution in a criminal case was ordered (ie., as opposed to a wrongful death award in a civil action), the restitution would be non-dischargeable in bankruptcy. Its definitely worth talking to some attorneys about. Only an attorney that reviews the particulars of your circumstances will be able to give you good, direct advice.",
        "Most debts can be discharged under Section 727 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. A discharge under the Bankruptcy Code does not, however, discharge a debtor from any debt arising from a \"willful and malicious injury by the debtor to another . . .\" (11 USC 523(a)(6)). If the person/entity that caused the wrongful death was insured the debtor's bankruptcy will not discharge the insurer's obligations. You are wise to count the cost of proceeding with litigation. You should, however, consult a competent attorney in your area to discuss the pros and cons of proceeding with litigation.",
        "If there is insurance that is unaffected by bankruptcy. If there is underinsured motorist, same thing. If there is a product liaility aspect the bankruptcy of the defendant won't change things. Also bankruptcies have changed, and you may be able to make a case that a payment plan needs to be worked out. Contact a member of caoc.org who handles death cases and get a free consultation.",
        "There are a lot of issues here and the best course of action would be to speak with an attorney in your state that handles Wrongful Death cases. Without knowing all of the facts of the case, i.e. what insurance is available, who was responsible for the loss and other important facts, no attorney can give you a good answer to this question.",
        "The reasons for not being eligible to discharge a debt are in 11 USC sec 523 but for the most part, you have to file an adversary action within the bankruptcy to avoid a discharge. Sometimes the results of the law are just no fair.",
        "It depends - if the action that caused the death was something serious, like a DUI, intentional act, etc., it is possible to have it rendered non-dischargeable. But, you'll have to launch an adversary action in the person's bankruptcy and have the bankruptcy court agree it's non-dischargeable.",
        "If the wrongful death was caused by some intentional act that may fit into an exception to discharge, then it will survive the bankruptcy. Consult with a bankruptcy attorney for a consultation."

    "question": "My wife recently had her chapter 13 missed for the second time in one year for failing to make her payment in time . This time I elected to file with her as Debtor 1 and she as debtor 2 . and my last filing was in 2013 discharge.Please explain who is protected under the automatic stay , ???who is not and for how long ??",
    "answers": [
        "The automatic stay is in effect during the case (while the case is open) unless the creditor files a \"motion for relief\" from the stay. The stay protects debtors/co-debtors from collection efforts. It sounds like you are a co-debtor.\n\nIn a chapter 13 case, the case will typically remain open as long as the debtor makes the plan payments. If your wife missed a payment, and the trustee filed a motion to dismiss, the court may dismiss the case. If the court dismisses the case the stay is no longer in effect, and creditors can resume collection activities.",
        "I agree with my colleague. There are many detailed rules when it comes to the automatic stay. Generally the automatic stay applies to property, debt, lawsuits, etc in your name, however, if in your wife's case a creditor got in rem relief (such as a mortgage lender or a car lender), then the automatic stay might not put a stay on collection activities by that creditor. Again, very delicate situation after your wife had multiple chapter 13s dismissed. I recommend speaking to an experienced bankruptcy attorney right away.",

    "title": "In chapter 7 bankruptcy in California, using 704 exemptions for homestead, is there anything available to protect a burial plot?",
    "question": "Just wondering how a burial plot might be exempted when using the 704 set of exemptions.",
    "answers": [
        "After listing the cemetery plot in your bankruptcy, you would claim the exemption for burial plots of the debtor or debtor's spouse under CCP 704.200(d) to protect the plot in its entirety. I would recommend that you consult with a bankruptcy attorney if have further questions regarding exemption law, as California offers two sets of exemptions under CCP 703 and CCP 704. Generally if a debtor has equity in real property that is your primary residence, CCP 704 can be used to protect that equity, but it leaves other assets, such as cash, vulnerable.",
        "By reading your question makes me believe you have NOT consulted with a bankruptcy attorney. My advice is to do that. You have only 2 goals: to keep everything you have equity in and to discharge all your debts. But there are other issues that can affect your case substantially and thus obtain bankruptcy advice from an attorney who practices ONLY bankruptcy law and has for many years. If you had done that you would already know the answer to your question. However, other issues can exist. For example, if you paid back your relative $3,000 from a personal loan 11 months ago and file bankruptcy next 2 weeks the trustee in bankruptcy assigned your case most likely will go sue your relatives to retrieve that money!! That is just an example. So obtain good advice by employing a good attorney is my advice for you!",
        "CCP Section 704.200 allows an unlimited exemption for a cemetery plot. It would be most fortuitous if you owned a cemetery plot in Hawaii overlooking the Pacific Ocean which I am told can be worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. Having said that, don't go out and buy one immediately before filing bankruptcy. That would be bankruptcy fraud and could get you an all expense paid visit to \"Club Fed\" (can you tell it is late on Friday afternoon?)",
        "I believe the 704 exemptions do not include the burial plot, but they do include the \"wildcard\" of approx $25K. 703 exemptions specifically include burial plot up to $17K or so."

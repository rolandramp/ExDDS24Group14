        "The art of cross-examination is not an easy one! Lawyers spend years in court developing this technique. First you need to examine the background of the witness?

        "The technique, or some say art, of cross-examining witnesses, and the raising of evidentiary objections, are things that attorneys spend many years learning. That is part of what a litigation attorney can do for you. Those are not things you should attempt on your own, and if you do, your chances of success with your arguments will be very low. This is not an attempt to just give you an evasive answer. This forum is not designed to try to teach someone trial skills or the rules of evidence. It is for general legal questions to assist people in their understanding of their legal options and to aid in making decisions concerning their legal and financial situation. I recommend you do yourself a big favor and consult with and hire a local litigation attorney that can properly represent you in examining the \"keeper of records\" and any other witnesses and to also properly prepare and argue evidentiary objections on your behalf. If the issues, and dollar amount involved, are worth fighting over at all, you would be much better off having an experienced attorney doing the fighting for you."

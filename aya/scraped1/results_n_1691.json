    "title": "I owe back taxes. Can the IRS come after my worker's comp settlement money?",
    "question": "My wife is on medical leave from her job due to a surgery last week. She is currently receiving California SDI of $1,140 per month. I am ending a nasty 2-year long worker's comp claim, and I will be awarded $34,000 this month. I am unemployed, I am NOT collecting unemployment, or Social Security disability. I have NO other sources of regular (EARNED or UNEARNED) income. I owe back taxes. Can the IRS come after my worker's comp settlement money? The IRS has my offer in compromise paperwork and will send me their decision by November. Much of my settlement money will go to pay medical expenses, paying off outstanding debts, and paying multiple months for rent, so we don't have to worry about those things until we get back on our feet. I need some advice!",

        "If you are currently in an offer in compromise, typically there is a \"hold\" or suspension on collection activity while it is being considered at the IRS. This means that it is unlikely they would try to go directly to levy the worker's comp award. Once the money is in your account, it is treated like any other asset.\n\nThe main issue that I do not believe has been addressed yet is that the award from worker's comp can affect your current offer. That money would likely be considered income and may result in recalculating the initial offer amount you submitted. Keep in mind any \"new\" income not previously disclosed needs to be disclosed even if your offer was already submitted.",
        "You should consult with a tax attorney. But as stated previously, if you there is no lien in case it will not be taken from IRS however once in your account they can and will most likely. Good Luck!",
        "If you are asking if the IRS is going to somehow 'intercept' the payment coming from the defendant, no, you've described no tax lien served on the insurer, so the check goes directly from the insurer / administrator to you. BUT ONCE you've got that money in hand, it's just like any other asset. Nothing in the California Labor Code protects workers comp awards from the IRS and it's shenanigans.",
        "I dont think that your question is really a workers compensation question. You likely need to consult with a tax professional asap."

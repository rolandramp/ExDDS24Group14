    "title": "How to properly pay a lump sum to settle with a collection agency on a post judgment?",
    "question": "I recently received a wage garnishment order a month ago which already has been applied to my recent paycheck. Prior to the order, I called the collection agency and tried to settle. The original medical bill was $1,100 a few years back. After interest, court fees, the judgment amout is $2,700.00. I called the company and asked them if they would take $1,800.00 as a lump sum and the guy told me he would speak to his manager. Two days later of being told I would get a call back, I called and spoke to the manager today and spoke with him and offered $1,800.00. He told me he could only offer 15% deduction which is nothing. I told the manager I only have $1,800.00. Any advice on how to approach this matter? Thank you",

        "As other attorneys have already answered, once there is a judgment against you and the times to challenge, set aside or appeal that judgment are passed you do not have much leverage in negotiation. What additional general information I can provide is as follows:\n\n1. If the collection agency requests financial documents prior to agreeing to any settlement amount for you to \"prove\" how you cannot pay more, be wary before you agree. You may just be handing them information on how to garnish your wages or bank accounts. They may legally manage to obtain this information later, but try not to give documents if you can avoid it.\n\n2. As other attorneys have said, get a signed settlement agreement that THEY sign releasing you and demand a formal satisfaction of judgment be filed as well as applicable.\n\n3. When negotiating away a debt, there may be tax consequences if the collection agency \"writes off\" a portion of the debt. Be careful and make sure you discuss this in negotiation and with your tax professional beforehand.\n\n4. If you talk to them on the phone, try and follow up with a memorializing email as some collection agencies tend to get \"phone amnesia\" the second you hang up. Especially when negotiating settlement terms or making an offer, putting it in writing is safer. Insist they also send emails with offers or counter offers or acceptances.\n\n5. The devil is in the details. When making or accepting an offer, be very clear of all terms that you are offering or accepting. Don't just offer to pay, make sure it is clear what they must agree to as well, how you will pay, when you will pay, what releases you will get etc.\n\n6. Finally, so long as you have a potential or pending judgment against you, there are legal limitations on asset protection and how you dispose of or title your assets to avoid creditors. Do not try to unlawfully hide assets from collectors as that may (depending on the specific facts and law) constitute fraudulent conveyance which can in the worst potential cases lead to additional judgments against. Speak to an attorney if you have questions there.\n\nThis is just some general information but I hope it can also assist you in making an informed decision or if you seek further legal advice from an attorney.\n\nGood luck,\nAssly Sayyar, Esq.",
        "There is no reason to negotiate with you. They have a judgment good for ten years which can be renewed. Further, post judgment interest of 10% is accruing and they have a garnishment in place. It will be tough if not possible. You should have settled before the judgment was obtained.",
        "Did you let them take a default judgment against you? For the full amount of their claim? What proof did they produce in court that you owed the money, and how did they justify their computations?\n\nUnless you have a basis to set aside the judgment, file a Claim of Exemption for the wage garnishment. File a Claim of Exemption for every legal process they use. Do not let them know where your bank accounts are. If they get nothing for a while, they might accept something. But, be sure that you have a settlement agreement in writing. Perhaps they should also stipulate to setting aside the judgment so that your credit score will improve.",
        "There are many ways to negotiate\nTypically you should only pay between 30 to 40 percent"

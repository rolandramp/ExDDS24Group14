        "I agree in general with my colleagues. But depending on the source of your income, you may not have to file bankruptcy at all. The only way to find out is to speak to a reputable bankruptcy attorney or you can call the Santa Clara County Bar Association. They have a Modest Means Attorney panel and may have a pro bono panel of attorneys that you may qualify for. Google their phone number if you are interessted.",
        "Attorney Firth is right. Bankruptcy is probably your best option at this point. Remember, BK is more than checking boxes on forms you find online. Find/consult/hire a lawyer using the Avvo feature \"Find a Lawyer\". Make a list of 4-5 having many 5 star reviews from satisfied clients. If you don't get a prompt call back from one, go on to the next on your list. Some offer a free consultation by phone or in person. Good luck & God bless.",
        "You can file chapter 7 bankruptcy once every eight years. It is measured from date of filing, not date of discharge. I suggest you consult with a bankruptcy attorney in your area to review your options. Most attorneys offer a free initial consult.",
        "I agree with my colleagues. It seems like bankruptcy may be a good idea for you and your husband. You can file bankruptcy every 8 years. The 8 years begins from the date your prior bankruptcy was filed, not when it ended. I recommend speaking with a couple experienced bankruptcy attorneys about your financial situation. They will be able to guide you and provide you details regarding your specific situation. I hope this helps."

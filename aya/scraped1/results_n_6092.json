    "title": "Can I strip BOTH my second mortgage AND HOA liens in a BK 13 in California?",
    "question": "I am trying to find the latest rulings on lien and debt stripping in BK 13. The identical condo next door just sold for 139K. My first is 157K, and my second is 155K which i have not paid in 2 years. I did not pay my HOA for 2 years and they placed a lien on my condo for $8K. I entered a repayment agreemnent for the past due HOA and pay $300 monthly plus current HOA dues of. $339. HELP! Is this a good time to file BK13? I have a new job after being unemployed for 2 years. I make 70K per year, half my former salary. I dont want to be saddled with debt again. I also owe $80K on my credit cards which I stopped paying 2 years ago. No one has sued me yet. What is your opinion? Thanks so much, I plan on hiring a lawyer.",

        "You are a very good candidate for consideration for a chapter 13 bankruptcy. If your Condo is comparable to the one next door and would be appraised for less than your first mortgage then you will be able to strip off your second mortgage without much trouble. As for the HOA dues as you will be keeping your condo you will have to pay the arrears in your chapter 13 plan. You attorney will be also able to get this lien removed. Without knowing more about your circumstances it is difficult for one to say whether this is a good time for you to file. I can only suggest that you meet with an attorney to discuss these issues.",
        "Schedule a consultation with an experienced chapter 13 attorney. They can go through the process and the anticipated results with you. Chapter 13 would likely allow you to strip off the second lien. Since I'm not licensed in CA I can't speak to how the HOA lien would be treated in a chapter 13 - that varies state to state."

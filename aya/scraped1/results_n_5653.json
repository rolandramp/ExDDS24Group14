    "answers": [
        "A determination that you have to repay money means that the EDD has determined that you got money you were not entitled to receive, and likely due to what it claims to be some kind of misrepresentation by you or a failure to provide information by you. You will not avoid that liability by proving financial hardship.\n\nYour best bet is to try to negotiate payment over time.\n\nWe all face consequences for our actions. Apparently the EDD has proven that you did something that entitles them to seek the return of money you did not have a right to, and this is now the consequence of your actions.\n\nGood luck to you.",
        "It is unlikely the EDD will forgive the debt because of financial hardship. If the amount owed turns into a judgment, it will seek any debit collection methods it has available to it. Some debts can be discharged through bankruptcy but if the amount you were found to owe was based on a claim of fraud, it is not dischargeable. The best you can hope for is to find a way to make some kind of payment arrangement. I'm sorry I cannot offer any better advice.",

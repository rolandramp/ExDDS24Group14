    "title": "When a California limited liability company is \"FTB Suspended\" does it mean it cannot do business?",
    "question": "Anyone in California able to explain what happens to a limited liability company that is FTB Suspended? Can the owner do business under another entity such as a dba? If the person does not use the entity, can he just leave it FTB Suspended?",
    "answers": [
        "If you do not use the entity, you can leave it suspended, however, you may be liable for back taxes in the event California ever decides to go after them. Since the entity is suspended it cannot do business in California. However, that does not mean you personally are prohibited from doing business. You are only prohibited from doing business in the name of the suspended entity and you are not allowed to avail yourself of the entity protections, ie you are personally liable for business debts and liabilities.",
        "A suspended LLC loses its \"powers, rights and privileges\".\n\nAs is described in the post at the link below, suspension is a serious, risky development.\n\nHowever, as a practical matter, a suspended entity is not precluded from conducting business. Consider, for example, that at this moment, countless entities have been suspended without their owners' knowledge - and many of those entities continue to operate their businesses, despite suspension.",
        "Yes, this means the LLC cannot legally do business.\n\nAlso, if you do not plan on using the LLC ever again, yes, you can leave it FTB suspended.",
        "An FTB suspension usually means the limited liability company has failed to pay its annual minimum tax. It can also mean the LLC failed to file its binnenial statement with the California Secretary of State. LLC's with a suspended charter are prohibited by law from conducting business. Those LLC's that conduct business anyway run the risk of having any contracts entered into while suspended voided at the option of the other party. Moreover, an LLC cannot bring or defend a lawsuit while its charter is suspended. The procedure for lifting a suspension is called a revivor. Mostly it involves filing the tax returns and paying the back taxes, penalties, and interest, and filing its biennial Statement.\n\nIf an LLC fails to revive its charter after a few years, its charter is revoked and cannot be revived. Sometimes it may make more economic sense to abandon a suspended LLC rather than bring it current and use the funds that would have been used to pay back taxes to form a new entity. You should consult with a tax lawyer or CPA to determine the best course of action for your situation."

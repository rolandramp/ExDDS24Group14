    "question": "The federal rules of bankruptcy procedure, specifically rule 4004(a) makes it seem as though the 60 days deadline to file an adversary proceeding only applies to objections under 727(a)(8) or (a)(9). Can I still file an action to object under 727(a)(4) if the 60 days deadline after the 341(a) hearing has passed?",
    "answers": [
        "If you are an individual creditor with a personal debt you want the debtor to repay, you really don't want to file a 727 adversary complaint (which prevents all his debts from being discharged). You want to file a 523 adversary proceeding (which only exempts YOUR debt, but allows the rest of the debts to be discharged, so the debtor has a better ability to pay your debt off). Bankruptcy Rule 4007 governs the time for filing an adversary complaint under 523 and not all subsections require that the complaint be filed within 60 days of the initial 341 meeting. You really should consult with an experienced bankruptcy attorney, both as to grounds and timing of such a complaint.",

        "Also check the docket to see if there has been a stipulation to extend the deadline as that it quite common as well.",
        "There is a deadline - see Rule 4004.",
        "An action under 727(a)4 must be brought within the 60 day period following the 341a meeting (unless an extension is sought before the 60 days are up). Under 727(d) a creditor or the trustee or the US Trustee under limited circumstances can request revocation of a discharge for one year after the case is discharged or closed whichever is later.",
        "A 727 action can be brought within 1 year of the discharge date so it is not too late."

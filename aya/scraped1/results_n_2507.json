        "Generally liens ride through Chapter 7 bankruptcy. That means that all liens that existed before you filed will still exist after you file unless you take steps within the bankruptcy to remove them. Judgment liens can be removed or \"striped\" from property within the Chapter 7 bankruptcy. This process is called a 522(f) motion and there are several detailed requirements in order to successfully strip a lien. You should talk with the attorney that represented you to discuss this option. If you did not have an attorney you should speak with one to reopen your case and attempt to strip the lien. The lienholder can enforce his pre-petition lien rights against the property, however he cannot try to hold you personally liable for the debt as that would be a violation of the discharge injunction.",
        "You may have discharged the judgment in your Chapter 7 case, but the recorded lien survives your discharge. Did you file the Chapter 7 case yourself? Or did you retain an attorney to file the case for you? A motion to avoid the judicial lien should have been filed in the bankruptcy court, and an order avoiding the lien should have been prepared for the bankruptcy judge to execute. If that process is not done, the judicial lien survives your discharge. You will need to file a motion to reopen your Chapter 7 case if you want to file a motion to avoid the lien at this stage of the game. Go consult a local bankruptcy attorney.",
        "Yes, and you either have to file a motion with the court to void the lien or pay the lienholder some minimal amount to terminate the lien. Some times they do it for free if your bk attorney requests it,",
        "An abstract attaches to all real property located in the county where it was recorded. If you had no real property, it did not attach to anything. If you had real property when the abstract was recorded, the lien stays attached until it is removed. It can be removed in bankruptcy if it \"impairs an exemption.\" A motion is required. The DEBT is discharged (unless it is a non-dischargeable debt). Therefore the lien created by the abstract cannot attach to after-acquired post-petition real property because there is no longer a debt.",
        "If your discharge included the judgment, it would not attach to nearly acquire property after discharge.",
        "If your case is still open, you can file a motion to avoid the lien under certain circumstances. if the case is closed, you can ask the Court to reopen it and then file your motion to avoid lien. You will need to pay a reopening fee if the case is closed and you need to reopen it ($260).",
        "This would be a lien against any real property owned in the county where the judgment was recorded. There is a way to \"avoid\" this lien in bankruptcy in some situations.

        "Your question is not entirely clear. If the abstract judgment was recorded as a lien on your real property PRIOR to you filing bankruptcy then your attorney would have had to file a \"Motion to Avoid Lien\" in order to get the lien off the property (assuming your property does not have any equity for it to attach onto). If the abstract judgment was not recorded PRIOR to you filing bankruptcy then the creditor cannot record it AFTER you filed. The debt would not longer exist and would be considered discharged. If your situation is the former then you can reopen your case to file the motion to avoid lien, if necessary. Hope this helps!",

        "In California, the ability to \"go after\" a non-debtor spouse's earnings and assets to satisfy a judgment is based on the concept of community property. Spouses cease having community property upon legal separation or divorce (depends on facts.)\n\nIn other words, once you have a judgment, THEN you consider whether there are community assets in the hands of the non-debtor spouse that could be used to satisfy a judgment against the debtor spouse. If the spouses were already divorced at the time the judgment was issued, it is unlikely you can go after non-debtor former spouse's wages for payment of the judgment.\n\nBut, a few details could affect your situation: did your lawsuit allege fraud? Did the non-debtor spouse participate in the fraud? Do you have reason to believe community assets were divided (in the divorce) with the intent to defraud or frustrate debtor spouse's creditors? Were you granted a pre-trial lien or attachment on any assets before judgment was rendered in the case?",
        "California is a community property state and if the debt was incurred for the benefit of the community then both husband and wife are liable for the debt. The husband's bankruptcy discharge does not preclude you from going after the wife. The debt seems to have been obtained during the marriage and so long as the community benefited then you may have a claim against the wife but you would have to sue and obtain a judgment against her provided the lawsuit is not precluded by the statue of limitations.",
        "Yes. If ex- W participated in the fraud you may proceed against her.\nBe advised that a debt as result of fraud is not discharged in BK.\nConsult BK counsel regarding collection from both spouses.",
        "If you received a judgment against him only, then the ex wife is not liable on the debt. Have a local attorney review the judgement for you.",
        "I can tell you that his discharge of the debt owed to you or your company in the judgment debtor's bankruptcy case did not discharge any obligation of the judgment debtor's ex-wife. However, the next part of your question should be answered by a California attorney that understands the other issues raised by your question.\n\nI have added some tags to try to get the question before attorneys that could answer that question."

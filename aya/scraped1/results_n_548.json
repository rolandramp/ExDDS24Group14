    "question": "I bought a piece of land in San Diego county, in 2014. I later came to find that the boundaries were not as described due to the age of the survey records, Additionally the seller fenced off my access. I tried mediation but it didnt work, i took them to court and sadly lost. I had to take money from my retirement accounts to pay my lawyers, and i still owe them money $40K. This year I cannot write off my legal fees, and now I owe the IRS $90K. I have $15K in credit card debt. I own land that I can't access. I am currently on State disability because I have Lyme disease and Rheumatoid Arthritis. I have abour $6K in retirement account, and still owe about $4K on my 2014 Subaru. I feel suicidal. What can I do? Would bankruptcy help me? what type?",

        "I agree with attorney Rode. It is only money and not worth killing yourself over. Things are not nearly as bad as you think. I suggest that you take advantage of a free consult with a bankruptcy attorney. Depending on the facts, the IRS debt may be dischargeable and in your situation, they will work out a minimal payment plan, As for the rest, you may very well be judgment proof.",
        "First, your statement that you feel suicidal is concerning. Please call emergency personnel or your doctor right away.\nBankruptcy might be a good option for you. I am sorry to hear that you lost your lawsuit. The attorney fees can be discharged in a bankruptcy. Tax debt incurred within the last 3 years cannot be discharge but you should be able to establish a payment plan with the IRS or you can consider a chapter 13 bankruptcy which would give you a payment plan for your tax debt. the credit card debt is dischargeable and you may have some helpful options regarding your Subaru. I highly recommend calling a couple of experienced bankruptcy attorneys and speaking to them about your financial situation. I hope this helps.",
        "You really need to go over all the particulars with a Local San Diego Bankruptcy attorney. The judgment will need to be reviewed as well as what the fair market value of the property is. There is also some good tax options that may be available to you as well."

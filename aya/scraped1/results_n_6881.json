    "question": "After battling through my CH 7 BK to be granted relief of stay, I just ran title with a friend at a title company and bank recorded Notice of Rescission of NOD 5 days ago. Why would they do this? Does that mean NOD process will need to start all over again? Any other insights?",

        "We'd all be speculating as to why the bank rescinded the Notice of Default. It is possible that the bank failed to contact you to explore options to foreclosure prior to recording a Notice of Default, in violation of California Civil code § 2923.5.\n\nUnder the Perata Mortgage Relief Act (Civil Code § 2923.5 et seq.), applicable to loans secured by owner-occupied residential real property containing no more than four dwelling units and recorded from January 1, 2003 to December 31, 2007, lenders may not file a notice of default until 30 days after (i) initial contact with the borrower; or (ii) satisfying statutorily-mandated “due diligence” requirements for contacting the borrower. See:\n\nhttps://www.avvo.com/legal-guides/ugc/compliance-with-the-perata-mortgage-relief-act-in-california?ref=kb_serp_title_2\n\nThe good news, however, is the the bank would have to start all over again.",
        "It sounds like the bank did something wrong and will need to start over from scratch. This is probably a good thing for you, as it gives you more time.",
        "Your guess is as good as anything I can come up with. Lenders in general seem to be all over the board. There seem to be so much confusion that things change from one day to the next. Even the bankruptcy court have gotten fed up with the situation. Now anyone holding the note on a home mortgage is subject to a complete new set of rules as to what they are required to do when they file a ciiam. A number of big banks have been sanctioned by bankruptcy court for a series of what seems to be intentional mistakes ranging from Corpus Christi, Lousiana to Pen. I would be very careful. Hire a lawyer and let him get to the bottom of what is going on. I am not trying to run down banks or mortgage companies but the situation has really gotten out of hand."

    "title": "Can an attorney who specializes in student loans help me with wage garnishment for a defaulted loan?",
    "question": "My loan has been sent to collections, and my wages are being garnished. I cant afford to pay it in full, the agency has given me a deadline of Dec. 10th 2018 to file for loan forgiveness - hardship. Ive contacted programs from the internet to help me, but further research I find their practices are fraudulent. I need answers and some legitimate help. Is the collections agency trustworthy to help with the situation.",

        "Go to the website of the National Association of Consumer Advocates and check out the attorneys listed there. The NACA is a membership organization dedicated to helping consumers. Beware of companies which try to consolidate your loans or put you on a payment program. The problem with the payment programs offered are that interest continues to accrue and the companiy's fees are added to the balance of the loan. At the end of the program, the balance is more than the amount originally owned.",
        "Be very cautious (suspicious) about any company that you find on the internet that promises to help you resolve defaulted student loans. Many such companies are scams which take your money but do nothing to help with the underlying problem. There are a few attorneys with expertise in student loan issues, and if you are totally lost that may be your best option, but there's a lot you can do on your own to understand how you got here and what you might be able to do to avoid or reduce the wage garnishment.\n\nFirst, run a credit report to review all of your loans, federal and private. If you have FEDERAL loans, visit the National Student Loan Data System to register and log on to view your federal loans. Find out from the loan servicer or debt collection agency if you have any options other than a hardship application. For example, can you CONSOLIDATE your federal loans and start over with a new loan? If you have not yet been through REHABILITATION, can you apply for rehabilitation? Note that if you have already done either of these things, these options won't be available.\n\nIf you were sued by a private lender, and if the lender got a judgment which is now being executed through a wage garnishment, discuss that judgment with a debt collection defense attorney.",
        "Contact the Student loan company directly and see if they have any hardship programs or see if you qualify for an income based payment plan. Collection agency will do what is in their best interest, not yours. Find an attorney that has experience in student loan workouts."

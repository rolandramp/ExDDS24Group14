    "title": "Can an overpayment of use of food stamps be added to chapter 7 filing?",
    "question": "Last year I had food stamps, but I was over issued, which now results in paying back some of the money. Can the overpayment of $1,000 be added to chapter 7",
    "answers": [
        "You must list the overpayment as a debt and add it to the Chapter 7. Whether it is dischargeable depends on facts that you have not given us.",
        "I concur with my colleagues. You can list the overpayment as a debt.",
        "Yes, all debts must be disclosed including overpayment of food stamps. Whether or not such a debt is dischargeable is not known from the limited information you included. If there was any fraud on your part in obtaining the overpayment, the State may challenge the discharge. If you have already filed, and omitted the food stamp debt, you will need to amend your schedules accordingly. If you do not know how to do that, get an appt with a BK lawyer in your area. Some of us offer a free consultation by phone or in person. Take us up on it. BK is not a DIY project.",

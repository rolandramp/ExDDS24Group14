    "title": "If a Creditor cannot validate a debt may they list the Debt on your Credit Report?",
    "question": "If a creditor (Collection Agency) reports unvalidated Debt to the Credit Bureaus and it appears on your Credit Report is this considered a Violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA)? I am being sued by a Collection Agency and the Collection Agency has done just that. May I sue them for $1000 in damages for this Violation and list this Violation as an Affirmative Defense on my Form Answer to the Summons? And must I fill out another Form to Counter-Claim this when I turn in my Answer? If so, which one?",

        "First, I apologize for being nitpicky but a creditor is not a collection agency. A creditor is the entity or person that originally granted you the credit and a collection agency is usually a third party organization that purchases from the creditor the right to try and collect on a series of overdue accounts. So, are you being sued by a creditor or debt collector?\n\nA debt collector is allowed to report unvalidated debt on your credit report. However, if they sued you and they are unable to produce the necessary documents or witnesses to link you to the account then they would ultimately lose the law suit. At this point they would be required to remove the account from your credit report. I highly recommend that you DO NOT attempt to litigate this on your own. Contact a debt collection attorney and to put yourself in a better position.\n\nThe information provided above assumes that you at some point utilized the credit account that forms the basis of the debt collector's law suit. If you don't think the account is yours, then you may be able to challenge the credit reporting right now. You may also be able to bring a counter suit against the debt collector but again you need to contact an attorney to find out what your rights are. Most attorney's that practice debt collection defense or consumer protection charge nothing for an initial consultation so you really have nothing to lose.\n\nI wish you the best in this situation.",
        "Yes. Creditor may list the debt. However, you amy demand validation. If creditor cannot validate, you should explain to credit reporting agency, and creditor the lack of validation and demand debt be removed from credit report. If no action taken, you can sue under FDCPA and California Unruh Act for violation and damages."

    "title": "I am in chapter 13 and am in the process of making my monthly payments etc.to the trustee? Do I have to declare a gift?",
    "question": "My plan has not yet been approved, but I already had the meeting of creditors. My parents gave me an $800 dollar gift to help me out financially and also as a birthday gift. I have been holding it since march and have been going back and forth as to whether or not to give it back to them. If I keep it and deposit it in savings, will it mess up my bankruptcy and do I have to notify the court. It is not a loan, it was a gift. Please advise.",

        "Post-petition assets are property of the bankruptcy estate in ch. 13, generally.\n\nMany districts, like mine, are very strict about disclosure of post-petition assets. The issue involves disclosure and then exemption of the disclosed asset.\n\nWhether you're able to exempt the asset will, largely, determine the effect of has on your case.",
        "To add to what my colleagues have advised: To start, if you are represented by an attorney, this is a question that should be asked to him/her. If you are not represented by an attorney, it is highly encouraged that you consult and retain one as successfully navigating a Chapter 13 is extremely difficult. In saying that, if you had this money pre-petition (prior to the filing date of your case), then it should be in your Schedule B and scheduled as an asset of your bankruptcy estate. If you received this money after the filing date of your case, it is a post-petition asset but you may still need to amend your Schedules and list it as an asset. The Chapter 13 Trustee may be open to discussing how to treat this money. Also, as it is not a large sum, it shouldn't make or break whether you can confirm a Plan or not. It is generally best to be open and upfront with the Chapter 13 Trustee as they may provide some guidance as to how your Chapter 13 Plan can be confirmed.",
        "If you had the check in your possession before you filed your bankruptcy case, you should have disclosed it as an asset of \"cash\" in your schedules. If this is not an ongoing contribution you will be receiving to assist you financially, I don't think you have any issues. I urge you to seek specific advice from an experienced chapter 13 bankruptcy attorney in your area.",
        "I agree with some of the answers above, but it does depend on the size of the gift.",

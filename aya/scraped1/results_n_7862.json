    "title": "Who can I list as witnesses in my divorce case?",
    "question": "I am preparing a list of witnesses for my divorce trial. Who can I call as witnesses? Do I have to subpoena them? What if I list a witness and he doesn't show up?",
    "answers": [
        "I have answered this already. Preparing a list is fine but you need a subpoena to be served on the witness to have legal authority to compel attendance. Hoping they will show up is insufficient. If you do subpoena them and they don't show up then the Court will issue a contempt order or OSC. You can call anyone who has legitimate valuable information needed to prove your case. Again, if you do not intend to call them to the stand after all, tell them ASAP to save them the effort of coming to court.",
        "The other attorney is correct. You can call anyone with relevant information . However, you must subpoena them to testify at trial. Just listing them on your witness list is insufficient. If a subpoenaed witness fails to appear for trial, the court can issue a bench warrant.",
        "You can call anyone with relevant information on assets, debts, income, expenses, community property, separate property, premarital or postnuptial agreements -- anything related to the parties' financial and living conditions.\n\nYes, you can subpoena them. If a subpoenaed witness can't make it, you can request that the trial be rescheduled due to their unavailability. The Court will then determine the importance of the witness, the validity of the subpoena, and whether the case can proceed without them. -- http://richarddwyer.com"

I am forced to pay most of the mortgage, bills and food because he refuses to pay. He also threatened that if I don't pay most of it, he's going not going to allow me to have the daycare in our home. Can he stop my business?(he's also a police officer) I also paid $500 a month for 2 1/2 for his motorcycle that's only on his name, do I get something for paying? He bought a car only in his name last year and over $14,000 is owed Am I responsible for that car??",

        "You need to get to an attorney immediately. You need to be able to answer the question about whether your mother's estate is in probate or there have been orders out of probate. The question about what your rights are is not simple and you most assuredly need an attorney. It would have been a good idea for you and your mother to have consulted with an attorney before she put your husband's name on the deed but I suspect there is some reason why that was done -- I would guess someone was refinancing and your credit was bad or something like that. Be able to tell the attorney you consult why the title to the house is as it is because it is important and your mother is not available to answer that question. The two of you are still married so you are continuing to acquire property and debts no matter whose name the title may be in and you are continuing to accrue debts for which you may both be responsible -- actually each of you is responsible and how the responsibility for payment of the debt will not prejudice the rights of your creditor to collect from whichever of you they want. A debt that is secured by an asset -- the car is a good example -- will go with the car. If the car is awarded to him he will be responsible for the debt and the value of the car will be whatever its net worth may be. If the motorcycle is awarded to him and the debt has been paid off he will owe you for half of the value. The fact that he is a police officer does not have any bearing on your rights -- except that you have an interest in his pension, deferred compensation and the value of accumulated vacation, sick and comp time. It also means you will be able to collect on any order for support or equalizing payment the court may make. You need to see a lawyer before you file this yourself and make a mess of it.",
        "This is indeed messy from the start. You say your mother named you as your heir: is that still in probate? Are you tenants in common with hubby? or is that Mom who is shown as t/c?

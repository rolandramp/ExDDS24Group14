    "title": "Filed BK7 pro se: How long do I have to surrender my car after my 341 hearing?",
    "question": "My 341 hearing was a week ago Wednesday (07/22); however, it was rescheduled after my first meeting (on 06/23) because I needed to file a few amendments. I thought, initially, that I would reaffirm the loan - which is what I indicated on my statement of intention - but now I'm thinking I want to surrender it due to nearly 50% negative equity in it, among other things.",
    "answers": [
        "The statement of intentions is just that intentions. You can change your mind and the debt will be discharged in the bankruptcy.\nThe Code provides that you have 30 days from your creditor meeting to begin performing on your statement of intentions, so you have 30 days to contact the creditor to make arrangements to have them pick up the car.\nIt may take substantially longer for them to do so.\nAlso, the surrender of the car is a voluntary repo, but any deficiency from that sale of car will be discharged, and your credit report should reflect the debt was included in your bankruptcy.",
        "Even if you do not amend your Statement of Intentions (from Reaffirm to Surrender), the vehicle loan is still considered to be part of your bankruptcy and with be discharged (erased) along with your other debts if you do not sign a reaffirmation agreement.\nThis is regardless of whether the creditor takes the vehicle through your voluntary surrender or through a repossession.\nHow long you get to hold on to the vehicle is different from creditor to creditor.\nThe friendliest way for all involved is to call up the creditor and let them know that you want to surrender the vehicle and you will then arrange a time for pickup or they will ask you to take it down to a local dealer.\nIf you wait for repossession, I would, at minimum, advice that you keep your car clear of all personal items because it will be very difficult to get them back after the car is taken.",
        "You have 30 days from the 341(a) hearing to perform your stated intention regarding secured consumer debts secured by personal property. See Bankruptcy Code section 521(a)(2)(B). After 30 days from the 341(a) hearing the automatic stay expired. See section 362(h). If the stay expires the secured creditor can repossess your vehicle which is an involuntary repossession.",
        "Amend you petition to indicate that you are surrendering the car. You can call the car lender to tell them you are surrendering the car or wait for them to call you and or pick it up. Don't leave anything of value on the car. I've known some car lender to pick up the car without warning.",
        "If you do nothing, usually the creditor either six relief from stay or wait for the case to close to repossess the vehicle.\n\nHow it shows up on your credit report, I do not know.\nYou can drive the vehicle until the creditor repossesses it or if you so desire you can contact it.\n\nIt probably May not accept the vehicle until after ithas relief for the case is closed\n\n\nWhat are you doing about a replacement car?",
        "How long you have to surrender the vehicle is really a decision for the creditor to make. Hope this perspective helps!"

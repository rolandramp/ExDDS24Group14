    "title": "Can I keep one credit card if I have no debt on it when I file bankruptsy",
    "question": "I have a chronic disease that prevents me from working. Due to this disease I have lost my job of $150K per year, am not eligible for unemployment because I cannot work 40 hours a week, am in the long process of trying to get SSDI (application denied and I have submitted an appeal. I understand only 10% of first appeals are approved. Success usually found on appeal before a judge). My salary was 3 times my wife's, so after 3 years have used savings and maxed out most credit cards. I want to take advantage of the Keep Your Home program, but my wife has decided she does not want to be married to someone who is disabled. So she had decide to file for bankruptcy (which makes us ineligible for Keep Your Home). SO - I have a credit card from the Federal credit union that is associated with my former employer. It has a small amount of debt on it, but I am getting money back from taxes because my severance pay was taxed at highest rate. So I am wondering if I pay that off before my wife and I file bankruptcy if I can keep that credit card. I guess a second question is there any way for me to not file bankruptcy if my wife does?",

        "Keeping the credit card as an active and open account will not depend on your circumstances or situation, but will depend on whether that company wishes to offer you credit in the future. If an account is paid in full at the time of the filing, they are NOT a creditor and I would not list them as a creditor. However, they will still find out about the filing through the credit reporting process. It will be at their discretion as to whether they will keep the account open. Almost all companies will deny future credit and close the account.\n\nDiscuss this with the attorney that will represent you in the case. They might be able to tell you which creditors are more likely to keep an account open that had a zero balance as of the filing.",
        "Yes. You may wish not to file joint BK with W. Either spouse may file individual BK.\nYou need to consult BK counsel individually. May/not be in interest to join in BK filing with W.

        "I am sorry to hear of your circumstances, but I concur with my colleagues Berkus and Needleman that your continued use of a credit card after filing a bankruptcy will likely terminate once the issuer learns of the filing.

Some offer a free consultation by phone or in person. Remember, bankruptcy is not a DIY project. Good luck to you.",
        "First if the card has a zero balance and you did not pay more than $600 to that card prior to filing, the card would not need to be listed on your schedules. From your question, I do not know what the balance is that you are paying off. If you pay more than the $600 in the 3 months prior to fiing, the payment could be a preference payment, meaning you chose to pay the Creidt Union instead of your other debts. The Bankruptcy Trustee could bring an action to recover the funds you paid, hence you would most certainly lose your credit card, In addition, Credit Unions typically will discover your bankruptcy fiing in the ordinary course of their business and choose to revoke your card. Do you really want to gamble with your money and pay what appears to be a dischargeable debt and then potentially have your charge card cancelled?",
        "It won't be up to you. If the card has a zero balance, you do not need to list it on your bankruptcy sxhedules. However, the lender will still find out about the bankruptcy; 9 times out of 10, the lender will close the card."

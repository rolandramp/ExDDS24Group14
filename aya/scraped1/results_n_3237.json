    "title": "Balance on Hand at end of Bankruptcy?",
    "question": "I have 2 months left on my Chapter 13 plan. My monthly payment is $3500 a month. The Trustee currently pays $2200/month to our mortgage company and the rest of the amount goes into the \"balance on hand\" account which has now accumulated over $12,000 over the course of these last year. All other debts have a $0 balance which is why this money is going into the balance on hand account. What will happen to that money after we have made our last two payments? Is it possible we will receive that money at the end of the term? Can they use that balance to make the last two payments?",

        "You should hire another lawyer to help you complete your case. Under BAPCPA even at this stage things can go wrong. You shouldn't have to keep paying if your case is paid off. Of course, every jurisdiction is a little bit different. If your first attorney forces you to hire another attorney to finish your case, you should seek disgorgement of fees for being abandoned.",
        "Congratulations! Looks like you should be getting a check. Sometimes, creditors do not file claims in Chapter 13 cases and therefore, do not get paid, even though your Plan provided for them. In such cases, you will \"overpay\" the Plan and may receive the surplus. Double congrats if you completed your 13 without a lawyer! That is almost unheard of. Good luck to you.",
        "I don't know how any attorney could honestly and fully answer your question w/o knowing your plan terms and the facts of your case ! Simple as that. The plan is a contract. which governs the terms of your case! So NO attorney can possibly answer correctly w/o knowing the terms of your confirmed plan and the allowed claims and facts of your case. As a result, obtain and employ a new experienced ch 13 attorney to advise you not only on your rights, but your options. Sincerely, Richard",
        "You or your attorney needs to ask the TTee if you need to make any more payments, but it seems to me that if all your other debts have been paid, and the TTee has enough on hand to make the last two mortgage and arrearage payments, that you should not have to make any more payments. You will likely need to file a certification regarding Domestic Support Obligations and Prior Discharges and you need to make sure your Financial Management Course Certificate has been filed with the court. Congratulations on completing your Ch13.",
        "You can check with the Chapter 13 Trustee to see if you are paid in full and whether he can apply those funds to help close your case out quicker."

        "I agree. I would recommend waiting until after you get your discharge and check around for local dealers that have a \"bankruptcy program\". They will usually be able to put you into a car at a much better rate than the typical 24% from a \"722\" lender.",

While I understand you want to wrap up a deal now, once you get your discharge, plenty of lenders will be happy to finance you for any vehicle of the thousands available for sale on the lots in your community. If the deadlines have elapsed and you still haven't received your discharge, try calling the clerk's office to see if they will expedite your discharge. Hope this perspective helps!"

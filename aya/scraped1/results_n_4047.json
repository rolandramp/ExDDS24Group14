    "title": "How do I stop or reduce the wage garnishment from EDD ?",
    "question": "I am in California. EDD has been chasing me with a debt that my LLC company (not me, but I am the managing member of the LLC ) incurred before it went down. Just last week, my boss came to me with a letter from EDD requesting my employer to withhold 25% of my dispensable income. In EDD's letter, it showed that I owe $61,000 for not paying some taxes. My understanding is, I am partially responsible for my LLC, but I should not 100% responsible for the debt. I would like to know how I can go back to EDD and argue with them about the amount ?",
    "answers": [
        "You should check with a local attorney or the attorney that formed the LLC for you. Good luck.",
        "You do not say when you incurred this debt, but you may be able to discharge all or some it the debt in a bankruptcy. At the very least you can control this creditor. Call an attorney right away.",
        "It may be too late to litigate this matter, but with the size of this debt, you may want to talk to an attorney about a Chapter 13 Bankruptcy case to minimize your liability. Hope this perspective helps!"

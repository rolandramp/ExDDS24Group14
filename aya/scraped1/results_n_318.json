    "question": "I filed appeal and lost it. The court awarded that I had to bear the costs of the appellee. Can I file bankruptcy to wipe out the judgment?",
    "answers": [
        "Above responses from colleagues are correct. You’ll need an attorney to review the judgment /claim to get a legal opinion regarding whether this debt is dischargeable. If so, bankruptcy would be one option. Negotiated settlement in lieu of bankruptcy may be another option.",
        "More information is needed to give you useful advice. As stated by my colleague, if the underlying debt is one of the so-called \"bankruptcy crimes\" set forth at 11 USC 523, the costs/atty fees associated with losing an appeal are probably not dischargeable.",
        "That depends on the underlying judgment. You need to consult bankruptcy counsel. Motion work in the trial court is something you will want to consider, first."

    "title": "Chapter 7 means test. Will a leased car help the same as a financed car would help to get me qualified? ownership expense, etc.?",
    "question": "Just wondering if a leased car works the same as a financed car on the means test. Also, how should it be reported on schedules since really the bank owns the car?",
    "answers": [
        "Leased car payments are treated the same on the means test as a vehicle that is being bought. Though this only an issue if you are above the median income. On schedules, I generally list a lease on Schedule G only as it is not something that you own which you would otherwise list on Schedule B.",
        "Yes. If you intend to retain the leased vehicle, list same as financed vehicle.\nVehicle listed elsewhere on BK schedules as follows:\n-Schedule B with a note stating it is leased vehicle;\n-Schedule G as a lease;\n-Schedule J as monthly expense if you retain the vehicle.\nYou may state intent to surrender the vehicle and so indicate on respective Schedules.",
        "The car is listed on the schedule B with a note that it is leased. you also list it on Schedule G as a lease and on Schedule J as a monthly expense, assuming you ant tot keep the car.",
        "A leased vehicle will be treated the same as a financed vehicle on the means test. However, if you under median income, you will not need to complete the means test to include this expense. If you are above median and must therefore complete the means test, you should be getting an experienced attorney to rebut who to help you rebut the presumption of abuse."

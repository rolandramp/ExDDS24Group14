    "answers": [
        "A non-profit organization can be sued. You may or may not be able to pursue a claim against the directors and officers. If they serve without compensation, they may not be sued for negligence as long as they act in good faith in a manner they believe to be in the best interest of the corporation. You may still bring an action for negligence against such officers and directors if they use corporate funds to pay private debts or if they fail to observe corporate formalities. Also, you can sue any officer or director of a non-profit, even if they are not compensated, for their intentional acts and/or fraud.",
        "501(c)(3) status is a tax exemption status not an entity type. A business entity (whether non-profit or tax exempt) can be sued. Directors of the corporation can be made a party to a lawsuit. Either your charter or bylaws (preferably both) should provide for director and officer indemnification. Moreover, you should always have director and officer insurance (D&O) and other appropriate commercial insurances depending on the nature of the business.",
        "As a general rule non-profit entities and/or their directors may be sued. Whether either or both may have liability depends upon your facts. For example, also a general rule, any individual committing a tort may be individually liable for the tort, including directors. If the tort was within the scope of business for the entity, the other directors, generally pursuant to the bylaws, may vote to indemnify the tortfeasor director and then your recourse might be only against the entity itself for all practical purposes. If the issue is more of breach of contract type issue, then the director likely would not be individually liable, assuming the director did not sign a personal guarantee. I doubt this applies to you, as you seem to be a third party to the entity, but breaches of a director's fiduciary duty of care to the entity are typically eligible for indemnification; whereas, breaches of a director's fiduciary duty of loyalty to the entity are not usually eligible for indemnification.",
        "Yes 501 (c) (3) corporations can be sued and individual directors may or may not share liability. It depends on exactly what occurred and how the director was involved. You should contact an attorney who litigates the type of cases that you might have to discuss your options.",
        "Yes, you can sue a not for profit. Depending on the indemnification provisions of directors, and depending on whether corporate formalities have been observed, you sole recourse may be against the corporation, not the individual."

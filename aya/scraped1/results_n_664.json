    "title": "Crushing student loan debt...$216k. I can’t afford to pay it and keep my home. What can I do?",
    "question": "I went through a bitter divorce and custody battle in which I was forced to default on my student loans or be homeless and lose my son. I recently rehabilitated my loans with a ‘pay what you can afford’ type of program and the collection agengcy said that type of program could potentially continue. I completed the program and my loans are now in good standing, plus tens of thousands in collection fees and now a payment I cannot afford, again. Please help!",
    "answers": [
        "Your options depend on whether the loan are federal or private, This is for federal: https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/repay-loans/forgiveness-cancellation\n\nFor information on private loans look here: https://www.studentdebtrelief.us/",
        "Check with the student loan servicer regarding additional payment plans.\nIn the legal context, your only apparent option is chapter 13 as my colleague stated.",
        "You can apply for INCOME-BASED REPAYMENT which is also known as INCOME-CONTINGENT REPAYMENT; that application is submitted to the current loan servicer. If you are qualified you will be given a payment that is based on your income, not based on the amount owed on the debt. It can become difficult or even impossible to pay the loans off in such a program, but at least you will not default, and your wages will be safe. If you are not qualified because your income is too high, seek out the advice of a student loan attorney.",
        "A chapter 13 bankruptcy might be ideal for you, atleast for the next five years. I would immediately contact a local chapter 13 attorney to discuss your options and the ramifications of such a plan for you."

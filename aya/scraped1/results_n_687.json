    "title": "Can a court judge assess a fee for the use of a public defender without knowledge of the defendant's finances?",
    "question": "At sentencing, for a misdemeanor charge, the court fines amounted to $250.00, however, without knowledge of my finances. the presiding Judge added a fee of $250.00 for my use of the Public Defender's Office. My sole income is from Social Security Disability Insurance. I do not qualify for State Supplemental Disability Insurance or Medi-Cal, and I pay the full premium for Medicare coverage. In that Medicare pays 80% of an insured's medical costs, I have accumulated substantial medical debt for the treatment of my disability. The doubling of my fine is a hardship that I can prove if given the opportunity.",

        "Feel free to return to court to ask for a reduction. $250 is very litttle money for an attorney's services.",

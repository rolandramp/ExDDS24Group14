    "title": "Do I need to pay outstanding bills after my aunt passed away?",
    "question": "My aunt passed away in October 2014. I was the only relative (nephew) she had in the USA (my sister lives overseas, she is not a US citizen or resident). My aunt did not leave any will. I did not go to probate court (I was not notified either), I did nothing. My aunt did not have any real property estate and her bank accounts at the time of her death and her personal property (furniture, etc.) were worth a small amount (less than $10.000). There was no probate proceeding. I received a bill statement from a CPA company to pay outstanding bill for senior services (bookkeeping services) over $2,000. It was sent to my address with c/o my name. My sister and I received some money from her life insur. and Thrift Savings Plan as beneficiaries. Am I responsible for this bill or other of her debts?",
    "answers": [
        "Hello,\n\nNeither you or your sister are responsible for your aunt's debts. Her estate is responsible.\n\nSince she died without a Will, she died intestate and the intestacy statutes of CA will determine how her remaining assets are to be distributed. The life insurance and retirement plans are different because it is a contractual relationship and beneficiaries were named.\n\nIf you want to administer her estate, then you would file a small estate affidavit. Please note that you do not have to do so.\n\nJust let these creditors know that you are not administering her estate.",
        "Most likely you are not personally responsible for her debts, unless you provided a personal guarantee. The debts would need to be paid out of the assets of the estate. Since it sounds like there are none, the creditor may be out of luck. Usually nonprobate assets such as insurance proceeds with beneficiary designations are not included. Speak with a local probate attorney to make sure there is nothing you need to do. Many offer free consultations. Good luck to you.",
        "RE: The assets that were solely in your aunt's name.\n\nThe assets that are solely in your aunt's name can be obtained using a small estate affidavit. If you were to use this method, your aunt's outstanding bills should be paid from her bank accounts.\n\nI routinely use a small estate affidavit to obtain small bank accounts. However, sometimes, very small accounts are abandoned because the costs of the small estate affidavit is more than what is in the account.",
        "No. You and sister not responsible for aunt's bills."

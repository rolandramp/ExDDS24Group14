    "title": "Transferring a small claims case to a different state in order to collect judgement by bank levy",
    "question": "Hello. I am a creditor in a small claims judgement in California against a person who is in Boston, MA. Trying to levy on his bank account. His bank is in Boston, but bank's levy dept. is in New Jersey. To collect judgement in any way, I need to have a writ of execution. California doesnt issue such writ for out of state, lacking jurisdiction. So my understanding is that I need to transfer (convert) a case to that specific jurisdiction, and then proceed with Writ issuance. Question: Debtor is in Boston, his bank's levy dept is in NJ, Where do I transfer the case to, MA or NJ? and How (at least in general terms) is this done please? Thank you very much!",

        "I have always said you can get a lot of exercise by jumping to conclusions and the facts you have mentioned which you believe are pertinent are irrelevant. Only issue is \"does this bank have a branch in California?\" If so, then the levy is on an in-state bank. Where the bank maintains its headquarters is unimportant. Hope this perspective helps!",
        "You didn't mention which bank it is.\n\nThe \"levy department\" may be in New Jersey but if the bank does business in California, you can levy against the branch or address listed for the registered agent. Depending.\n\nIf you must levy on a bank that is solely doing business in New Jersey, then you would domesticate your judgment in the courts of New Jersey.\n\nHere are some instructions from the state of New Jersey:\n\nhttp://www.judiciary.state.nj.us/prose/10519_docket_foreign_judgmts.pdf"

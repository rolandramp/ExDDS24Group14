    "title": "My father died on Jan 10 in Florida. He had NO will. Had NO assets. Has remaining medical bills. Am I obligated to pay that?",
    "question": "I was representative payee for his VA \"Aid & Attendance\" pension. I was his POA. He received SS and a work pension also. All of his pension funds went to pay his Assisted Living Facility. So he went in arrears on the medical bills. I was receiving his mail but could not and still can not afford to pay those bills. I myself filed chapter 13 BK on Jan 2, 2015. I notified one debtor that he died but they want me to make payment arrangements. I NEVER signed an agreement with any of his debtors to pay his bills. There is no way for me to do so.",

        "As a general principle of law, the debts of a person who dies become debts of his estate. The executor or administrator of the estate is responsible to pay the debts of the estate out of the assets of the estate. If the debts of the estate exceed the assets of the estate, the estate is insolvent. Absent an agreement to do so, the adult offspring of a decedent has no legal obligation to pay the debts of the estate out of the adult offspring's assets. But, as an article which appeared in the New York Times in 2009 points out, \"that won't stop the debt collector\" from trying to collect from the relatives of the decedent.",
        "Your father's estate will be the one responsible to pay for any bills. You personally will not be responsible.",
        "Sorry for your loss. You are likely not liable for any of your father's debts, unless you signed a guaranty agreement.",
        "It appears your father passed away without an estate. In that event, you are not obligated to pay his bills, unless you personally agreed or agree to do so. However, you do need to notify all his creditors of his death and notify the credit reporting bureaus of his death."

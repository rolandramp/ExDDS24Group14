    "title": "Community Property question in California divorce case",
    "question": "Is it alright to check \"There are no such assets or debts that I know of to be divided\" if the petitioner doesn't want any claims over the shared home with the respondent? It's a community property. The petitioner is alright with her having it, hence not sure how properly treat that section of the form because the alternative option is \"Determine rights to community assets and debts. All such assets are listed...\"",

        "While the two of you may have an agreement that you are going to keep the home that does not mean you have no property. The language of the form is unfortunate because what \"to be divided\" really means, is to be determined and distributed. Even if you had only separate property you would want it confirmed as your separate property. You do have to disclose all property whether it is community or separate -- twice unless you waive the final. Even if you actually did not have any property you would have to file a preliminary declaration of disclosure in order to get the judgment entered. If you and you spouse really do have an agreement about you keeping the house there should not be any problem creating a stipulated judgment awarding you the home. It would be interesting to know what you are doing about the mortgage -- assuming there is one -- because both spouses are still responsible to the lender. Also, it looks to me like you think \"property\" means real estate. It does not -- it means anything, including but not limited to vehicles, bank accounts, pensions and retirement funds (even if they are only in the name of one of the spouses), and your furniture. There are few, if any, married couples that do not have anything at all. You need to consult with an attorney so you have the information you need to represent yourself. Ending a marriage and dividing property is a significant transaction even if the parties agree about what they want.",
        "I am assuming your referring to the Petition for Dissolution of Marriage form FL-100. By checking that there are no such assets or debts your implying that no property exists; however, from your description there is property to be divided. Checking that box doesn't mean the property division must be litigated in front of a judge it simply alerts the court and other interested parties that property exists that must be dealt with in the divorce proceedings. Then you can make whatever agreements you want, put it in writing and ask the Court to divide your property pursuant to your agreement.\n\nWhen real property is involved it is always a very good idea to seek help in drafting the agreement, deeds, judgment, etc. If you cant or don't want to pay for help from an experienced attorney there are free resources you can utilize to help you with the basics. That information will be available at your local courthouse.",
        "I encourage you to have a consultation with a competent attorney to (a) find out about the means of resolving dissolution proceedings in California (generally, the judge only decides property division if the parties don't agree); (b) get feedback on the agreements you're contemplating and how to best structure them; and (c) get info about filling out forms. You'll get an incredible amount of information in that one consultation and it may save you many headaches (and money) down the road. Best to you.",
        "In a divorce, you MUST disclose all assets and debts regardless of their community or separate property character and even if you have decided on how to divide them. If you actually don't know the extent of them, then you can reserve the right to file the property declarations once you have discovered them.",
        "It sounds like you and your spouse have reached an agreement regarding how the community property should be divided. If that's the case then you could write in \"Pursuant to the parties' agreement\" on the Petition. If you know the date that the agreement was reached that should be stated as well.\n\nIf not, then you should write in something which indicates that the true nature and extent of the community property interests has not yet been determined. This will reserve the right for you to assert any claims you may have at the time of trial or later in the case.\n\nYou should not state there are no assets to be divided because it sounds like there is at least one such asset...the home. That asset will need to be allocated either according to a settlement agreement or pursuant to court order."

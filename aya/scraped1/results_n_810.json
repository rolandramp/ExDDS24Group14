        "Father-in-Law's US debts, even tax debts, usually can't be enforced against his children or heirs personally unless they were co- borrowers or taxpayers with him in a business or something. Hoever, those US debts, especially tax debt, can often be enforced against property he owned here, even if it is now in the possession of his heirs. In other words, you most likely don't owe his debt, but you may have property of his that his creditors are entitled to.\n\nIf you're talking about foreign (non-US) debt being enforced here, this seems like a remote possibility unless the amount is very large. You should speak with an experienced attorney in your area and let him or her ask lots of questions. Then they can let you know whether or here is any risk to you. Good luck.",
        "I am sorry to hear about your father-in-law's passing. You mentioned that he MAY have debts here in the United States. Any creditor whom your father-in-law owed money to can now come after his estate and ask to be paid through his estate. This is of course assuming he owned anything of value at the time of his death.

    "title": "How can I disclaim a worthless timeshare inheritance?",
    "question": "My father died this Spring with few assets and so qualified as a 'small estate' in California; therefore, we did not open probate. I, as his executrix, have dealt with most of his assets and debts using a 13100 affidavit of small estate. He has a worthless timeshare. How do I disclaim that inheritance? With whom do I file the disclaimer as there is no probate judge; the timeshare company? The county records office? What documentation is needed?",

        "Mr. Frederick is correct. Your two easiest options would be to either allow the timeshare company to foreclose on the timeshare interest or transfer title to the interest so that you can donate it to an acceptable charity. Best of luck.",
        "You might simply walk away and allow the timeshare company to eventually foreclose on this interest. Alternatively, you could attempt to donate this timeshare to charity. There are many charities which accept timeshare donations. This ends up being a win-win for everybody, in that case. You would still need to get this interest assigned to you, if you take the latter option, because you cannot transfer something that you do not have title to.\n\nJames Frederick"

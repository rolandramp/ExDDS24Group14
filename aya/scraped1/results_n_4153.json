    "question": "Just wondering if on the means test a leased car gets to take all of the same deductions as a purchased car.",
    "answers": [
        "As to your specific question, Yes. On the means test a leased car is counted for the same expenses as a car you are purchasing or own. From your question I imagine you are wanting to keep the car. If you are keeping the car, you will want to reaffirm (at least in my district) or you will not be allowed to keep it. Check with a bankruptcy attorney in your area to see if the same is true there.",
        "Although I agree with the other attorney answers, what is left out also is whether you are actually keeping the vehicle or not..Are you behind now? However, even if you are caught up and have the current \"intent\" to keep it so you can pass that test, later if you change your mind post bankruptcy you can walk away and not owe the creditor any monies..(assuming no reaffirmation agreement is done which most attorneys do NOT approve of unless there is a reason therefor). Good luck.",
        "Yep its the same! Hope this perspective helps.",
        "The lease payment is counted the same as if you owned the car and were making loan payments. There is no effect on the outcome on the Means Test whether you lease or purchase.",
        "You can count the car in both the operating expense category and the ownership/lease category. The same deduction amounts apply."

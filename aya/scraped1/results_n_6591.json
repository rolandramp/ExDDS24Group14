    "title": "Is spouse responsible for her husband's medical debt when he passes away?",
    "question": "My 83 year old husband has had cancer for 10 years. He has accumulated alot of medical bills that Medicare does not cover. Will I have to be responsible for this debt upon his death? We do not own a home. He has no assets. I have always kept my own savings and checking account. Since we were married 15 years ago, we have never co-mingle our money. What is his is his. What is mine is mine. We live in California. His only asset is his social security check which is about $600.00 a month. If I am going to be responsible, I will file for a divorce now. Do not want the responsibility.",

        "An adult child is responsible for a deceased parent's medical expenses only if he is listed as a guarantor for any expenses not covered by health insurance. However, a family member who has signed an agreement to guarantee payment of a medical bill will be held liable for those charges. A surviving spouse is responsible for unpaid medical bills only in community property states, or in other states if she has agreed to guarantee payment. In a community property state--Arizona, California, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Washington, and Wisconsin--unsecured debts acquired during a couple's marriage are considered to be held jointly, and the surviving spouse is responsible for repayment. In other states, a surviving spouse is only liable for credit cards that bear his name, either alone or with the deceased spouse. The surviving spouse is also responsible for the repayment of any debt for which she co-signed."

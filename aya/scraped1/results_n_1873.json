        "Well, if you have community property, a creditor might be able to attach joint property - such as a joint bank account, a jointly titled house or a joint tax return.\n\nIf you divorce the court will see debts from before the marriage as his separate debt.\n\nA prenuptial agreement will protect you to some extent but should be recorded to give notice. A prenuptial agreement will not protect you when joint property is seized.\n\nSee the terms of FC 910 and onward: 910. (a) Except as otherwise expressly provided by statute, the\ncommunity estate is liable for a debt incurred by either spouse before or during marriage, regardless of which spouse has the management and control of the property and regardless of whether one or both spouses are parties to the debt or to a judgment for the debt.",

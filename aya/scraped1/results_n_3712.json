    "title": "I need a bankruptcy attorney who accepts payment plans in Stockton, CA.",
    "question": "I need to file Chapter 7. I am single mother of two. I am employed, but I am considered in the \"low income\" bracket. I need a attorney that will set me up on a payment plan. If anyone has information of a bankruptcy attorney in Stockton, that can assist me, please leave comments with information on here.",

        "You will find many lawyers that would be willing to set up a payment schedule for you. However, in Chapter 7 the attorney must be paid in full before filing the case. Otherwise they would be just another unsecured creditor discharged in the bankruptcy.\n\nI think you would be best served by focusing on finding the \"right lawyer,\" that is one who you are comfortable with and you feel trust in. Here are a few suggestions that might be of help:\n\nDo yourself a huge favor and see a quality bankruptcy attorney, not someone who is a \"part time\" bankruptcy attorney. You may be low income but that does not automatically mean that everything you have is protected or that you are a good candidate for filing bankruptcy at all. Bankruptcy is a tool. That is all it is. There are other tools and they should be looked at as well.\n\nYour case would be filed in the Bankruptcy Court in Sacramento though your \"creditor's meeting\" would be in Modesto. I would recommend you find a quality bankruptcy attorney by looking at Avvo ratings for Sacramento, Stockton or Modesto attorneys.\n\nYou could also look at the CA State bar website for a Certified Bankruptcy Law Specialist in Sacramento, San Joaquin and Stanislaus Counties. Most attorneys will give you are free initial consultation. Some in Sacramento will be willing to do a telephonic consultation though in person is preferable if possible.\n\nAnother potential source for finding a good attorney would be through a search of the National Association of Consumer Bankruptcy Attorneys (NACBA.org) or a combination of all 3.\n\nDo NOT use an attorney that does anything other than bankruptcy law, foreclosure or debt negotiation. Part-time bankruptcy attorneys are, sadly, almost never knowledgeable enough to do the job right. This is a specialized field and you should go with an attorney who practices solely in that specialty. Never hire to veterinarian's assistant to do brain surgery on you and never hire a non-specialist to do a specialists job. Get the right attorney to begin with.\n\nLinks are attached below\nI hope this helps you.",
        "Your best bet would be to use the Find A Lawyer tab on this website for a list of reputable attorneys near you. The good news is most bankruptcy attorneys will work with you on the fees (myself included).",
        "Most bankruptcy attorneys in the area will take cases on a payment basis, and file after the fees are paid in full. Check the Avvo website Find a Lawyer or your local county bar for their lawyer referral service.",
        "Make a few phone calls to bankruptcy attorneys to see what they will do for you to help with fees - this firm included, some lawyers will be able to begin acting as your attorney and structure a payment plan to until your fees are paid (most attorneys will NOT file your case until all fees are paid, however... and this is correct). Some lawyers that I know even offer reduced fees for people with a true hardship or unable to afford standard fees for chapter 7 bankruptcy. We are a state-wide law firm and enjoy representing clients throughout California, however you may wish to locate someone local to you if that is important... just be sure to check around and you should be able to find what you're seeking.\n\nBest of luck!",
        "The issue is whether you are trying to make payments over time and then file (which I allow clients to do over 5 months) or are you trying to file and then make payments. If the latter, that is actually a dischargeable debt even though the attorney may be entitled to monies for quantum meruit for payment of post petition work. Attorney Larkin I would strongly urge you to use..I have seen her many many answers herein and have even endorsed her as her answers are right, complete, and to the point. Good luck."

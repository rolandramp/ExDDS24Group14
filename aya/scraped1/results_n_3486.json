        "Since you mention CCP 96 and 98, I assume you are in a limited jurisdiction court since a Section 98 declaration in lieu of live testimony can only be used in a limited jurisdiction case. If your case is pending in Los Angeles Superior Court, you need to comply with the local rules with respect to motions in limine. Los Angeles Superior Court Local Rule 3.57 requires motions made for the purpose of precluding the mention or display of inadmissible and prejudicial matter in the presence of the jury must be accompanied by a declaration which includes the following:\n\n(1) Specific identification of the matter alleged to be inadmissible and prejudicial;\n\n(2) A representation to the court that the subject of the motion has been discussed with opposing counsel, and that opposing counsel has either indicated that such matter will be mentioned or displayed in the presence of the jury before it is admitted in evidence or that counsel has refused to stipulate that such matter will not be mentioned or displayed in the presence of the jury unless and until it is admitted in evidence;\n\n(3) A statement of the specific prejudice that will be suffered by the moving party if the motion is not granted; and\n\n(4) If the motion seeks to make binding an answer given in response to discovery, the declaration must set forth the question and the answer and state why the use of the answer for impeachment will not adequately protect the moving party against prejudice in the event that evidence inconsistent with the answer is offered.\n\nIf you are trying to preclude the testimony of the declarant of the CCP 98 declaration in lieu of live testimony, you need to first subpoena that person to appear at trial and demonstrate in your motion in limine that you did so. Generally speaking, motions in limine for a limited jurisdiction non-jury trial are rarely granted because the judge knows what evidence should be considered and what evidence is not relevant.\n\nYour hope is that the declarant witness fails to show up at trial, in which case, you can argue to the court that the plaintiff failed to prove its case and have a judgment rendered in your favor. You most likely won't even need a motion in limine. Good luck!",

        "Not sure which jurisdiction you are in, limited or unlimited.\n\nYou need to look up in limine motions but under the court rules and local rules, in limines are usually filed at the threshold of trial which is what they mean.\n\nUnder CCP 98 you are asking the Court to take testimony via affidavit rather than live testimony. This suggests that you're in limited jurisdiction. If you're in small claims, affidavits and hearsay are generally admissible, but not on trials de novo, generally.\n\nCCP 96 is a demand for witnesses and statements.\n\nYou should have all of this out and filed 45 days before trial. The Motion in Limine need not be specially set on motion day. All you need do is file the MIL and note the trial date, time and department number. It is heard at trial or on pretrial conference usually the day before trial or day of trial. UNLESS local rules require it be set on motion day.\n\nTypically I do a MIL shortly before trial after completing discovery. The alternative MIL is filed when the opposition objects to every request for production and interrogatory. In that case I have my MIL objecting to the use of any evidence they refuse to produce. Compelling is costly and its easier to keep it all out UNLESS the evidence is critical to the case.\n\nHope this helps but your question is mixing pears, apples and oranges and I get the pearles-anges angle."

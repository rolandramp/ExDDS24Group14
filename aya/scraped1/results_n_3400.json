    "title": "Ex controls access to my personal property, insists on removing it before divorce judgement, calling it abandoned property.",
    "question": "I left my personal belongings (car & all) in CA. My husband filed for divorce and now 99% of what I own remains in his control. I inventoried much of it on the FL-142, including my car. I was later mailed (USPS) a letter calling it almost worthless (valued >$300); telling me \"comply with removing the \"abandoned property\" within 2 weeks or risk losing it all. I responded, enlisting a friend to help remove it. Ex caused delays/wouldn't talk. Friend asked his mother/property owner to coordinate removal. After one failed attempt she flipped out on my friend. They insist on property being removed all at once or not at all. My friend can only do it piecemeal. I am wondering what I can possibly do to remedy the situation?",
    "answers": [
        "I agree with my colleague. Technically, your husband would be in violation of the automatic restraining orders on the reverse of the summons if he disposes of any of your property. That said, the remedy is possibly more costly than replacement value of the property. I realize there's nothing fair about this, but one wonders if you might not be better off chalking to yourself to bitter experience and walking away.",
        "I get the sense that your friend's situation is a red herring. I'd pay someone to get all of the stuff out at once or accept that your finances preclude you any legal or extralegal remedy.",
        "My solution will require an attorney, because you are living out of state. You need to file a Request for Orders (RFO) for return of personal property. You will list all the property, use your FL-142 Schedule of Assets and Debts as an Exhibit, and include texts and emails with your husband about trying to get your property back. The Court will order certain dates/times that you can remove your belongings, whether all at once or in several trips. In the meantime, send a \"cease and desist\" letter saying that nothing should be removed, that you have not abandoned any property, and that any property removed/sold/destroyed will have to be replaced or reimbursement provided, and that the issue will be raised with the Court."

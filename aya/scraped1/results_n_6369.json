    "title": "My ex-wife had a Verizon Wireless account set-up at our apartment that had hi-speed internet and phone. The account was set-up",
    "question": "before we were married and only in her name. At the date of Seperation, (we just finished our divorce), she contacted Verizon Wireless and said she would be leaving the apartment and had the Merchant Vendor transfer her account into my name solely. This was done without my knowledge or permission/authorization. I checked my credit report and there was a credit inquiry that hit my credit reports. She provided my social security card numbers and had them authorize a credit check before transferring service into my name. I spent days with Verizon to remove or transfer back to no avail. It is now in collections and is impacting my credit negatively with a balance. What legal actions could I take to resolve? I filed a report with LAPD Fraud dept, but their detectives are overloaded.",

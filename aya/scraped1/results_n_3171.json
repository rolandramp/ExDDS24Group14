    "title": "I am being sued for a personal loan I took out with One Main Financial. What should I do?",
    "question": "I am being sued for a personal loan. I have yet to receive the papers, but I know I will be receiving them soon since I just got a phone call. I plan on attending the hearing. I owe about $5,000. I cannot afford to pay them at this time as I work full-time and my wage is $12.50hr. I have a vehicle, but have a lienholder until sometime next year. Can they take my car once it is paid off? I am a single mom with three children, and go to school full-time. I receive food stamps from the county just to get by, and medi-cal insurance for my children & I. Can I fill out a claim exemption form, so my wages are not garnished. I need every cent I get each month, and am afraid I will not be able to provide for my children.",

        "If you get served by a creditor and you wish to set it for trial, you must file a response. If you fail to file a response the matter will not be set for trial and there will be no automatic hearing. Based on the facts you describe you have several options. If the creditor obtains a judgment then you may be able to file a claim of exemptions to stop the wage garnishment or to address a bank levy. I have placed a link below that describes how to stop a wage garnishment. As also mentioned before, you can also consider filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection. A qualified attorney can review your facts and determine if bankruptcy is a good options for you.",
        "Look into the possibility of filing a Chapter 7 bankruptcy, especially if you have any other outstanding debts (medical bills, past-due utilities, credit cards etc.). Chapter 7 is the type of bankruptcy designed for folks who legitimately cannot afford to pay anything towards their debts.",
        "One possible solution is to file for a Chapter 7 Bankruptcy. Given your income limitations and inability to pay, a Chapter 7 will relieve you of your obligation to pay this loan, any of its additional fees and interest, along with any other unsecured debt that you may be struggling with. The goal of the Bankruptcy is to demonstrate to your creditors what are your best efforts for satisfying the debt at this moment. In your case, you would only have to show that your income is below average and that you have no surplus items of value that could be sold to benefit your creditors. (In the case of your car, you would subtract from its value the amount of the loan still due on that vehicle.) To find out what portions of your property is exempted from the reach of your creditors and what is considered surplus, consult a local bankruptcy attorney using this site."

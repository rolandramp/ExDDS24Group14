        "My colleagues are correct. Provided that you act within the scope of the DPOA as agent, you should not be personally liable for your father's debts. However, be very careful in executing documents on his behalf that you include a notation that you are signing as the agent for your father under the DPOA.",
        "I agree with Attorney Pippen. As long as you are acting within your authority as Agent under the POA, then your father's liabilities are his alone. Be careful not to sign anything, particularly anything seeking a \"responsible party\", without making sure it is clear you are acting under the POA form.\n\nJames Frederick",
        "Answer-anyone can be sued.\nYou should sign anything concerning your\nDad as POA for him.\nThe end result would be that his assets would be in jeopardy-not yours.\nThere are limited circumstances where you could have some liability."

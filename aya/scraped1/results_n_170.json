        "You have received good responses from my colleagues and I agree with their comments regarding your retirement account. I too urge you to speak with a bankruptcy attorney for assistance in order to fully understand all options - bankruptcy and non-bankruptcy. Depending upon other assets you may have, with only one debt, there may be other options to consider other than filing bankruptcy. Seek assistance from a qualified, experienced bankruptcy attorney. Good Luck.",
        "Yes. Unsecured credit card debts are generally dischargeable in BK.\nQualified 401(k) accounts are exempt assets and protected from being seized by BK trustee.",
        "I also agree with my colleagues. Your 401k should not be impacted by your bankruptcy. Most retirement accounts including 401ks are protected. With that said it is a wise move to hire a bankruptcy attorney to help you through the process.",
        "I agree with my colleagues. 401k plans are completely exempt in bankruptcy. You get to keep the assets you have in the plan. I urge you to retain a bankruptcy lawyer to help you with filing. You will get peace of mind and know it's done right.",
        "Retirement accounts, including 401Ks are fully exempt in a Chapter 7 BK. Your sole SS income will allow you to \"pass\" the Means Test easily. You should be an excellent prospect for a Chapter 7. Remember, BK is more than checking boxes on obsolete forms you find on line. Find/consult/hire a lawyer in your area using the Avvo feature \"Find a Lawyer\". Make a list of 4-5 having many 5 star reviews from satisfied clients. If you don't get a prompt call back from one, go on to the next on your list. Some offer a free consultation by phone or in person. Good luck and God bless.",
        "Qualified retirement accounts, including 401ks, are protected (exempted) in any bankruptcy case (up to a limit that I've never seen anyone reach)."

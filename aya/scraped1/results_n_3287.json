        "Agree with colleagues. Check Superior Court website to find a case, if one exists. If you cannot pay the bill, it may be dischargeable in BK. Consult counsel.",
        "Don't worry about it until you actually receive a summons and complaint. That said, most county superior court records are online and you can do a name search.",
        "Mr. Stempler is correct. You can search your county's Superior Court's docket either online, or if its not available online by going to the courthouse and having the clerk assist you in searching to find out if you've been sued.\n\nIf you have not been served but the docket indicates someone was served, you should look into that.\n\nI would also suggest you consult with an attorney in your area over this. Click on \"Find a Lawyer\" above and set up an appointment with someone to assist you in handling this matter.",
        "Many superior courts in California can be searched for a small fee or free. I have a legal guide on those online court services, or you can go to a nearby courthouse to find out. If you are in Los Angeles county, for instance, go to www.LASuperiorCourt.org. If you need more help, contact your local court clerk or a debt collection DEFENSE attorney. Don't try to handle a court case alone, against a professional debt collection law firm.\n\nBy: Robert Stempler (please see DISCLAIMER below)\nCONSUMER LAW OFFICE OF ROBERT STEMPLER\nA Professional Law Corporation"

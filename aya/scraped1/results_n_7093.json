    "title": "Can I use a General Denial form ? ( California)",
    "question": "A collection agency, on behalf of Bank One is suing me for $4000-credit card debt.",
    "answers": [
        "Bank One has been out of business for several years. Moreover, their cardholder agreement has a Delaware choice of law provision, making the statute of limitations 3 years instead of the normal 4 years. You should seek the advise of an experienced debt collection defense attorney before filing an Answer. If the consumer account is beyond the statute of limitations, you may be able to get an attorney to represent you at no cost.",
        "Yes, you can use the General Denial form so long as the complaint is not \"verified\". A verified complaint is one in which the last page (or somewhere at the end of the complaint) it has a declaration from someone stating that the information and allegations are true and correct under penalty of perjury.\n\nIf the complaint is not verified, you can use the General Denial form. (I know, it is somewhat confusing on the form itself).",
        "If you do not recognize the debt, you should dispute it immediately. Is the debt on your credit report? Which law firm is suing?\n\nTo dispute credit report errors, you should:\n\n1.

Tell the credit reporting companies what information is incorrect in your credit report. Include documents that support your position. State the facts and exactly why you dispute the information, and request that the inaccuracy be removed or corrected. It is also helpful to enclose a copy of your credit report with your dispute and circle the items that are incorrect. Your dispute letter should include your: (1) full legal name, (2) date of birth, (3) social security number, (4) current mailing address, and (5) a copy of your driver’s license.\n\n3.

        "For bankruptcy purposes the terms \"civil action' and \"civil case\" are interchangeable. Generally, when the term \"civil\" in relation to any type of court action comes up, it means the action is not criminal. Thus if you sue someone for trespass in the civil courts, you cannot get criminal penalties from the Defendant, and if the Defendant filed a bankruptcy the matter would be stayed. The DA would sue for criminal trespass, for criminal penalties and the filing of a bankruptcy would not stay the action. Just because the civil matter is stayed doesn't necessarily mean the debt will be discharged, however. There are provisions in the bankruptcy laws that state what is an isn't dischargeable, and \"civil trespass\" MIGHT fall within those categories. If you are concerned in that regard, I would recommend you discuss the matter with experienced bankruptcy counsel.",

        "A civil action or case is any lawsuit that is not a criminal matter. As a result, generally speaking, bankruptcy probably will stop any kind of civil lawsuit from proceeding.

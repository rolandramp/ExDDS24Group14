        "A chapter 7 bankruptcy is probably not going to help you at this point considering you filed one within the last 8 years and received a discharge. A chapter 13 bankruptcy may help you, but you will need to show for some sort of income to support your monthly chapter 13 plan payments. Also, you will need an experienced bankruptcy attorney to examine your assets among other things. I suggest setting up a consultation with an experienced bankruptcy attorney.",
        "The answers given about the inability to receive a discharge in a chapter 7 are accurate. I would add some information about what happens in a chapter 13 case.\n\nMany of my clients come with the thought that they can't afford to file a chapter 13 because the cannot afford to pay off all their debt over 5 years. What they don't understand is that there are two factors that are used to determine how much the debtors must pay to unsecured debt in a chapter 13.\n\nFirst, you must pay the amount of your disposable income that is available to pay unsecured claims, and second, you must also pay the amount that unsecured creditors would receive in a chapter 7 liquidation. If all the assets you own are exempt assets, unsecured creditors would receive $0.00 in a chapter 7 liquidation, and your income is such that you have no money available to pay anything to unsecured creditors, you would qualify for a zero percent plan in our district. That means at the end of the plan, all of your dischargeable debt would be discharged even though those creditors were paid nothing during the term of the plan.",

        "You are not eligible for a discharge if you file chapter 7. You should contact a local bankruptcy attorney and schedule a consultation. After running the means test you may find you are eligible to file chapter 13 and have a 3-year plan. If you are over median income you would have to propose a 5-year plan. You would need to wait another 2 years to file chapter 7 again. If you pass the means test and are only required to file a 3-year plan you could be eligible for a discharge a year later than waiting to file chapter 7 in two years. Keep in mind if your income improves while waiting to file chapter 7 you may find yourself no longer eligible for a chapter 7 in 2 years.

        "Well, filing Ch7 would accomplish nothing since it's been less than 8 yrs since your last one and you would not be entitled to a discharge of any debts. You could try to hold out for 2 more years and then file your Ch7 and hope that the creditors don't do anything drastic during that time (other than harass you with letters and phone calls). If that becomes too burdensome and stressful, you can always file a Ch13 to get them off your back and start making minimal payments, whatever you can afford, until the 8 yrs (from prior filing date) are up. Then, if you still qualify for Ch7, you would dismiss the Ch13 and file your Ch7 ... or, you can remain in your Ch13 for another year, complete your Plan, and receive a discharge of whatever was not paid. (You would be entitled to that discharge because your Ch13 was filed at least four years after your Ch7.)"

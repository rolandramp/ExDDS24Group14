    "title": "My sister passed away and I am the executor. She has a mobile home that needs to be sold however the loan for it is in her name",
    "question": "How can I get the authority to sell the home? I was thinking provide the bank with the death certificate? I'm wondering if there is anything else I should do? I am the executor and she has a will.",
    "answers": [
        "How title to the mobile home is held is important, not who signed the loan. Depending on the other assets and how title is held, and whether you are the sole beneficiary (not executor) under the Will, a small estate affidavit as suggested by colleague may be the answer. I suggest you invest in a consultation with a probate attorney and, perhaps, retain that attorney to represent you so that things go smoothly. The will needs to be review for accurate advice. BTW, you are not an executor unless and until you are appointed by the court. Hopefully, an expensive and formal probate can be avoided. Good luck.",
        "First of all, I'm sorry for your loss.\n\nIf your sister's estate is valued at less that $150k when she passed with no real property, you should be able to send them a small estate affidavit along with a copy of your sister's will, death certificate, and other items listed on the CA Courts webpage listed below. This affidavit and supporting evidence allows you to take control of your sister's estate and outstanding debts so that you may administer it. Follow the steps listed on this site and you should be all set! (http://www.courts.ca.gov/10440.htm)",
        "You MAY need to file a Petition for Probate IF the total value of all of her assets exceeds $150,000. It is highly recommended you consult with an experienced Probate attorney to explore your options in light of the facts. If the Will is valid, it may control how the property is dispositioned.",
        "Agree with colleagues. Form of title of mobile home very important.

        "You will need to file a petition to probate her estate and be appointed as the Administrator of her estate and get Letters of Administration. Just because you are named in the Will as the executor, doesn't make it automatic. You must file the petition to have the Will admitted to probate and go through the entire probate process. You should seek the services of a probate attorney."

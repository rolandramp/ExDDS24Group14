    "title": "What should I do about unpaid HOA dues after foreclosure and bankruptcy?",
    "question": "I lost my job in 2009, and after 9 month's of trying to make payments with my savings, I finally gave up. I filed ch 7 BK in July 2010, it was finalized in Nov. 2010. The bank didn't foreclose on my property until Dec. of 2011. I moved out of the house in Dec. of 2010 thinking the bank was going to foreclose much faster than they actually did.",

        "You are in the catch 22 of bankruptcy. Post petition filing HOA dues are not dischargeable and lenders are very slow to foreclose on properties with HOA dues because they don't want to pay them either. It is why I tell my clients to stay in the property until the bitter end or rent it out for the value of your non-mortgage expenses. You might try offering to quit claim the property to the HOA and they can rent it out until the bank forecloses. I was at a seminar an a fellow attorney said he had some success with that strategy.",
        "HOA dues accrued pre-filing can be discharged. HOA fees that accrue post-filing for as long as the debtor holds an interest in the property are made nondischargeable by application of Section 523(a)(16) of the Bankruptcy Code. The HOA association can sue to collect such fees after the grant of discharge and closing of the bankruptcy case. The problem for many debtors is that unless the property is sold, whether in a traditional sale, a short sale or a foreclosure sale, the debtor remains on title to the property and therefore liable for the accruing post-filing HOA dues. With lenders delaying the foreclosure process more and more, this can create a serious problem for the debtor.\n\nOn the other hand, most HOA dues are also assessed as liens against the property, and no purchaser of the property will accept title if the unpaid liens are not satisfied through escrow. As a result, when the property is eventually sold, the nondischargeable HOA dues that accrued post-filing and which were assessed as a lien on the property tend to get paid.",
        "Bankruptcy only discharges debts made before you filed. So if the $11K in HOA dues & penalties occurred after you filed, the HOA can sue you, obtain a court judgment & start to seize property, such as garnishing your wages or attaching a bank account, to collect. HOAs typically do not sue in small claims where it is easy to show up & respond - they will sue in the bigger court system designed for the bright lawyers to duke it out.\n\nIf you can find some way of coming up with a lump sum of cash, you may be able to persuade a debt collector to settle for less than full payment.

    "title": "Mother reopens child support case in retaliation for ex-con father not agreeing to reestablish relationship with her.",
    "question": "This is about my brother. He was just released from an 18-year sentence in prison. The child in question is now 23. Mother reopened the child support case recently upon finding out my brother was in a relationship with someone else. She began harassing my brother with numerous texts and calls, and myself as well when I inquired about her threats to \"take him down.\" In her texts, she has clearly stated she wants his assets, and the reason for her reopening the case was due to my brother not fulfilling his \"promises\", which we presume she believed he would return to her upon his release. We have saved the texts, and the phone records substantiate her aggressive nature. He does not return her texts or calls. He has left messages for the case manager to discuss this matter, but no response.",

        "If your brother has been in prison for 18 years, that that's 18 years that he could NOT pay support. Sadly, he probably never filed a motion with court to modify the support orders, and he may have a hard time modifying it retroactively.\n\nBesides that, there is the child support that he MAY owe for the child's first five years; it is unclear from your description whether this was ever paid.\n\nYour brother needs to consult with an attorney, and not rely upon the DCSS case workers to \"handle\" it for him.",
        "I agree with my colleagues above. In California, under Family Code section 3900, both parents have an \"equal responsibility to support their child in the manner suitable to the child's circumstances.\" Public policy is so strongly in favor of holding parents responsible for supporting their children that under federal law child support obligations are one of the limited types of debts that are nondischargeable even in bankruptcy. Therefore, the mother's motives for attempting to collect on this debt are likely irrelevant.\nHowever, Family Code section 4007.5 provides that any child support obligation \"shall be suspended for any period exceeding 90 consecutive days in which the person ordered to pay support is incarcerated or involuntarily institutionalized, unless the obligor has the means to pay support while incarcerated or involuntarily institutionalized.\"\nSo, unless your brother had the means to pay the child support while he was in prison for those 18 years, then it is likely that the amount of support he owes should be limited to the amount accrued when your brother was free during the child's first five years.\nHowever, DCSS may have kept accruing support owed in your brother's case by mistake. I would definitely have your brother consult with an attorney as he may need to file a motion to adjust the amount of support that he owes.",
        "Her reasons for reopening the case - as well as any of her text messages - are irrelevant to the debt being owed and his obligation to pay it. That is not to say that one should condone the behavior but this is most likely why DCSS has not returned any calls to discuss the matter."

    "title": "Can I spend less than $500 on a Nordstrom credit card for badly needed clothes for work within 90 days of filing bankruptcy?",
    "question": "So I know that if you spend more than $500, some sites I've seen $650, on a single creditor account 70-90 days before filling bankruptcy, you may risk the debt not being discharged and sued by the creditor. I'm wondering, can I buy some clothes from Nordstroms, mostly work clothes, and keep it under $500 and not get into trouble with my bankruptcy? I would be filing ch. 7 bankruptcy by April 1st, so way before the 90 day mark, but as long as it's under the luxury amount, would this be okay?",
    "answers": [
        "Borrowing with no intent to pay it back is fraud. Will you get away with it? Maybe. Maybe not. Good faith debtors are entitled to discharge.",
        "See the responses to the same question you posted today: Can I spend less than the luxury amount on a card to buy work clothes within the 90 day period before filing for bankruptcy?",
        "No it is not \"OK\". You really need to retain an experienced CA Bankruptcy attorney. If you want to buy clothes for \"work\" there are plenty of more affordable stores than Nordstroms. To properly answer your questions and address your concerns, the best way to handle this is with an in person consultation with an experienced CA bankruptcy and matrimonial attorney. Use AVVO's Find a Lawyer tool to select a qualified attorney. THIS IS NOT LEGAL ADVICE! YOU NEED TO SPEAK TO AN ATTORNEY WHO IS LICENSED IN YOUR STATE FOR LEGAL ADVICE. This is merely suggestions for you to think about in discussing your situation with the local attorney."

    "title": "Credit card law (avoiding fraud)",
    "question": "wondering if a situation such as the following would cause criminal charges to be filed. currently owe $40k of credit card debt and have an extra credit limit of $20k that can still be withdrawn from the cards for use. now keep in mind that these are all personal credit cards that have been used to fund business operating and some personal expenses. the plan is ultimately to stop paying on the cards 3 months from now and just wait things out to try and obtain a settlement from either the original credit card company or from the collection agency that the debt would be assigned to once it is charged off. would it be illegal (by illegal i mean that it could result in prosecution) to withdraw some of the remaining credit limit in order to fund some legitimate business expenses?",

        "Credit Card Fraud has more to do with using \"another persons\" credit or credit card to purchase or obtain funds; or it has to do with intentionally obtaining credit with false information (beyond misstating income, but by using a false ID or other material misrepresentations) So, using your own available credit is not going to rise to the level of criminal behavior except in the extreme case (e.g. having $150,000 in available credit, charging it all up in a short period of time, say 3 months, and hiding out in the Cook Islands).\n\nHowever, what you are contemplating is a type of civil fraud that most frequently turns up when someone files bankruptcy. If the creditor can show you used credit with the actual intent not to repay or no reasonable belief that you could repay, then the debt would not be discharged in bankruptcy.\n\nOutside of the bankruptcy context, the issue of small \"f\" fraud (as I call it) is seldom raised.\n\nLastly, keep in mind that your \"plan\" may not end like you hope. Settlement is hit or miss; most people who attempt the settlement route find they don't have the money to pay all the settlements (lump sum), or a creditor holds out and sues before enough funds are available. Once a creditor sues, although settlement is still \"on the table\" the amount required to settle shoots up significantly. Finally, if you do settle, make sure you understand the tax consequences. For example, if you settle $60K of debt for $25K, the IRS treats the unpaid $35K as taxable income.",
        "Credit card fraud is seldom prosecuted by the authorities because for the most part, people who have credit appreciate the value of being able to access credit for personal, business & emergency use. As a general principal, continuing to use credit when you have neither the intent nor the reasonable expectation of being able to repay it is a criminal offense. Hope this perspective helps!"

        "FTB is the franchise tax board the state equivalent of the IRS. It wouldn't make sense that they would attempt to collect from a debt. You should be able to fill\nOut an exemption form to avoid a bank levy or garnishment.",
        "By FTB I assume you mean Franchise Tax Board, correct? Generally speaking, filing for bankruptcy may discharge taxes that are at least three years old, and no new assessment had been done for the past 8 calendar months. Once the bankruptcy is filed, all liens placed on your personal properties, including bank accounts, will stop. Under most states' law, income from social disability is exempt from judgment/lien/garnishment.",
        "Unless this is for back taxes I don't see why the FTB would be involved. I am reposting this under debt settlement."

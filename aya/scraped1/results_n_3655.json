    "title": "How do I stop a Writ of Execution and levy on my bank account by a collection agency?",
    "question": "A default judgment was entered against me and I never knew I was being sued, as I never received any documentation from the law firm and collection agency who sued me. I had no idea I was being sued until they sent a notice telling me they were going to take my bank account and garnish my wages.",
    "answers": [
        "You should contact an attorney in San Diego to find out what your options are. You could have the judgment set aside if you were not properly served with the summons and complaint. Alternatively, you may wish to consider filing for bankruptcy relief. A competent San Diego debtor's attorney should offer, as I do, a free one-hour consultation to discuss your options.",
        "My colleague is correct. You will need to file a motion to set aside the judgment that was entered against you without your knowledge. There is a limited time available to do so, so you must keep in mind the dates.",
        "You need to file a motion to set aside the default judgment. If you are successful, they underlying case is reactivated and the creditor will need to serve you. Once you are served you will be able to assert any appropriate defenses and fight the lawsuit. Get an attorney to help you with this and act quickly before the garnishment goes through. The other options are 1) claim your exemptions against the garnishment - you have to do this within 10 days of receiving the notice, or 2) file bankruptcy if appropriate"

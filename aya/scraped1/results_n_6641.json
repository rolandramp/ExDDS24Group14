    "title": "In CA, how long can we stay legally separated & will it protect the assets once we agree to a marital separation of assets?",
    "question": "Once we come to an agreement on separation of assets, and **assuming** I can have mine retitled to my name alone, I would consider staying separated to keep him on my insurance. However, he is living a separate life that includes driving while intoxicated. My cash, IRAs, etc. total about 997K. As \"legally separated\" in CA 1) can I be held responsible in a lawsuit should be hurt/kill someone while DUI 2) am I responsible for his debts 3) can we (should we) re-title our home (e.g. TIC or Joint Tenancy) to protect my 50% until we can sell. He is arguing against immediate divorce but my primary concern is protecting my retirement.",

        "I agree with Attorney Kitta. Your situation is not simple. You may be able to achieve your objectives, but you are almost certainly going to need an attorney's assistance, to be sure it is done properly. Your situation is further complicated by the community property rules of your state. Here in Michigan, it would be relatively easily to segregate your assets and you would not be responsible for your husband's debts. But CA law may be entirely different and you need to work with an experienced estate planning attorney to handle this properly. You certainly do not want to re-title your assets without consulting an attorney, first.\n\nBest of luck to you!\n\nJames Frederick",
        "The complexity of your question really demands that you seek out legal counsel. First,in most individual' s minds that have not attended law school their definition and your definition of legal separation may be different than what the Courts consider to be a legal separation. There are different types of legal separation, one is you obtain a Judgment of legal separation instead of a Judgment of Dissolution of Marriage that has far different ramifications than what most people perceive to be a legal separation which would consist of not holding yourself out to be man and wife and not co-mingle or having joint accounts. I don't believe there are strict limitations on the duration of a legal separation. Unless you have the most unusual circumstances I imagine a number of your assets would be deemed to be community property which you still have ongoing potential liability for your ex's past and future malfeasance."

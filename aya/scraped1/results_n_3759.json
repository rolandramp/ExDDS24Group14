    "title": "S corporation and personal guarantees by a partner",
    "question": "I am partner in S corporation with less than 50% share. My partner wants to take up a business loan and to give his personal guarantees. If I don't sign the agreement but my partner does and gets the loan and something happens to him later will I be held responsible with my personal assets for this loan?",
    "answers": [
        "So long as your corporation is properly created and maintained and the shares properly issued, only the corporation and the guarantor would be liable on the loan.",
        "As the other attorney said, without a personal guarantee the lender cannot sue you for breaching the personal guarantee. However, there could be other issues that the lender could use to \"pierce the corporate veil\" and come after you down the road. You should spend the time with an experienced business attorney to get an opinion as to your personal liability for this business venture as a whole.",
        "If you do not sign the personal guarantee then you are not liable for the corporation's debts and the primary reason people form corporation's to shield them (personally) from company related debt. However, from a business perspective, are you in agreement as to the intended use of the loan proceeds for the business? Can the business cash flow support a loan? Is the loan going to also require a pledge of all the company assets to securitize the loan? If loan goes into default, how onerous are the default provisions and could you likely lose 100% of your business?",
        "If you don't sign a guaranty, then the lender can't enforce one against you. However, in my experience failing to sign one is the first step toward disaster amongst the directors\n\nThink long and hard"

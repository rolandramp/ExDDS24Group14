    "title": "Can I discharge a judgment in bankruptcy or do I have to get my insurance company to cover it?",
    "question": "My insurance denied coverage for a claim being made against my business. I think this was in bad faith. If my business gets sued and gets a judgment it against it, can I just discharge the debt in bankruptcy, or do I have to file a bad faith claim against the insurance carrier?",
    "answers": [
        "You should get good bankruptcy counsel because you may be able to discharge personal liability on the debt. However, (a) a personal bankruptcy wouldn't discharge any corporate liability and (b) some types of debts cannot be discharged. So you would need to have your attorney review the allegations to see if there are grounds to argue that the debt wouldn't be eliminated. Good luck and please do your careful research.",
        "Best advice is to consult with bankruptcy counsel to fully understand the options in that regard as to your business. There are many issues that come into whether a bankruptcy is a good solution.",
        "Depends on whether or not you have personal liability. You don't state if the debt is corporate debt or personal debt. A judgment can be discharged in a bankruptcy proceeding.",
        "Your personal bankruptcy can probably discharge your personal liability, but that will not remove any liability your business has if your business is anything other than a sole proprietorship. So, you may be able to discharge the debt, but your LLC or S corporation would still owe it. This would primarily be a problem if your business owns assets itself. Otherwise, you can always close down the current business and open a new one, but the new one cannot receive any assets from the old one without fair payment.",
        "Business bankrupty is different from personal bankruptcy. If you or your business suffers an adverse judgment, consult bankruptcy counsel. If you believe coverage was unreasonably withheld, consult bad faith counsel. You should not wait until you suffer an adverse judgment."

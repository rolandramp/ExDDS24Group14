    "title": "Can I be garnished for a 17 year old judgment?",
    "question": "I received a judgment for garnishment from our County Clerks office. The judgment is in my maiden name and is dated June 1998. After losing my mother to Leukemia 18 years ago I lost my home and excellent credit rating because I was taking care of her. At that time I was trying to sell my home but a credit card company put a lien on my home and I was unable to sell it but had to foreclose because I didn't have the funds to cover the lien. Now, 17 years later, I have a judgment to pay and will be getting garnished. The new judgment was signed Aug 2015. I no longer have any paperwork this far back and so I have not idea what my options are. I cannot remember if this was the credit card co. that had a lien on me. What are my options if any. Thank you",

        "There are several options. 1) you can pay the judgment. 2) you can try to negotiate with the creditor to try and pay a lower amount. They may take a lump sum of a lower amount and file a satisfaction of judgment. 3) you may be able to discharge this debt (and others) in a bankruptcy proceeding. 4) you could file a motion to make payments in installments. This may stop the interest from accruing on the debt. 5) you could do nothing and when the creditor takes steps to collect the debt defend or oppose their steps. For example, if they try and garnish your wages or levy your bank account you could file a claim of exemption.",
        "Yes. Based on information provided you may be garnished. California judgments are good for 10 years. They can be renewed indefinitely in 10 year increments. If judgment valid, you may be garnished.",
        "The creditor probably renewed the judgment and did an occasional investigation in to your current means of satisfying the judgment. When it discovered your employed, it proceeded with the garnishment. I see this with surprising frequency which can only mean that many people are simply hoping the lawsuits just go away. Unfortunately, as you're finding out, these judgments last a long time. You might want to consider filing bankruptcy, or posture that you'll file bankruptcy to settle the claim.",
        "In order to give you useful advise, it will be necessary to review the court documents. the paperwork you have should include a court case number. You should go to the courthouse and review the court's file. Makes copies of the most interesting documents, include any document of proof of service. Then consult an attorney.",
        "Unfortunately, the answer is, \"yes\". In California, a judgment can be renewed every 10 years (5 years, after the first renewal). As long as the judgment is active, the creditor can take any legally available action to enforce it, which includes wage garnishment, bank account levies, etc."

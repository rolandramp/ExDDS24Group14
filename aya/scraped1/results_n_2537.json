    "title": "How do I deal with new TAX debt while in a Chapter 13.",
    "question": "I am in a chapter 13 and estimated I have to pay the IRS $1700 and FTB $700 for 2014 return. Will I need to make separate arrangements with the IRS (and FTB or do I need to have the Trustee? If I need to make payments to IRS/FTB should I be able to have plan payment reduced? I got a refund last year and made less money this year,",
    "answers": [
        "You can either make arrangements to pay them directly or you can file a Motion to Modify your Plan to include that post-petition tax debt in your Chapter 13 plan which would raise your monthly plan payment to the trustee. Speak with your chapter 13 attorney and he/she should best advise you on which option is better for you.",
        "First, any post petition debts are yours to take care of and in fact your court order of confirmation or plan will provide for you NOT to incur any new indebtedness w/o a court order. As a result, you do need to make arrangements to pay with each agency owed. Secondly, I suggest you change the number of allowances on your paychecks then to decrease by one or so so more taxes are withdrawn and you don't have to deal with this next year.\n\nSecond, a person can attempt to file a motion to modify a plan and then you must comply with all the rules governing it. As of 12-1-14 in our jurisdiction it means complying with new rules too. But amended Schedules I , J, and notice and motion and order and amended plan are required. Your attorney fees might be almost close to the actual taxes are owed too if in fact someone contests it too. Thus, you might just make payments now, and decrease allowances and if next year you get a refund the IRS will offset against the $ owed for 2014 too! Good luck.",
        "This is a question for your own BK atty. If you don't have one, get one. The 2014 tax debt is \"post-petition\" meaning it was not provided for in your Plan. You can make payment arrangements with the IRS/FTB and incorporate those payments as part of a Motion to Modify your Plan with the different budget based on the \"new\" debt. If, during your Plan, you get a tax refund, that will have to be paid to the trustee so it is best to closely monitor your exemptions with your employer so as to minimize (eliminate) any refund."

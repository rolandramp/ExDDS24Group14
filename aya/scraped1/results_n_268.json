    "title": "Creditor in a bankruptcy case?",
    "question": "I was a creditor in a bankruptcy case. The debtor took $200,000 from me on the basis that he will be paying me interest on it. He did however send me $40,000 and now the trustee's lawyer is contacting me and asking me for $60,000 back or they will file a complaint. It doesn't make sense that they are asking a creditor for money, especially considering I only got $40,000 of the $200,000 that the debtor took. I showed be owed money not taken from. I am a 51 year old, I work as a cashier in a gas station and I have 2 kids in college. I don’t have that money and the trustees lawyer told me “I know you can’t pay with your current income so you should refinance your home” What can I do?",

However, there are several defenses to such a preference action and you need to seek legal counsel to respond to the complaint before you lose the right to do so and suffer a default judgment being entered against you. Be sure that the attorney you consult with/retain has had EXPERIENCE in bankruptcy litigation/defending preference actions and does not just advertise that they \"litigate.\"",

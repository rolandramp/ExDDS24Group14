    "title": "Can I unilaterally fire my bankruptcy attorney in a joint Chapter 13? Or does my wife have to agree to fire the attorney too?",
    "question": "My wife and I are in the middle the divorce process, and we are not seeing eye-to-eye on much. I feel that our bankruptcy attorney cannot possibly represent us properly because of the differences in opinion between my wife and I. The attorney has not been responsive to questions, and was quick to sign off on a relief from automatic stay that I did not want granted (there is no money in the house), but my wife wanted granted. Can I fire the attorney without my wife's consent?",
    "answers": [
        "This will cost a pretty penny. Unless you have been in chapter 13 a long time, things are going to get worse before the get better. I would considered either splitting up the case or dismissing and refiling. Hope this perspective helps.",
        "The best way to accomplish this is to hire your own attorney, and your present attorney would then execute a substitution of attorney. Your wife will not have to be involved. She will continue to be represented by your present attorney if she so chooses.",
        "You should certainly pursue hiring another attorney. You are correct that you and your wife now have opposed interests, and it is your right to fire your current Chapter 13 attorney.",
        "You should bifurcate your case if you are not on the same page. Go see an experienced bankruptcy attorney in your area to review and discuss your case and the implications if you separated out the cases.",
        "I believe no attorney in a ch 13 that was joint and now the couple are divorcing can proceed to represent both of you without violating the law on conflicts of interest and possible conflicts of interest. To try and explain to you all those possibilities and then obtain your waiver I would be about impossible. However, If one of you is going to pay 100% of all the debts and continues to, then the other spouse might obtain a new counsel but then just sit back and watch..but I would simply go employ a new attorney and obtain their advice on what to do...not focus on \"firing\" an attorney. That attorney's job may possibly already be over as far as the terms of their contract too. Obtain a new attorneys advice and don't tell your ex yet and then follow their advice..or obtain another attorneys advice too and compare! Good luck. I hope I have helped you.",
        "Yes, you can. You're also welcome to get another attorney to represent your interests alone. In fact, if there is a conflict of interest between you and your wife in the bankruptcy, the attorney is or may be in the future conflicted out from representing either you or your wife. Do be aware, however, that moves like these could well jeopardize the success of your Chapter 13 by adding significant administrative expenses. If you feel that your interests are not being represented, and your current attorney is not being responsive, however, it would certainly not be a bad idea to sit down for a consultation with another attorney that can look at all the facts and tell you your options. Best of luck to you.",
        "When a couple separates or files for a divorce, a conflict is created for your attorney. The attorney should either withdraw as yours and your wife's attorney or have you executed a conflict waiver. If you want another attorney, you can certainly hire one. If you don't think it is in your best interests to sign a conflicts waiver so you wife can stay with the current attorney, she will have to find another attorney as well. Both of you will have to pay for the new attorneys."

    "title": "Chapter 7 bankruptcy 2 years ago. If I reopen case to file a motion to avoid judgment lien on home, they look @ value now?then?",
    "question": "I wondering, if a case is reopened due to an abstract of judgment on a home that needs to be \"avoided\", will the judge or trustee look at today's value or the value it had when I filed my petition 2 years ago? how can I be sure? If they look at the old value, would I have to somehow prove that up? how? At the time I had 25k in equity which we exempted. Now I have 125k.",

        "Property acquired after the filing of the bankruptcy is not property of the bankruptcy estate, and the date for determining which value to use is the filing date of the original petition. However, you should definitely consult with an experienced local bankruptcy attorney in your area to factor in the effect of local rules and decisions in prior cases in your jurisdiction. You would, in the face of an objection to your motion to avoid lien, need to provide sufficient proof of what the value was at the time of filing, and that the equity in your home was less than the allowed homestead exemption in your jurisdiciton. It appears there has been a dramatic uptick in the real estate market in your area and this could generate a great deal of interest in the true value, which may or may not be the value you placed on the property in your original bankruptcy schedules. You are asking very specific legal questions that truly need the attention of a qualified bankruptcy attorney in your area. Please find an attorney you can place your confidence in to assist you.

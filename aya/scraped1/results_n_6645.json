        "Find out as much identifying information about the caller as you can. Name, legal name, real address, fax number and phone number. Ask for the name of the original creditor. Ask whether they have a judgment.\n\nDo not, DO NOT, make any promise to pay or to send them any money. If you do, you will re-start the Statute of Limitations all over again.\n\nAfter you get the information, you may wish to consult an attorney, as you may have a lawsuit for violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. If you have a good lawsuit, you can collect actual damages, a statutory penalty of up to $1,000 per violation, and attorney's fees.\n\nThe \"court number\" in your inquiry appears to be too long to be a case number assigned by a court. The 1-877 appears as though it is someone's telephone number.",
        "While I cannot give you legal advice in this forum, as a general matter you should first demand proof of the debt as being owed by you. Do not answer questions. Do not give them any information. Do not make any payments. If they send you proof of the debt, spend a little money to hire a local attorney to advise you on your defenses and whether you should pay. However, I cannot think of a situation in which a 22 year old debt is sill collectable, but you never know.",
        "Do not send money. Simply demand written proof of the debt. I predict it will not be forthcoming, but the verbal threats will ratchet up.\n\nYour description if strongly suspicious for a scam. There is, quite unfortunately, a great deal this activity: somewhat official sounding demands for payment of old debts. Payday loans and court fines are common claims. To test my hypothesis, just google the number. The scam is well known.\n\nMy Avvo colleagues will be hasty to point out that collection agents making false claims are violating the federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, and this is entirely true. The FDCPA successfully controls real collection agents but the scammers are typically offshore and beyond the reach of our justice system.\n\nBest wishes for a favorable outcome, and please remember to designate a best answser."

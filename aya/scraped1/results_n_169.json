    "title": "Bankruptcy while still in the divorce process?",
    "question": "My soon-to-be ex has filed Chapter 7 BK, does he have to provide me with a list of the creditors he's bankrupting especially if most he's bankrupting hold both my name as well as his? I have asked and he refuses to provide it. And does the party filing BK have to file something with the family court?",
    "answers": [
        "When you say your soon to be ex has not provided anything,\nSounds like there is a divorce pending, why not have your divorce\nattorney get the information for you. If you are NOT in a divorce\nyou can always get the bankruptcy information from the Bankruptcy Court",
        "As already provided, PACER is the resource for viewing the bankruptcy case and seeing the list of creditors. How far along is your divorce? Has there been a division of property and discussion or resolution regarding debt. Unfortunately, even if you have entered into some agreement with your ex about the debt - for instance that he would pay some of the debt - the creditors are not part of that agreement and are not bound by it. Since you are not a party to the bankruptcy, the creditors will look to yo for payment. Did you get notice of the bankruptcy? You should have been listed as a creditor as well. I urge you to seek advice from your family attorney about options and most important, talk with an experienced bankruptcy attorney regarding issues and options regarding the community debt. Some of us offer a half hour no charge consult - to get preliminary information.",
        "No one has to do anything unless there is a legal obligation that they do so. If you have a court order saying your ex must do this, take this to the judge and enforce it. On the other hand, if you want a copy of a public record, you can order it without question and pay the modest cost for the copies. Hope this perspective helps!",
        "As suggested by my colleague, create an account on PACER, then you can examine each and every document in his BK filing. You can also find/consult/hire a lawyer in your area using the Avvo feature \"Find a Lawyer\". Make a list of 4-5 having many 5 star reviews from satisfied clients. If you don't get a prompt call back from one, go on to the next on your list. Some offer a free consultation by phone or in person. They can access PACER more quickly because they already have access to it. Good luck & God bless.",
        "If he is refusing to provide you a list of his creditors you can look them up on PACER for free. You just need to create an account, search for his case by name or social security number and download his petition. The bankruptcy petition requires a list of his creditors be attached.\n\nAs for your family court question, the Court should probably be noticed that one of the parties is in an active bankruptcy case. Talk to your family lawyer about that.\n\nI hope this helps."

        "Atty Heston is right. Bankruptcy may be what you need to solve your debt problem. Remember, BK is more than checking boxes on forms you find online. Find/consult/hire a lawyer using the Avvo feature \"Find a Lawyer\". Make a list of 4-5 having many 5 star reviews from satisfied clients. If you don't get a prompt call back from one, go on to the next on your list. Some of us offer a free consultation by phone or in person. Take us up on it.\n\nBecause the bankruptcy process can be handled entirely by phone, email and fax, there is no need to personally visit the lawyer’s office unless you want to. Don’t be limited by the location of the BK lawyers you select.",
        "Regrettably, in a trend which has swept the country in recent years, many counties in California have turned to private debt collection services in their efforts to collect unpaid fines for traffic infractions. While California no longer suspends drivers licenses due to unpaid traffic tickets, the private agencies bring lawsuits on the unpaid fines and then use the wage garnishment laws to enforce the civil judgments. Federal law limits wage garnishment to 25% of your net earnings, and if you still experience a hardship you can request that the court reduce that percentage to a lesser amount.\n\nBut to stop the garnishment completely, short of paying the civil judgment, you may have to invoke the bankruptcy laws to protect you. Especially if you have other unpaid debts outstanding, such as old bills, credit card accounts and the like, you may wish to consider bankruptcy as an effective tool to wipe the slate clean and start over fresh."

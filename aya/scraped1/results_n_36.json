        "Child support is not dischargeable, so filing a bankruptcy with your facts is unlikely to help your situation. I would suggest you talk to a family law attorney--a free or reduced fee clinic might help you obtain relief.",
        "Basically, you have two choices when it comes to filing personal bankruptcy: Chapter 7 or Chapter 13. Chapter 13 is not a likely option because you have to show you have a steady income sufficient to result in presenting a \"feasible\" plan to the court. Chapter 7 is better suited to your situation, but there is an express presumption that you cannot discharge \"Child/spousal support\" debts.\n\nAs to the levy on a overdrawn bank account, obviously no money will be recovered. The sheriff will return the writ to the court after the bank reports it has no funds to pay over. Why does the DMV have a hold on your driver's license? Usually, driving w/o insurance, having an accident w/o insurance or a DUI conviction results in suspension of your license.",
        "Ufortunatelyfor you, child support cannot be wiped out in bankruptcy."

    "title": "Filed chapter 7 bankruptcy right after CA FTB sent notice 2 wage garnish me. 3 days after filed, garnish my check. Wont return $",
    "question": "Okay, so here is basically the deal. On monday, I get notice from my employer that the CA franchise tax board will be garnishing my next check on Friday due to old tax liabilities. By Wed of that same week I filed a chapter 7 bankruptcy (was planning to do so anyway for credit card debt); They took the money from my check b/c my employer cuts checks several days prior. At first, the FTB was saying it might take 40 days to get my money back. Remember, I filed BK before I was issued the garnished check. When I called to check on it the other day, the FTB said \"No, we are keeping that money and are allowed to do so because we sent notice to garnish to your employer before you filed\".",
    "answers": [
        "If you filed your bankruptcy prior to the garnishment, the automatic stay prohibited FTB from taking the money, and if they refuse to give it back they are in continued willful violation of the automatic stay. For starters, amend your Schedules B and C to include the money taken by the FTB as an asset and then exempt that asset. After that, you’ll have to file a turnover motion or an action for violation of the automatic stay (done via motion normally in CDCA). The process may be long, but it is important to be persistent and I would recommend that you retain counsel to represent you in your Ch. 7 bankruptcy case. Consult with an attorney or visit www.dattalawgroup.com for more information.",
        "I agree with colleagues. What happened to you is fairly common in Los Angeles. Money taken before you filed BL can be recovered if it had not been turned over to creditor. Monet taken after BK filed can also be recovered. Contact creditor and Sheriff office and produce copy of notice of filing and demand return of payment. Either or both may be reluctant to cooperate with you. Be persistent. Hire BK counsel if necessary.",
        "IF you have room, you might possibly want to file an amended Schedule B to list the garnished monies if they are exemptable in full in Schedule C also. You can file an amendment. Seems like you should not have to but if fully exempt I do not see how it will hurt either.",
        "If you filed your bankruptcy prior to the garnishment, the automatic stay prohibited FTB from taking the money, and if they refuse to give it back they are in continued willful violation of the automatic stay. That's the good news. There are two sides to the bad news. First, the only way to force them to give you the money back, if they won't work with you, is to file an adversary proceeding against them. If you can prove they are willfully violating the stay, you may be eligible to recover punitive damages and attorney's fees, but the process takes time. The second part of the bad news is that, if it is priority debt, you'll have to pay that money to the FTB anyway after the bankruptcy (though if it is old tax debt, you may not). Hope that helps; best of luck to you.",
        "The Ch. 7 trustee has standing to sue to set aside the garnishment as a preferential transfer during the presumed insolvency period.\n\nTherefore, the trustee would be the one to file an adversary proceeding for turnover of your funds.\n\nIf not, you will have to file a motion for turnover or an adversary proceeding (depending on whether this is an asset or no asset case, and whether the FTB files a proof of claim), if the trustee chooses to abandon the funds.\n\nI would suggest that you retain counsel to represent you in your Ch. 7 bankruptcy case.

        "I'm not sure how things work in California, but you would get that money back in my district in Florida. Have you had your 341 Meeting of Creditors yet? Tell the trustee at the 341 about the problem and see if he or she will help out. Good luck!"

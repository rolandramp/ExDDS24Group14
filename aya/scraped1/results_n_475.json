    "question": "I owe about $80,000 in credit card debt from 10 years ago. How much can a lawyer get them reduced or is it better to file Chapter 7?",
    "answers": [
        "Depending on when you quit paying, it is very possible that you do not even need a bankruptcy and that you do not even need to pay any settlements. See a BK lawyer in person.",
        "Settlement can run as little as 10% or as high as 100% if creditor is uncooperative. It happens sometimes. Many debts may be settled for 30 to 60%. Whether bankruptcy is a good solution requires more facts about you, something you will want to discuss privately with an attorney. Written contract breach in CA has a 4 year statute limitation. Has the debt been reduced to a judgment before SOL expired? If so, has judgment attached to assets? Get a consult to discuss these and other pertinents facts.",
        "If the debt is from ten years ago, the statute of limitations has run if the creditors haven't already gotten a judgment against you and it should have fallen off your credit report. I suggest that you consult with a bankruptcy attorney who will pull your credit report and run a judgment check.",
        "Remember bankruptcy is a solution, debt settlement is a scam. To properly answer your questions and address your concerns, the best way to handle this is with an in person consultation with an experienced CA bankruptcy attorney. Use AVVO's Find a Lawyer tool to select a qualified attorney. Good luck. THIS IS NOT LEGAL ADVICE! YOU NEED TO SPEAK TO AN ATTORNEY WHO IS LICENSED IN YOUR STATE FOR LEGAL ADVICE. This is merely suggestions for you to think about in discussing your situation with the local attorney.",
        "Impossible to say without reviewing your financial affairs. You would 1st have to determine if you are eligible for chapter 7. You would then compare that to what you would receive through an attorney negotiated settlement."

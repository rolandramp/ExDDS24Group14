    "title": "I’m being sued by Chase Bank. Midland Funding LLC has taken over the suit. It is for about $9,000.",
    "question": "I have been on permanent disability for two years now and can’t afford to pay them. They want nearly $7,000 cash or a down payment of $1,000 and payments of $240 a month for 80 months. I can’t afford it. I have almost lost my home to Chase Bank. I’m underwater by $100,000 and paid the other cards I had off, but by settling with them for this one, I ran out of money.",

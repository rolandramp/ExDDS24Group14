    "question": "Hi, My mom had to undergo surgery on one of her trips. She is a self-sponsored visitor to USA on a tourist visa. And has over 300K in medical debt now as Visitor insurance did not pay the hospital. I would now want to file immigrant petition for her but obviously wouldn't want to assume her current debt. Should see file bankruptcy before immigrant petition can be started? or they both can be started simultanously? or No bankruptcy needed? I would still want her to start with a clean slate and work on getting a life after years of financial and familial hard ship, greif and loss of husband.",

        "Your mother is not eligible for either bankruptcy or immigration, since she would become a public charge. To properly answer your questions and address your concerns, the best way to handle this is with an in person consultation with an experienced CA bankruptcy and immigration attorney. Use AVVO's Find a Lawyer tool to select a qualified attorney. Good luck. THIS IS NOT LEGAL ADVICE! YOU NEED TO SPEAK TO AN ATTORNEY WHO IS LICENSED IN YOUR STATE FOR LEGAL ADVICE. This is merely suggestions for you to think about in discussing your situation with the local attorney.",
        "I agree that you will need an attorney to represent Mom on any immigrant petition, especially if she received medical care at a publicly funded hospital. Bankruptcy or not, Mom is likely to be excluded from the US immigration programs if she is \"likely to become a public charge\" and a large bill to a public hospital is what that phrase entails. Hope this perspective helps!"

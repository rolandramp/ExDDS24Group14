    "title": "In my divorce settlement, I owe my spouse stock. She owes me cash. How do I ensure I get my cash?",
    "question": "Let's say I owe my wife a lot of stock and the current value of the stock is $100,000. Let's say she owes me $25,000 in cash but she is broke and doesn't have any money. What's my best option? I don't want to sell the stock under my name, because then I incur a large tax burden. If I transfer the stock to her, I doubt I will ever see the cash. What can I ask the court to do to ensure I get what's due me?",
    "answers": [
        "You would fall back upon the language of your divorce/separation agreement, if she fails to pay you, then you would file a complaint for contempt. Most likely you can also try and negotiate with her and see if she will agree to a cash/stock transaction that protects both of you such as you pay her x percentage less and call it even, however you must have that in writing and you may need it approved by the court, chat with local counsel it is worth the legal feees to save a few thousand in expenses, taxes and headaches in court. take care.",
        "\"Not all dollars are equal\". This is a quote from a financial specialist with whom I work and lecture in community workshops called \"Divorce Options: everything you need to know about divorce\". What she means by this is that some dollars are tied up in deferred tax situations, some have a significant future value but a low present value, and so on. So when thinking about equalization, offsets, etc, you really need to examine the costs/benefits of how you structure the deal.\n\nThe court is REQUIRED to follow current case law and statutes - nothing fancy, nothing creative, in short, often, nothing that makes sense for your individual goals and situation. It's a cookie cutter formula. And it is unreasonable to expect a Judge to be fully knowledgeable in how to create an allocation of assets and debts that not only puts you both in a better (or less worse) financial situation, but also limits your tax consequences - they are not financial or tax specialists (typically). So my best recommendation to you would be to contact a financial specialist well versed in divorce (perhaps a certified divorce financial analyst) who can best guide you.\n\nAgain, you can ask the court for anything you want, but the court MUST apply applicable case law based on the evidence presented, which may or may not be to your benefit.\n\nI hope this information is helpful. I have included some links below to assist you in your search for a financial specialist experienced in divorce matters. Good luck.",
        "The simplest solution probably would be just to give her $75,000 worth of the stock, withhold $25,000 until such time as she pays you the cash she owe you. At that point, she probably will be agreeable to an offset.\nI hope this is helpful.\n\nJohn N. Kitta\nFremont",
        "I concur with Mr. Lewis' response except that you can't get someone held in contempt in California for a non-support obligation. If the settlement has not yet been signed or reduced to judgment, you should endeavor to negotiate a set-off on the stock that you are transferring to your wife, taking into consideration that you should receive more than a $25,000 stock set-off because you will incur a tax liability selling the stock, whereas the $25,000 that you are supposed to receive is after-tax money. If Judgment has already been entered, you should try to negotiate a similar deal, but it should be memorialized in a Stip;ulation and Order Modifying Judgment. You would best retain if not consult an experienced Family Law Attorney to resolve the situation, if you are not now represented."

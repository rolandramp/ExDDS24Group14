    "title": "California - credit card debt to surviving husband",
    "question": "My mom had a credit card in her name only. My dad did not sign the application, and was not an authorized user. She let her son use the card, and he paid his own bills (and other stuff) on that card, and the balance at the time of mother's passing was about $7000.00. There is no trust, and no will. My dad does not have any real assets to mention. Will he still be liable for the entire debt or can he explain this to the credit card company?",
    "answers": [
        "California's community property law would make any community property liable for the credit card debt, not him.\n\nSo you have to look at what is community property, and what's not. In all likelihood the creditor will not do much about this.",
        "As an initial matter, I am sorry that the first three \"answers\" that you received contain no useful information. This is a direct result of the way in which Avvo incentives attorneys to answer questions with \"contributor points.\" Many attorneys rush give lame answers just to get points for their profile. The first three responses are awarded points, regardless of the substance of the response, and any subsequent response is awarded no contributor points. Thus, the \"Contributor level\" shown on Avvo profiles is no indication of the quality of the answers provided, just the speed at which something (anything) is posted in response. Now for your question.\n\nThe short answer is yes, your father is responsible for your mother's credit card debt, but only for one year from the date of your mother's death. This assumes that your parents did not have a prenuptial or post-nuptial agreement regarding California's community property laws. Two California statutes get you there.\n\nFirst, California Family Code ยง 910(a) provides that, \"Except as otherwise expressly provided by statute, the community estate is liable for a debt incurred by either spouse before or during marriage, regardless of which spouse has the management and control of the property and regardless of whether one or both spouses are parties to the debt or to a judgment for the debt.\" Thus, the \"marital community\" (i.e. any money or property acquired by your parents during their marriage) is liable for your mother's debts, even after her death.\n\nSecondly, California Code of Civil Procedure ยง 366.2(a) provides that, \"If a person against whom an action may be brought on a liability of the person, whether arising in contract, tort, or otherwise, and whether accrued or not accrued, dies before the expiration of the applicable limitations period, and the cause of action survives, an action may be commenced within one year after the date of death, and the limitations period that would have been applicable does not apply.\" Thus, the statute of limitations for filing a lawsuit against your father for your mother's credit card debts is one year from the date of her death, without regard to whether or not the creditors have knowledge of her death.\n\nBased on these statutes, I would recommend that your father does nothing and simply waits to see if one or more of your mother's creditors step up and file a lawsuit against him to collect. If that happens, your father should consult with an experienced collection defense attorney immediately. In the interim, your father should not pay any of your mother's debts, nor should he speak with any of her creditors on the telephone. There is simply no benefit for your father in paying or trying to \"explain the situation\" to your mother's creditors. If your father makes it a year without being sued, he could then start telling your mother's creditors that they are SOL (Sh*t Out of Luck) due to the SOL (Statute Of Limitations). See, Collection Bureau of San Jose v. Rumsey, 24 Cal. 4th 301 (Cal. 2000) (\"because plaintiff collection agency had failed to file suit within one year of the death of the debtor spouse, its suit against the surviving spouse for recovery of the expenses of the debtor spouse's last illness was barred by the limitations period of Code of Civil Procedure former section 353 [now section 366.2].\").\n\nFinally, opinions are like belly buttons, everyone has one, and attorneys on Avvo are no different. Therefore, you should not rely solely on the opinions of attorneys on Avvo or any other website. I have provided you with what I believe are the relevant California statutes and a citation to the leading California Supreme Court case on this subject. However, you should do your own research and ask other attorneys who have experience defending debt collection lawsuit until you feel comfortable with the responses you have received.\n\nI am sorry to hear of your family's loss and I hope that I have helped you in some small way.",
        "This is debt settlement. But you got good answers.",
        "Your father will not be liable for a debt that he did not co-sign. Sorry to hear about your loss.\nGood luck with your case!",
        "The debt collection will probably attempt to collect from your father. They have special scripts that they use when contacting family members after the death of the account holder. My advise is to not talk with the debt collectors. There is no legal liability on the part of someone who was not an account holder. The creditor is limited to suing the estate of the deceased. If there is no estate, and no probate, the creditor has no legal right to collect from anyone else"

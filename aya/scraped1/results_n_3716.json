    "title": "As an individual with about 12000 debt. what chapter bankruptcy would I consider filing for?",
    "question": "I have a little over 11000 debt and I cannot afford to pay it now and think it is best to file for bankruptcy. What is the type of bankruptcy I should consider filing for (Chapter-7?)",
    "answers": [
        "You would consider both chapter 7 & chapter 13 bankruptcy, then decide; both are a means to an end: relief from debt. The individual chapters constitute different strategies to achieve that goal. If combating debt is a battlefield, then consider the respective chapters choices in weaponry.",
        "In order to make that determination, we consider not only debt, but income, expenses and assetts as well.",
        "You only have 2 goals really when filing: (1) to keep all your assets and (2) to discharge your debts. As a result, meet with an attorney who only practices bankruptcy law and he or she can advise you of whether you can achieve those 2 goals. But there are other issues that an attorney will ask you about as your answers can affect our advise to you. For example, if you paid back your mom $3000 11 months ago and file bankruptcy this week, the trustee will sue your mom under what is called a preference claim. That is but one example. So employ and attorney, start fresh and move on..but have it done right!",
        "Probably a 7, maybe a 13. You need to sit down with an experienced bankruptcy attorney to discuss your case. There are a number of factors which will need to be analyzed. MOot bankruptcy attorneys offer free initial consults and payment plans. Good luck to you.",
        "Good question. There are so many factors to consider when considering to file bankruptcy. You'll need to talk with a lawyer to help you understand what it all means. You're doing great to reach out for help already, now continue to be your own best advocate and set up a consultation or 2-3.\n\nEssentially, filing for bankruptcy protection and relief revolves around disclosing your past financial dealings, income, assets, sales/transfers and financial obligations (aka debt). $11,000 in debt may be a small amount compared to your ability to recover in 2-3 years, possibly, or it may be overly burdensome in the short-term AND the long-term. It is for you to decide if filing bankruptcy will make more sense than to attempt to ride it out and pay down/settle these debts. And with the help of an experienced lawyer who will take their time with you to give you the information you need, the decision about whether to file bankruptcy will be that much easier to make.\n\nBottom line: get a better feel for bankruptcy's possible role in your life by talking with a few bankruptcy lawyers ... you may find that you have received a great deal of help after only a call or two.",
        "I agree with Attorney Larkin's answer but based on the amount of debt I would assume you don't have much in the way of assets or a high salary so 7 would be your best bet.",
        "I wouldn't recommend bankruptcy for someone with only this amount of debt. Bankruptcy is your lifeline & should be reserved for when your debt is overwhelming. You only have the opportunity to obtain a bankruptcy discharge once every 8 years. There are other options that may be available to help you to resolve your debt problem. The problem with filing bankruptcy when you have a smaller amount of debt is that you have to overcome the obstacle of passing a \"good faith\" test which isn't always on the radar of people considering bankruptcy without a competent attorney to guide them.

        "The answer depends on many factors, including what assets you own, what your income is, and whether you have filed a previous Chapter 7 in the past 8 years. Get a consultation with a local bankruptcy attorney who can advise you how best to proceed.",
        "What type do you qualify for? That is something that requires many more details than just picking the \"best\" type (if you even should file at all).

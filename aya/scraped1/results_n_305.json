    "title": "Can I file a partition to protect my interest in our property during my spouses' bankruptcy?",
    "question": "My husband has credit card creditors after him with one judgment lien filed on our property already. Can I file a partition or what types of legal vehicles can I use to protect my half interest in our property? how about if my spouse files chapter 7 or 13 bankruptcy with a partition on my behalf in place to protect my half interest? Will the courts only consider half of the equity in bankruptcy? and can he still use and apply for the homestead exemption on his half of the property? Thank you",

If that does not work for you, then seek the assistance of your own bankruptcy attorney. You really need to have a good handle on all his debts and other liabilities.

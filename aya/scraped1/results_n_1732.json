    "question": "My wages are being garnished by the IRS already",
    "answers": [
        "I believe that both can garnish at the same time. However, there is a cap of the total that can be taken from your individual checks. It sounds like you need to file a claim of exemption in, at a minimum, the second case.",
        "It depends. You need to consult a bankruptcy attorney.",
        "Yes. You can file a Claim of Exemption, asking that the amount of the garnishments be reduced because of your financial circumstances.",
        "Yes and No.\nYes. Both creditors may file garnishments order.\nNo. Both creditors may not garnish simultaneously. Only one creditor at at time. Second creditor to file must wait until first creditor garnishments has been fully satisfied. Second creditor garnishment will automatically begin after first creditor debt satisfied.\nGarnishment subject to limits and worker rights:\nOnly a Certain Amount of Work income may be Garnished: Under the Consumer Credit Protection Act (CCPA), a garnishment sought in federal court may not exceed 25 percent of the debtor's disposable earnings each week.\nException for Child Support: If garnishment for back payment of child support it could be as high as 60 percent of disposable income.\nMinimum Wage Limitation: Court order could garnish the amount by which the debtor's disposable earnings for the week exceed thirty times the federal minimum wage -- whichever is lower. Disposable income means all of your income, even if it's from multiple jobs, with the required tax deductions subtracted. Other payments that are necessary to your daily life, such as rent, food, and health insurance, are not included in this calculation.\nLimited Job Protection: Federal law protects you from being fired simply because your wages are being garnished for a single debt. However, if your wages are being garnished for two or more debts, your employer can fire you if it decides to do so.",
        "Sounds like you need to talk to a bankruptcy lawyer."

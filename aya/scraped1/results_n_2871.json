    "title": "Does a \"catch-all\" clause in a trust allow a named beneficiary to withdraw money (probate free) from a bank account not listed?",
    "question": "Does a \"catch-all\" clause in a trust that says all property not listed in schedule of assets is still part of the trust allow a named beneficiary in said trust to withdraw money (directly, avoiding probate) from a bank account not specifically listed in the trust? I cannot find any cases or law that deal with this issue, but I don't see why it wouldn't be allowed. NOTE: I am not interested in pour over wills or anything besides the very specific scenario I described. Pour over wills do not avoid probate and the whole point of my question is to see if probate can be avoided. Please point me to some of the California law or Restatement 3rd of Trusts sections that deal with this, I cannot find anything!",

        "No. \"Catch-all\" provision by itself does not allow beneficiary to withdraw money from a bank account. Depending on facts of this matter, Heggsted petition or affidavit may be necessary.",
        "I assume the bank account is solely in the name of the Grantor. If so, the beneficiaries may be able to agree via affidavit to legally have the account brought under the trust. If not, then a Heggstad Petition must be filed with the court.

That would change things.",
        "Im assuming you meant the settlor/trustor's name not trustee (the may have been the same). No, there is no right to access and withdraw from the account if it was in the decedent's name alone. The \"catch all\" you are referring to sounds like an assignment to the trust. That is usually referenced in the trust as I have transferred the assets listed on Schedule A to the Trustee. That creates what is known as an express trust. Court is still required to get the bank to change title under a Heggsted Petition. That said, if the total about outside the trust is less than $150,000, the Trustee (assuming there is a pour-over will which you didn't want to discuss) could use a 13100 Affidavit to pull the assets into the trust.\n\nIf the Trustee has died and there is no successor trustee, you need to Petition the Court of appointment of successor trustee unless the court has an alternate mechanism to do so.\n\nIf you are spending money of the trust or the decedent's estate without authority, even if you are the only beneficiary, you could have liability to creditor's including the IRS. Be careful and good luck.",
        "\"Does a \"catch-all\" clause in a trust allow a named beneficiary to withdraw money (probate free) from a bank account not listed?\" -- No. The trustee (or all beneficiaries) may be able to have the account transferred outside probate via affidavit. Otherwise, approval of a Heggstad petition by the court would be required to bring the account into the trust."

        "Yes, you may be responsible to pay these debts back. You do not mention the amount of these debts and/or when they were incurred. If you feel overwhelmed with the calls and the debt you may find relief in just discussing your situation with an experienced bankruptcy attorney. As mentioned above just because you speak with a bankruptcy attorney does not mean you should file bankruptcy. There may be alternative available to you. But, you do not know what you do not know and thus I suggest you consult with an experienced bankruptcy attorney to know your bankruptcy and non-bankruptcy options. Most of us offer free consultations. Take us up on the free advice.",
        "Ms. Doling and Mr, Markus provide good advice. Usually what seems like a simple question leads to more questions to be answered. There are circumstances where your assets and income may be protected from creditor claims even if you are legally responsible. You can find out if you are willing and able to provide more detail to a competent attorney.",
        "As Ms. Doling stated, community assets are liable for the debts of the marital community, so you are responsible for medical debts incurred by your spouse during your marriage. Whether this extends to post-mortem income you earn, I'm not sure of.\n\nIf the debt is more than you can handle, bankruptcy may indeed be an easy resolution for you. To learn the pros and cons and your options, contact a bankruptcy attorney such as myself for a consultation.",
        "Short answer - In California, yes. Did your husband have an estate? If so, creditors may file claims to be paid out of the his estate. You can also return the bills marked \"deceased\" and see if they stop bothering you. Your best move would be to meet with a qualified bankruptcy attorney to get advice. Bankruptcy attorneys are familiar with these situations and can explain your options, which may not be a recommendation to file for bankruptcy. Many people don't realize that just because you explore bankruptcy options does not mean you must file. The attorney should be able to provide you with both bankruptcy and non-bankruptcy options. Most of us provide a free consultation. You are located in the Central District of California. Therefore, don't limit your search for a good bankruptcy attorney to just your town. You want someone qualified and reputable and you want to meet the attorney you hire."

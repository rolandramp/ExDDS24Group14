        "Under a special power of attorney, your brother is called the principal, and you are his agent. You will have certain powers, which should be listed in the POA with specificity. You will be empowered to handle certain financial transactions, such as closing a bank account, on your brother's behalf. If your brother is later sued, you will not be able to represent him in court, so you do not need to worry about that.",
        "Hello,\n\nIn addition, since you will be his agent and follow the terms of the POA, you should not be personally liable for his debts.\n\nIt is recommended that you consult with an attorney to insure that the POA is done correctly.",
        "You ensure this by getting a Special Power of Attorney (which defines the limits of the powers granted) not a General Power of Attorney. Neither one allows you to represent him in court - that for attorneys, not individuals under a power of attorney.",
        "You don't have to do anything you do want to. Consult with an attorney and get specific wording in the document. Also, make sure you have someone as a back-up on the document, just in case. Good luck to you!",
        "You can specify that your POA is a limited POA only for the purpose of taking care of his bank accounts. You should consult with an attorney before attempting this on your own."

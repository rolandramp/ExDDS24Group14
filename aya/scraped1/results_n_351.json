    "title": "I lost my unlawful detainer case but can't pay the judgment, what can I do?",
    "question": "This is a business lease, business went bad and I was evicted with an unlawful detainer in the Los Angeles area. I moved out and ultimately lost the judgment for $25,000. Way more than I owed, but that was what the judgment was. I have moved out of the state, but I can't pay the rent. Also, this was for a business but the lease was under my personal name, not the business or business tax ID.",
    "answers": [
        "Personally guaranteeing a business lease is very common. Speak to a local BK attorney about your debts, assets, income. They should be able to ask pertinent questioms and advise you if filing will meet your goals.",
        "Bankruptcy may be a very good option for you, and if your business debt is more than half your consumer debt then you can dispel with the means test. I suggest that you use AVVO to find one or two bankruptcy attorneys in your area and take advantage of a free consult if they offer it.",
        "Even if you move out of state, they can try to get your current state to recognize the judgment and continue with collection efforts in that state as permitted by that state's laws.\n\nBankruptcy, if you qualify and is a good fit for you, can discharge your personal obligation for this type of judgment."

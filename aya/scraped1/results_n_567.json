        "You need to call some experienced bankruptcy attorneys right away for a consultation. You can likely re-file a chapter 13 to stop the sale date. There are various options regarding your chapter 13 plan as the arrears are likely very high if you have not paid the mortgage for 9 years.",
        "Possibly. Consult with some real estate attorneys to review all documents and communications. If you have been living mortgage free for nine years it sounds like you can afford an attorney."

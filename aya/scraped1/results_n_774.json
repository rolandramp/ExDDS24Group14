    "title": "I was severely injured in car accident by someone with no assets and no insurance. What do I do?",
    "question": "Vertebra in my spine were crushed in a car accident that was the fault of the other driver in November of last year. He confessed to the police at the scene that his vehicle had been swerving and fishtailing for the last two days. The driver at fault did not have insurance, the vehicle wasn't registered to him, and it was most likely a work vehicle and he had been on the job at the time of the accident due to him calling his boss while in the ambulance on his cellphone and telling him to pick up the items and tow the vehicle. He has a lawyer that is protecting him from answering any questions so that my lawyer is unable to find out his employment at the time of the accident. My insurance does not cover the amount that I require to pay the hospital. I don't want to go into bankruptcy for something I didn't do, all I want to do is get some sort of justice, even if it's jail time for the driver. None of this was my fault. I am being basically told my pain doesn't matter because the laws and situation protect the driver because he has no assets. I have half a million dollars in medical debt that I am constantly being harassed about by collection agencies and I don't know what to do.",

        "You need a lawyer who will actually sue. Maybe the employer can be held accountable. Whatever is happening now isn't good enough.",
        "Your insurance should be part of this. You should have uninsured/underinsured coverage that assists in the matter.",
        "You need to hire an experienced personal injury attorney immediately if you don't already have one. That attorney will investigate the employment issue, if the employee was operating on behalf of the employer and all other issues of liability and insurance.",
        "Get an experienced personal injury lawyer who will file a lawsuit against the driver, take his deposition, and find out under oath who the company is. An attorney can hire an investigator to find out this information as well, and the DMV should have registered owner information if you did not get it when the accident took place. If your attorney is not willing to do these things, hire a different attorney."

    "title": "Can the attorney, that represented the landlord and won default judgment, become an original creditor?",
    "question": "A default judgment was given to landlord. His attorney became the original creditor somehow. The lawyer then sold it to a debt collector to collect. Can this be done without recording on the court docket? Is this legal?",
    "answers": [
        "That is the problem with allowing a lawsuit to end up with a default judgment. That judgment becomes an \"asset\" that can be sold to others. So the answer to your question is yes.",
        "Judgments get sold or otherwise transferred all the time.",
        "Realistically, that is obviously the least of your problems. You really need to file bankruptcy. To properly answer your questions and address your concerns, the best way to handle this is with an in person consultation with an experienced CA bankruptcy attorney. Use AVVO's Find a Lawyer tool to select a qualified attorney. Good luck. THIS IS NOT LEGAL ADVICE! YOU NEED TO SPEAK TO AN ATTORNEY WHO IS LICENSED IN YOUR STATE FOR LEGAL ADVICE. This is merely suggestions for you to think about in discussing your situation with the local attorney."

        "You don't need a SSN, ITIN will work. HOWEVER, if by any chance you incurred debt through the use of a phony SSN, consult with an experienced, local, bankruptcy attorney before filing anything.\n\nGood luck!\n\nRob Taylor",
        "Yes. The law does not require you to have a SSN. An ITIN will work just fine. I see them all the time. Good luck.",
        "You do not need a social security number to file bankruptcy. An ITIN is sufficient.",
        "Yes. Call the court clerk and ask them what you use for a social security number code..I believe it will be using only zeros. I put an addendum to the Petition stating that you have no social security number as otherwise they will probably ask you that. Good luck.",
        "Yes. You should consult and/or retain a bankruptcy attorney because the procedure is not as simple as you may think.",
        "Yes there is no requirement that you have a Social Security Number in order to file for protection from your creditors. An attorney in your area can explain this in detail."

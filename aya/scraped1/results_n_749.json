    "title": "Can you still settle with a creditor after a judgement?",
    "question": "I was enrolled with a debt relief company for over a year but still received summons from 2 creditors so I decided to do chapter 7. I’ve been working with this lawyer and he said at first it is doable then he went on vacation for a month , he recently came back and said I can’t do chapter 7 and now I received a judgement on one the creditors. Is it too late to settle with them what are my other options the lawyer suggest to go for chapter 13 but it would involve my husband’s finances and he doesn’t want to be involved with my debts.",

        "You definitely need to see another lawyer. I think that there are clearly some undisclosed facts here. but a new lawyer should do better job of explaining your options. FYI, debt relief companies are mostly scams. There are a few good ones out there but I don't think you hooked up with one And you neglected to read the fine print.",
        "Everything is negotiable. If you need to file a bankruptcy, then continue to speak with your attorney. If, however, you wish to simply settle an outstanding lawsuit, then a debt settlement can be entertained. Either way, you may very well benefit from having an analysis conducted on your total financial picture. See the advice of local San Diego debt resolution attorney for more options.",
        "Definitely get yourself another bankruptcy attorney in Chula Vista! Bankruptcy attorneys typically offer free consultations - take advantage of one. I don't understand why you would qualify for Ch. 7 before his vacation, but not after?",
        "It's possible to settle with a creditor after a judgment, but it's an uphill battle. With their judgment, they can garnish your wages and/or levy your bank accounts, so they're not particularly motivated to settle unless you have a substantial lump-sum payment.\nWhen you file BK, your husband's income must be factored in to the calculations of your disposable income. So it's possible that you may not qualify for Chapter 7; but you should probably get a 2nd opinion ... not because he said you can't, but because he left you hangin' while he vacationed for a month.",
        "Sounds like you might want to get another lawyer. I recommend D.J. Rausa in San Diego. You need a second set of good eyes on this. D.J. is the best."

    "title": "I am being sued for unpaid wages, restitution to employees. will bankruptcy chapter 7 discharge them?",
    "question": "one attorney told me \"no\", another one said, \"yes, after 6 months, they are dischargable\" which is it?",
    "answers": [
        "Here are the answers:\n\n1) Wages Owed to Employees 180 days prior to filing bankruptcy: Priority Claim -- This means it is not dischargeable.\n2) Wages owed to employees earlier than 180 days prior to filing bankruptcy: unsecured - this means it is dischargeable\n3) Judgment for unpaid wages against you - they can start a lawsuit in bankruptcy to have this portion declared non-dischargeable under 523(a)(4) defalcation in a fiduciary capacity - you'll need to fight this battle in bankruptcy court.\n\nThere are special rules for union wages.\n\nHope this helps",
        "Where the 6 months comes in is that under BK Code Sect. 507, unpaid wages earned within 180the days before thethe filing of thethe petition are considered unsecured priority claims, up to a certain dollar amount per employee. Therefore they may or may not be dischargeable depending on your fact situation. I agree your use of the word \"restitution\" may mean non-dischargeable, but it depends on the facts of your case. So, you should consult with a local bankruptcy attorney to review your entire financial situation and case facts to determine dischargeability.",
        "Mr. Whitaker is correct -- and your addition of \"restitution\" to your facts raises a host of other problems. There is no \"dischargeable after six months\" rule and the discharge of taxes is dependent upon other factors mentioned in my previous answer. Speak to someone soon.\n\nGood luck!",
        "Unpaid wages are dischargeable but \"restitution\"may not be. What is the basis of the restitution claim? If some sort of wrongdoing is alleged, plaintiff(s) will have to get relief from the automatic stay to pursue their claims in state court or, more likely, file an adversary proceeding in BK court to object to you being discharged of your debt to them."

    "title": "Will my business debt transfer if I incorporate?",
    "question": "I owe on a couple credit cards and a personal loan that I used all for business. I have enough money to pay one of the two things. If I shut my business down I know that debt will belong to me because the business is a sole proprietorship. But what happens to this debt if A. I sell my business or B. I incorporate which is technically a new company. The new business shouldn't have that debt I think which would make it look more attractive to a business partner.",
    "answers": [
        "As a sole proprietor, the debts and assets of the business are your own personal debts and assets. So, to the extent you sell these assets, shut down the business and do not pay your creditors, YOU still owe the money. Depending upon the size of these debts, there are strategies you can employ to negotiate these debts and even not pay some of them.\n\nNow if you incorporate again in a new business, the new business is not liable for your own personal debts. However, a new business only has the creditworthiness of its principals, and with you shirking your debt obligations, you would not be considered credit worthy. So your new business would also be hampered by your own personal debt situation as the new business would only be extended credit if you personally guaranteed it. Now, your potential new business partner (should you get one), could be the personal guarantor of the new business.\n\nWord of advice: don't start a business without having a lawyer my friend.",
        "You will remain personally liable for the debt notwithstanding a sale of your business.

        "These are personal debts to you, even though they might have been used for business purposes. Whether you sell your business or incorporate a new company, the debt is still yours personally.

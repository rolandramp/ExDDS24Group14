    "title": "Will my paypal and eBay seller account be closed if I file for bankruptcy?",
    "question": "I do not owe any debts associated with PayPal loans. I currently have a business selling on eBay and collect payments through PayPal.",
    "answers": [
        "If you do not owe any money on the account you do not have to list the account because they are not technically creditors, however if they find out about the bankruptcy they may close the account. You should be able to open a new account post bankruptcy.",
        "In addition to the comments above, you need to engage bankruptcy counsel to analyze what revenue, if any, you will need to provide to your bankruptcy estate if you file. Based on the statements you have made, it is possible that you do not need to notify Paypal of your bankruptcy filing but you and counsel must consider (and may be required) to identify the source of your revenue to a chapter 7 or 13 trustee or the United States' Trustee's Office, depending on which chapter you elect. This may have an effect on your underlying concern about having your account cancelled. Best of the luck to you.",
        "Agreeing with Mr. Steingraber above, I would add that I have heard that PayPal gets spooked by bankruptcy filings. However, there is no justification for this and I am of the opinion that it is illegal. A recent California Supreme Court decision held that websites such as PayPal may not treat attorneys differently if they represent bankruptcy petitioners, and the same should be true for the petitioners.",
        "If you don't owe them anything, you do not need to list them in your BK as creditors. They will not get notice of your BK. If they find out some other way, they may cancel your account relationship."

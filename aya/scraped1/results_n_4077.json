    "title": "I won a judgement against someone who owes me money. How can I get them to pay?",
    "question": "I was awarded a judgement nearly a year ago, but the debtor has yet to pay anything. What is my next course of action? I know where they work so how can I begin the process to garnish their wages or do I need to go through the process of doing the debtors examination first. I know that the debtor will be filing their taxes soon so I would like to take the fastest route to getting some of the money they owe me. I have been trying for the past year to get info on the debtor and I finally found out where they work so I would like to get what I can before they disappear again. I appreciate you taking the time to read this and your advice is most appreciated.",
    "answers": [
        "Do the wage garnishment now. You can garnish up to 25% of the wages. The debtor can file a Claim of Exemption. If so, you must promptly file an opposition to the Claim of Exemption, and there will be a court hearing. At the hearing you can ask the debtor a few questions about his/her other assets, bank accounts, other debts, who else helps pay his/her rent, the landlord's name, address and phone number. That information can help you later.",
        "Post judgment collections can be frustrating. You don't need a judgment debtor exam, if you know where your debtor lives; you can file a writ of execution and have the Sheriff begin garnishment. You could also bring in a collection attorney to keep up with the investigative work and to ensure that the collection goes as well as possible.",
        "Start with looking on the court's website. I believe the Los Angeles county court website has a fairly decent explanation of the process. If it is a sizable amount of money you are seeking, it may make sense to retain an attorney. As counsel has said, collecting on a judgement can be a big hassle. Fortunately, you know where they work, which is always a plus. Good Luck.",
        "In addition to the other answers you have gotten, you may want to employ the help of a collection attorney. These attorneys are very good at finding bank accounts, employment and other assets. Usually the attorney fees and cost are included with the judgment language so it may be very little cost to you. To fine on, check the avvo finder."

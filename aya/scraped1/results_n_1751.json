    "title": "Do we need an attorney for declination of executor letter in Butte County, California?",
    "question": "My husband's father just passed away and he was named executor, but he wants to decline the responsibility. Additionally, he'd like to decline inheritance of his father's house and property (the debt on it is too high). Is an attorney's help necessary here or can we write these letters ourselves and file them with the county on our own (father was from Butte county)? Are there templates we might be able to use?",
    "answers": [
        "Yes. I recommend H father consult probate counsel.\nSeparate pleadings required. 1. Declination to Serve as Executor and; 2. Disclaimer of Inheritance.\nNo. No standard form available to use for these purposes.\nconsult probate counsel for assistance.",
        "Best to have a probate attorney help you. You could proceed to be the estates administrator if you wanted. Being administrator won't mean you are liable for the debts of the estate. No templates.",
        "He should certainly speak with an attorney, many give free consultations, to see if he is making the right decision and what if anything he needs to do. If the house is the only asset and there is no equity, he may have to do nothing. Take advantage of a free consultation to determine what is best.",
        "The two documents you need are a declination to serve as Executor and a Disclaimer. You should seek counsel to prepare them as there are legal requirements on what goes into a disclaimer and you should know the consequences. The declination can be a paper you sign and give to the successor Executor, if any. Bye disclaimer would be given to the proper party involved in the real estate, like the mortgage holder."

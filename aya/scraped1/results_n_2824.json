    "question": "In (G) it refers to Gifts to Charities and individuals other than Attorney-in-Fact/Agent. Since he assigned a person who is his boyfriend/partner as his Power of Attorney which I am concerned about. Can a Power of Attorney use this person's money to pay off his own small debts meaning credit cards, pay for a storage unit, gas for his vehicle and everyday necessities? What are the limits for a Power of Attorney to purchase things? I just want to make sure this person isn't going to screw him over like others have done in the past. Will he have problems or considered he is breaking the law on anything I mentioned?",

        "A General Power of Attorney is a document that creates many significant legal powers and allows the person who is the attorney in fact to essentially stand in the shoes of the person who gave the power.

A durable power of attorney is valid despite the loss of mental capacity by the principal.

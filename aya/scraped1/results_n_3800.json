        "While the bankruptcy is pending you cannot sue them. You should get notice from the court that you are a creditor. You will probably have to file a proof of claim form to have any chance of getting your money back. Since you are an unsecured creditor, you are last in line. I would either hire counsel, which may be expensive, given your small debt, or wait and file a proof of claim form, if you are listed as a creditor. I am not suggesting that $1500 is a small amount. However, depending on his debts, it may not get paid or only a small sum may get paid back.",

It also sounds to me like this is border line fraud. The Dental Office would have known they were going to file bankruptcy in all likelihood, and consequently it would be well worth finding the person to talk to at the Dental Office to get this back.

    "title": "Do I need to file an Adversary Proceeding to prevent my debt from being discharged if I'm named as a contingent debtor?",
    "question": "I invested my inheritance, divorce settlement and IRA with an investor who has filed for personal bankruptcy and has ceased payments to all investors in his business entities. If the FBI, District Attorney, SEC and now Bankruptcy Trustee Attorney and CPA are investigating him for FRAUD and he has named me as a contingent creditor, is it necessary for me to file an Adversary Proceeding to prevent my debt from discharge should his Chapter 7 request be granted? The authorities have assured me that they are working diligently and to be patient but myself and over 100 others who have had our money stollen are wondering how to proceed. Many of us, myself included, relied on this interest income for daily living expenses and cannot afford an attorney. Can I do this myself?",
    "answers": [
        "Answer to whether you should file an adversary action yourself - NO. Answer to whether you should file an adversary action at all - MAYBE. What you need to do is get a consult with a creditor attorney in the Santa Clara County area. That attorney should be able to help you understand your options and help you decide what to do. Good Luck.",
        "I personally would not advise filing an adversary proceeding as it is fairly technical. Beyond that, it won't speed anything up which seems to be your primary concern.\nYou got ripped off, it sounds like, and nothing would make you satisfied except to have the money magically re-appear in your bank account. This will only happen in the course of time, if indeed it happens at all.",
        "Can you do this yourself or should you do this yourself? The short answer to both questions is NO. Adversary complaints in bankruptcy proceedings are not a DIY project. If you have a lot of money at stake, get a competent BK atty to advise you and your fellow investors. You can pool your funds to get proper representation.",
        "Criminal courts and bankruptcy courts are two separate things. If the criminal court does not enforce the debt as a result of charges settled or not brought or jurisdiction ends, then if you failed to file an adversary action your debt will be gone IF in fact he obtains a discharge. Anyone can be there own attorney but every attorney on here will recommend you obtain one to make sure you do it right! An attorney can also advise you of one or MORE areas of the exceptions to discharge to file the action and differences between them including possibly attorney fees. Good luck.",
        "You should immediately consult with experienced bankruptcy counsel. You only have a certain time to file an adversary. If you do not file it, the debt will be discharged. It would be foolish to try to do it yourself."

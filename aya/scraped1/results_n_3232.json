I highly recommend you get in touch with him directly, as regardless of whether they threatened to do this or have done this, he will be able to give you excellent direction.",
        "You need to have an attorney review this right away. If the facts are what you say and it is clearly beyond the statute of limitations, I would be concerned about the plaintiffs character. It is very easy to imagine the plaintiffs agreeing to dismiss the case and then taking a default against you without you even knowing and 7 or 8 years later they come back, but this time with a judgment and 8 years of interest added to it. This sounds like a dirtbag lawsuit and you should expect dirtbag tactics. This is not a good time to learn about this area of law and you should hire an attorney right away.

        "Any creditor can file a lawsuit for an unpaid debt. Filing a lawsuit is the easy part. Getting the lawsuit properly served on the defendants can be a challenge if the defendants have moved around or are hiding from the process server. I don't recommend that, because process servers of debt collection lawsuits are not (in many of my clients' experiences) known for actually delivering lawsuits, they sometimes simply drop them in the garbage and my client does not know that they have a lawsuit against them, which they must fight, so a default judgment gets entered against them, which is challenging to dispute later. Better to get the collect lawsuit and hire a debt collection DEFENSE lawyer to fight it, than have a default judgment against you.\n\nWhether the payday lender will sue you 9 years after the debt was unpaid and you dispute this as not your debt, I cannot answer, but seems to be unlikely. More likely this is a false threat to try to get you to pay the debt. False statements by a debt collection agency violate the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA) for which the consumer could be entitled to actual damages and their attorney's fees. If this was the original creditor (which I doubt, due to so many years having passed), the creditor's false threats would have violated Cal. Rosenthal FDCPA. Consult an experienced consumer attorney if they are harassing you with phone calls and false threats and be aware that you have a one year statute of limitations, or any harassment claims will be barred after that one year expires.\n\nBy: Robert Stempler (please see DISCLAIMER below)\nCONSUMER LAW OFFICE OF ROBERT STEMPLER\nA Professional Law Corporation",

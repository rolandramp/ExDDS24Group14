    "title": "Can I file for bankruptcy AFTER there is a judgement against me?",
    "question": "I have about 100k in credit card debt and I ran out of money. I am collection proof and have NO job/assets/savings. I understand that banks will go after me and will try getting a judgement against me, and I am interested in defending myself against them so I at least get a \"fair\" hearing. I don't want to file for bankruptcy protection right now, because I am collection proof, but my question is, if I do get a judgement against me would that be possible to get rid of that debt by filing bankruptcy later (say in 2years)? Also, if you are interested in representing me in court against credit card companies (4) let me know, but I will only be able to pay % of amount that you will be able to safe me/negotiate for me and only if the total amount is dismissed/negotiated and not more than 5k.",
    "answers": [
        "Yes you can file bankruptcy after a judgment is entered and yes you can discharge the debt (assuming it is eligible for discharge).\n\nThe only thing to be aware of (and which likely doesn't matter in your case given your facts) is that if the judgment creditor obtains a lien against any property that you have, that lien will remain against the property after you receive your discharge, unless you take steps to remove the lien in the bankruptcy case (there are specific rules for doing that).",
        "My colleagues here have provided a great summary of your options in bankruptcy. You should know that AVVO rules prohibit us from directly soliciting clients via these posts. I would suggest that you research attorneys here on AVVO using the Find a Lawyer search function. You can search for attorneys in your area that have a practice that includes debt settlement and defending credit card lawsuits. Best of luck to you.",
        "You can wait to file bankruptcy. The risk you run is that you get a job that puts you over the means test threshold or you receive an inheritance or other windfall which puts you over the exemption limit. The timing of filing your bankruptcy can be critical. It's best to get professional advice.",
        "You can discharge a judgment obtained prior to bankruptcy so long as the debt for which the judgment is for is a debt that can be discharged in bankruptcy (i.e., it's not for a student loan, child support, or other nondischargeable debt). Here is a recent legal guide I wrote about the concept of being judgment proof: Excellent response from the handsome and brilliant Christopher Leroi",
        "Generally, yes. You may file bankruptcy to discharge debts including judgements. Consult with an attorney to assist you with the appropriate steps."

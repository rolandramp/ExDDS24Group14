    "title": "Will my credit union dump me if I file for bankruptcy?",
    "question": "I'm a member of Wescom Credit Union. I have a Wescom credit card that has a balance and I have an auto loan that also has a balance. Due to a job loss AND an injury within a period of only six months, I now find myself in the position of not being able to pay all my debts and as hard as it is for me to do, I'm seriously considering bankruptcy. I just recently read an article that said credit unions will dump any customers who file for bankruptcy. Is this true? I was hoping to be able to reaffirm the auto loan (my car is less than one year from being paid off) and I'm not sure if I can reaffirm a credit card. But even if I do reaffirm these things, can the credit union sever their relationship with me?",
    "answers": [
        "Credit unions are very sensitive about member loyalty. As such, if you default on debt owed to them, they do not want to continue extending credit to you because they feel at risk. I have had credit unions send letters stating that unless you reaffirm all of the debt that you cannot have a credit card or checking account with them. Only savings (no one is going to turn down savings account clients).... I don't think you should be too worried about it. Look at your bottom line financially.... I wouldn't necessarily recommend reaffirmation since you are filing BK to get out of debt, not to walk away with debt. Also, as a matter of public policy, must Judges do not approve reaffirmations of credit cards or mortgages because of the same reason.\n\nLastly - I would check with your credit union. Highly likely your credit card and your car loan are cross collateralized, meaning that your credit card is secured by your car loan, in which case you need to continue to stay current on the credit card in order to not default on your vehicle.\n\nShould you have any further questions, don't hesitate to reach out.",
        "To add to the other answers.\n1. You need to determine if it is a credit union credit card or one from a bank that uses the credit union name. This is common with small credit unions. However, Wescom is large enough that it probably has its own, but check.\n2. When you got the car loan, your loan documents probably stated that all of your deposits with the Credit Union and the car are security for the loan.",
        "You should discuss reaffirming accounts with your attorney, especially unsecured credit card accounts. Opening an account at a new credit union is usually substantially cheaper than reaffirming an unsecured debt.\nThat said, yes a credit union will likely terminate your membership if you cause them a loss. That means your atm privileges will be revoked and all other membership privileges will be terminated. That does not mean you won't be able to keep your car, just that you won't be able to have the payment directly withdrawn from your account.\nMost credit unions are part of a system where you can use any credit union atm to deposit and withdraw money from a participating credit union account, so open an account elsewhere, and save yourself the money in reaffirming the Wescom unsecured debt.",
        "My 25+ years is that an account with a credit union is a privilege, not a right. Therefore, they could very well cancel your account with them. They could also offset any deposits in any of the accounts, so you may want to go get a new account with a credit union or bank that you do not owe any money to.",
        "Credit Unions are member owned and if you cause the credit union a loss you will no longer be able to remain a member. Credit Unions also love to cross collateralize. This means you pledge all collateral such as cars, boats, checking accounts, share accounts etc for every loan. So if you only owe $3,000 on your car worth $4000 and you have another loan or credit card at the credit union with a $10,000 balance then you have to reaffirm the full $13,000 with whatever interest they are charging to keep the car and your membership at the credit union. Contact a local bankruptcy attorney to schedule a consultation. You can search for an attorney using the Avvo \"Find a Lawyer\" link at the top of this page.",
        "If you mean by \"dump\" your credit privileges on your credit card will be cut off, the answer is \"yes\". If you keep making payments on the auto loan, you will be able to keep the auto. Most credit unions link the credit card debt to the auto loan, but the customer rarely understands this and doesn't take time to read the credit card agreement. You will likely discover that when you finish paying off the auto loan, you will not get the title back because it was linked to the credit card debt. If you continue to pay the credit card debt after filing BK, there will be no problems. Keep the insurance on the auto current. You should be OK. I also recommend having a lawyer represent you in your BK. Click the Avvo tab \"Find a Lawyer\". Some of us offer a free consultation by phone or in person. Take us up on it. If this answer was helpful, please leave feedback on Avvo. Good luck.",
        "I have not seen a credit union terminate a member who has filed for bankruptcy protection and relief. Many past clients have used credit unions with accounts for checking, savings, auto loans, and more.\n\nI have seen credit unions require reaffirmation agreements on secured auto loans. Doing so may have benefits to you if filing bankruptcy but you would need a to speak to an attorney to determine what makes sense for your particular situation.\n\nFinally, credit unions may terminate certain “benefits” of a member who is in an active bankruptcy case such as stopping online account access or auto pay, no longer qualifying for new loan products or certain other member perks, however, this would not be the same as being kicked out or dumped from the credit union/terminating membership.",
        "Most debtors (over 95% I believe in my state) NEVER reaffirm. Your question indicates that in fact then you have NOT discussed bankruptcy with an experienced bankruptcy attorney and suggest you do before any other action so you can plan on when to file, whether to file, which chapter to file, who to pay , etc.\n\nMost persons vehicles are worth Substantially less than the $ owed on them! Thus, why not obtain another used vehicle later if that is true in your case and use the vehicle free for 2 months before filing and another 2 1/2 or more after before you lose it and save that money for another down payment on car worth what you buy it for, not negative equity? If you have that credit card with them I doubt any attorney will sign or judge sign an unsecured debt (not in all cases as cross collateralization could exist but even then doubt you have equity most likely). And the CU will undoubtedly sever that relationship but you can go anywhere else!\n\nBut other issues and facts can affect your case so I will point some of those out so you know you only have ONE thing to do now: See an experienced bankruptcy attorney in CA! There are plenty here on AVVO!\n\nYou need and want to enjoy your fresh start also. But the most important thing is to meet with an\nattorney as you asking this question means you have not. You care about 2 goals: keeping\neverything you have equity in and discharging all your debts. If you don't have any of the\nexceptions to discharge you will obtain that goal; most exceptions are set forth in 11 USC. 523\n(Google it) like child support, some income taxes, traffic (in a ch 7) and criminal fines , and\npresumption of student loans. But some debts are dischargeable in a ch 13 but NOT in a ch 7 so\nyou want to make sure and your attorney will discuss any such types with you also!\nYour exemptions depend on what state you have lived in in the last 2 years and thus if in your\nstate, then your states exemptions will apply. Most persons filing keep everything they own but\nyour attorney will confirm that with you when they learn everything you own and the equity\nthereof!\nSome secured debts like homes, vehicles, other secured debts an attorney will discuss your\noptions on also as you must list any debts; but that does not mean you will lose them unless you\nhave too much equity or are in default on paying for them! Discuss those options if they apply\nwith your attorney too.\nBut other issues can arise that can greatly harm your case. Just one example: If you paid back a\nrelative $3,000 11 months ago and now file bankruptcy next week, the trustee can SUE that\nrelative to retrieve that $3,000 (under what is called a preference) for the benefit of the\nbankruptcy estate. As a result, most attorneys don't charge to meet with them the first meeting so\nmeet with one no matter what.\nMany great attorneys can be found right here on AVVO in your state so look, call, and meet one\nas soon as you can.\nYou should also want to know when to file: is there an advantage of waiting versus filing now\nand who should you pay between now and then! Good luck and enjoy your later fresh start.",
        "Almost all, if not all credit unions, will not allow any member to remain a member of the credit union if the credit union takes a loss on any accounts. Typically, a credit union will not terminate your membership if you reaffirm both loans. Thus, it is not the bankruptcy filing that matters, it is payment of the credit union debt."

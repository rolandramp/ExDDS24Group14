    "title": "Can I sue my employer for not telling me they filed for bankruptcy while they owe me wages and thus I missed proof of claim?",
    "question": "Hi, in 2015 I filed for a small claim in court for unpaid wages with my employer and the court ruled in my favor; however, at the same time, my employer which is a corporation (it's a restaurant) filed for bankruptcy without telling me so I was not able to file for a proof of claim. So even though I won my case, the corporation I filed against technically doesn't exist anymore. I know the employer I worked for has a lot of assets and confronted them multiple times about my unpaid wages but they refused to pay. Can I file for a small claim against the person/inidividual for fraud and deceiving me?",

        "If a corporation filed BK and failed to list you as a creditor, but the corporation had little or no assets, not filing a your claim timely doesn't matter. Corporations do not get its debts discharged, but they do get the automatic stay preventing a creditor from suing it. Sorry, but your chances for recovery appear slim at this point. As said by my colleague, if you want to sue an individual not the corporation, you will need a lawyer to present your claim/lawsuit to \"pierce the corporate veil\".",
        "Anyone can sue anyone for anything. That being said, you worked for a corporation, not an individual, therefore, the person is not the proper defendant. In theory, you may be able get past the corporate veil, but, you may be beyond the statute of limitations. Too many facts are unknow."

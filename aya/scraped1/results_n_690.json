    "title": "Can I get a bankruptcy after I have been taken to court for the fees?",
    "question": "Good morning. Long story short, I have A LOT of credit card debt. I have been taking care of a relative, have been out of work for awhile, ran up cards for living expenses, and have no way of paying them now. I cannot even afford the $1195 for a bankruptcy. Credit card companies are taking me to court (and one already won a case, which is odd, given I was never given a court date). I am frantically applying for jobs, and am not eligible for any type of unemployment. Once I am able to get a bankruptcy, can I include ALL of my outstanding debt? Can I include those that have gone to court, or may soon go to court? I am at such a loss right now, and do not now what to do next.",

        "There is nothing \"odd\" about a judgment rendered against you because you were not \"given a court date\". When you were served by the process server the papers said you had 30 days to respond. If you didn't respond because you were waiting for \"a court date\", the judgment against you was taken by default due to a lack of timely response. This was not a small claims case but a Superior Court case. Different rules = different outcome. The good news is barring any irregularities in how you accumulated your debt, your unsecured debt, including any judgments can be successfully discharged in a Chapter 7 case. BTW, $1195 for filing your bankruptcy case is actually quite a bargain. For sure, don't play lawyer and do your own case. You can seek help from the Legal Aid and other community legal service groups. I think the bankruptcy court also has free seminars hosted by local attorneys where you can get the help you need. Good luck to you. If this response was helpful, please leave your feedback on Avvo website.",
        "Yes - dischargeable debts, like credit cards, are dischargeable even after they obtain judgments against you.\nWhich means you have time to retain a bankruptcy attorney and start setting money aside for it.",
        "You raise a couple of issues here. First, a creditor must prove service in order to obtain a court judgment. If they attempt to serve you and you avoid service they have the option to apply for substitute service in which notice can either be posted on your door or sent by regular mail. Therefore, many have the illusion that they have not been served. Second, bankruptcy is always an option. However, the decision cannot be taken lightly because the chapter you are interested in shows up on your credit profile for 10 years. I'm not saying that is a great impediment but you have to know what you are doing.. To get an idea you should schedule a consultation with an attorney who practices as many offer free consultations. Without more information it is impossible to see whether bankruptcy is in your best interests. Good luck.",
        "I just left a bankruptcy settlement conference in which a creditor filed an adversary complaint that my client's case not be discharged under 11 USC sec 523. This section of the law specifies the most common reasons why someone might not be able to receive a discharge. Most of it involves a claim that the debtor engaged in some kind of egregious misconduct that if not criminal in nature, approaches criminality. Unless you have a suit that charges you with doing something improper other than simply not paying your bills, it is not likely you will have a problem, unless you are foolish enough to proceed pro se. Hope this perspective helps!",
        "I agree with my colleagues comments. And, add that you should meet with a bankruptcy attorney immediately (many of us offer initial consultations at no charge). By talking with an attorney, you can discuss how all of this can be taken care of, timing, and dealing with these creditors until you can file bankruptcy. All debt that you owe at the time the bankruptcy case is filed, must and will be included in the case and will be discharged - with certain exceptions which you can learn about from the attorney you meet with. There is help out here for you."

    "title": "Is divorce in California biased against men?",
    "question": "I have been researching divorce attorneys for several months now. Sometimes, I feel that because I am a guy, and the primary bread winner, I am at a tremendous disadvantage. It's like the other party will be winning the lottery. Once property division, alimony, and child support are decided, the other party will walk away with a large sum of money, leaving the other party in debt. Meanwhile, who knows what the other party will do with their newly found fortune? I find it completely unfair to have to support a person that never wanted to work a day in their life. I can understand child support, but spousal support of more than one year duration; really? Any law changes in the near future? Will the advent of gay marriage affect how divorce , support and division of assets are handled?",

As to property, why shouldn't a spouse who has been a care provided not share equally in the community assets and debts?"

        "A \"LEVY\" is carried out to obtain the judgment debtor's PERSONAL PROPERTY such as: bank accounts, investment accounts, property in safe-deposit boxes, cash, vehicles, etc. If the judgment is against a company, a levy can reach the company's business assets too. Most creditors go after bank accounts if they can determine where the judgment debtor has his or her accounts. That is probably the risk that your father is facing. Your father has ten (10) days after service of the notice of levy to file a claim of exemption with the levying officer, if he claims that any of his personal property is exempt.\n\nAs far as the house is concerned: if the transfer of property from to you was completed after he was sued by this creditor and if the \"gift\" was an effort to avoid payment of the debt, it may be a \"fraudulent transfer.\" Additional steps would need to be carried out by the creditor in order to establish a fraudulent transfer occurred. If this is a concern, your father should consult a real estate attorney or bankruptcy attorney.\n\nA NOTICE OF LEVY does not have any effect on real property, whether in the judgment debtor's name or in someone else's name. However, you may still want to consult an attorney to see if there's anything you need to do to protect yourself.",
        "Garnishment is not the same as a levy. If you are the debtor, you are \"on the hook\" and son is not going be free and clear of your debt."

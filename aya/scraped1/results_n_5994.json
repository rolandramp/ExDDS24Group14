        "There is no stop Sheriff's Writ form.\n\nYou need to review the writ/levy documents closely. They contain instructions on how to claim exemption from judgment. The issue would then be if you qualify for exemption based upon your income and assets.",
        "Mr Lysle is correct.\n\nIf you are claiming exemption for a bank levy, then you need to prepare and mail to the levying officer (probably the county sheriff) this Claim of Exemption form: http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/ej160.pdf. If you are claiming exemption due to financial reasons, then prepare and attach this Financial Statement form to the Claim: http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/ej165.pdf.\n\nLikewise, if you are claiming exemption for a wage garnishment, here's the form: http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/wg006.pdf. If due to financial reasons, here's the form: http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/wg007.pdf.\n\nAfter the levying officer receives the Claim, he will freeze the levy or garnishment and provide notice to the judgment creditor, who will then have the option to oppose the claim and set the matter for court hearing.\n\nGood luck.",
        "You [probably want to file a Claim of Exemption. If a Garnishment, you will need Form WG 006. If it is a bank levy there is a different form. In either case, you will also need a Financial Statement, WG 007. If you have a different reason for contesting the levy or garnishment, you will need other forms and papers."

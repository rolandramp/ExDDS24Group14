    "title": "How does husband filing for bankruptcy impact my divorce case?",
    "question": "I have a 19 year marriage with four minor children (17, 14, 10, 7). I have been a stay home parent for all these years. We have a joint property and he is hiding all his assets. My husband is planning to separate and claiming that he won’t be able to afford two homes and that the house we currently live in needs to be sold. I have to find some other place to live. He has been consulting lawyers, and claiming that he may even file bankruptcy once he uses up all his savings. Can my husband file bankruptcy as a way to avoid paying child and spousal support?",
    "answers": [
        "I agree with all the above statements by the other attorneys that child support and spousal support are not affected by bankruptcy. These are not obligations he can wipe out.\n\nIf he files bankruptcy as he has threatened to do, the bankruptcy trustee is going to go after whatever has been “disappeared” by your husband. Trustees, and bankruptcy judges are not inclined to allow him to hide assets and will force him to prove up what he has done with money or other assets from the marriage. If he hides assets, he can end up being charged with and convicted of Bankruptcy Fraud.\n\nThe Trustee is there to collect unprotected community assets and his separate property to pay creditors. This could benefit you as this would pay some or all of those community debts, especially if there are priority income tax debts. That means you will have less debts that could come after you after the divorcel. If he files bankruptcy, the family law court could not order him to pay debts.\n\nYou can stop him from squandering the money or hiding it by YOU filing bankruptcy instead of him. Your filing means you won't have to worry any of the debts as none of the creditors could ever come after you as they are discharged. The family law court could not order you to pay these debts.\nIf you file first, you can have some control what home is protected though it will depend upon the amount of equity. The assets will not evaporate under the control of your husband.\n\nSadly, the law does not care about whether you or the kids do or don't need the home. It depends on the equity in the home and whether it is too much to protect.\n\nHere is another issue to throw into the mix. Right now, you can protect $100,000 in equity (i.e. the value of the home minus the debt owed on the home.) As of January 1, 2021, that will jump to $300,000 to $600,000 in protected equity. In the Bay Area it is likely to be in the $500,000-$600,000 range. Any filing before that could be a disaster, unless the equity is $100,000 or less.\n\nThere is too little information in your post for any attorney to give you advice on what to do. You need to meet with a highly qualified bankruptcy specialist to properly advise you in how to deal with this threat and whether it just might be a benefit to you to file.\n\nNow, the question is WHERE can you find an excellent bankruptcy attorney.\nUp until COVID you were pretty much limited to attorneys in your area. However, since COVID, a lot of the matters have become able to be handled via the internet including both telephonic and video “Zoom” court hearings. Additionally, attorneys can meet with you via video on \"Zoom\" without you leaving your home. That expands your options, though I would not recommend getting someone in San Diego or LA or Fresno to handle your case. Besides the Bay Area, other nearby ccounties can be a good choice if they have experience practicing on the Oakland Bankruptcy Courts. Ask to schedule a “Zoom” video appointment with the attorney. If they don’t know how to do a video appointment find someone that does.\n\nNext is HOW to find a competent attorney.\n\nA) You can go to the State Bar website and look up State Bar Certified Bankruptcy Law Specialists. Only a fraction of 1% of attorneys are certified by the state bar as bankruptcy specialists\n.\nB) You can also go to the National Association of Consumer Bankruptcy Attorneys (NACBA.org) website that provides lists of attorneys that represent consumer debtors only (not creditors.)\n\nC) You can also look at the AVVO.com lists. However, if you go there, look for:\nAn AVVO RATING of 10.0; Note that this is a better indicator of the skill level than subjective client reviews as they are much less reliable;\nAttorney endorsements;\nLength of bankruptcy law practice, at least 10 years though the more the better;\nExperience teaching bankruptcy law to attorneys; and\nPractices almost exclusively bankruptcy law.\n\nWhatever you do, see a highly skilled bankruptcy attorney immediately.\n\nI hope this helps.",
        "You say he is hiding assets. He should be made aware, if he hides assets from the bankruptcy court he may not get a discharge and further, unlisted hidden assets are not \"administered\" by the bankruptcy trustee and so remain assets of his bankruptcy estate. Get your own family law attorney to discuss your situation and learn your options. Don't trust your spouse. Especially if you are already accusing him of hiding assets.",
        "The US Bankruptcy Code treats domestic support obligations such as child and spousal support as priority debts. A debtor filing a Chapter 7 bankruptcy will NOT receive a discharge of the obligation to pay domestic support obligations. A debtor filing a Chapter 13 bankruptcy will pay a monthly payment to a Chapter 13 trustee. From that payment, the trustee will pay priority debt such as domestic support obligations before other creditors. During the Chapter 13, the debtor will be required to stay current with domestic obligations.",

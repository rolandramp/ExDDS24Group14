    "title": "Can a college hold my transcripts after bankruptcy.",
    "question": "I went to a college in the Winter of 2014 in California. I withdrew with what I thought was the right amount of time. I never got a notice from them about a balance. They had returned my student loans to the lender. I went to get my transcripts sent to a new college and they are saying i owe 1600. I filed Bankruptcy in December and had it Discharged in March. They are now saying it is 'student loan debt' so they can hold my transcripts. This doesn't seem right since the 'balance' is with the college, not my lender. Can they hold my transcripts for a discharged bankruptcy or no? They have been giving me the run around for a week and a half now, and have people 'reviewing' it but give me not ETA. Do i have case for action against the college or not?",

        "The first thing you should clarify is whether you owe the school tuition or student loans. I mean, did the school extend a loan to cover your tuition? Or is it just a balance of unpaid tuition? Generally speaking, student loans are not discharged in a Chapter 7 filing. You should check your schedules to see if you listed the tuition and the school as a creditor. If you did, then the debt is discharged. However, if you failed to even list the $1600, either because you did not know you owed the money or because you forgot, then the debt is still very much alive. If you used a lawyer's services for your bankruptcy proceedings, go talk to him, and he will be able to guide you. If you didn't have a lawyer, then you should definitely talk to a lawyer and present all the facts. Good luck!",
        "You apparently have two issues. The first--preliminary--issue is that the school seems to be taking the position that the debt in question is a student loan. That is possible, the school is (would be) the collector for Federal Perkins Loans. The more dubious position is if the school had you sign some sort of promissory note regarding unpaid tuition. The note converts any debt owed to the school to a student loan. The status of those \"springing student loan notes\" is up in the air in bankruptcy. So, you need to obtain better clarification as to the nature of the debt your owe. If the school is collecting on a Federal Perkins Loans, then that is a non-dischargeable student loan and everything the school is doing is legit (except that as Ariel points out, FERPA kicks in to allow you to at least see your transcript).\n\nThe second issue, assuming you are right regarding the nature of the debt (that it is just unpaid tuition and therefore discharged in your BK), is the withholding of the transcript.

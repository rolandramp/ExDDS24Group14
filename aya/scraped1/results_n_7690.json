    "question": "I had a recent problem with a debt collector, and they ended up violating my state and federal debtor's rights, of which I have sold proof. When I called them on it in writing, and mentioned I reserved my right to sue, they sold or transferred the account to another collection agency. Now I'm working things out with Agency B, which seems to be more professional.",

        "I agree with the second attorney. It is often worth it. You should consult with a consumer rights attorney in your area, as if he/she thinks the case is worthy they will most likely take on a contingency basis and seek their attorneys fees from the debt collector.

Also, although I do not practice in CA, your state has a pretty strong unlawful debt collection practices statute of its own which may significantly add to the relief.

Having your rights vindicated is relief in itself, and consumers who act to protect their rights send a strong message to these violators that their unlawful tactics are not good business.

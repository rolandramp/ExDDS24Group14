    "title": "How may I file bankruptcy? I am still legally married to my husband but we have separated more than 20 years ago.",
    "question": "There has been no communication whatsoever for over 20 years. I don't know his whereabouts. I am not even sure if he is still alive. I intend to file Chapter 7 and I learned that a married person who files bankruptcy without the other spouse must file a document called Spousal Waiver of Exemption which should be signed by the nonfiling spouse. How may I do this? Will the document even be required considering my situation? We have no children. We do not have any assets which were acquired while we were still together.",

        "I'm a bit late, and I believe the other attorneys have answered it thoroughly.\n\nI'm posting only to expand on this thing called \"community property,\" which came up a few times in the responses. I feel like you and other readers might benefit from a quick explanation of it, although you seem to have an instinct for it, so I could be telling you something you already know.\n\nIn California, and other Western states, we use a legal system called \"community property.\" As I understand it, it's actually a tradition picked up from when the states were under Spanish rule, although I think Louisiana uses it too. Anyway, the idea is that the majority of assets earned or acquired while you are married usually belong to the community, as well as any pre-marriage separate assets that you \"contribute\" to the community. So those community assets have to be dealt with in a divorce, a bankruptcy proceeding, and other legal proceedings.\n\nHowever, anything you acquire after you're separated (with some complexities) is your own property (and debt)--not the community's anymore. I noticed you said, \"we do not have any assets which were acquired while we were still together,\" so you seem to understand or have a good instinct for what's going on.\n\nGiven the long separation and the fact that you've long since lost touch, even if someone in your situation did have some community assets at one time, they are likely long gone or not worth thinking about. And in any event, spouses who are married can still file individually, although it can get complicated when they aren't or are only recently separated.\n\nBest of luck to you!",

        "I agree with the prior lawyers. The main thing is that based on what you said there is no community property so you can file an individual petition and then show in your schedules that there is no community property in the bankruptcy estate that would necessitate a spousal waiver.",

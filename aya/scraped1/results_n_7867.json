    "question": "for not paying credit card debt?",
    "answers": [
        "A bank will \"freeze\" an account under sections 541 and and 542 of the Bankrupotcy code after you file for bankrupcy because they have a duty to act in good faith and protect the Estate funds.",
        "They might need to have an order from a court overseas and of course the law in the country where the account is located would have to allow it as well. If the bank is a US bank (such as Citibank), I suspect that an order to seize an account would be valid throughout the world.\n\nHope this perspective helps!"

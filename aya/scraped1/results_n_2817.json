        "Question more complicated than simply whether realtors commissions are considered in BK. Trustee and court is interested in liquidation value of home. In determining liquidation value in C7 or C13 BK you start with FMV and deduct all costs associated with liquidation, including, not limited to: realtor commissions, title, debt secured by home, other liens against property, capital gain tax, exemptions. Consult BK counsel for more complete analysis of liquidation value and any unprotected equity in home.",
        "The starting point will always be fair market value (FMV), which can be the debtor's own opinion (see California Evidence Code ยง 813(a)(2), which makes the opinion of the owner of property admissible as evidence), an on-line valuation service of such as Zillow, Redfin, etc., a broker's opinion letter, or a formal appraisal. The FMV should always be disclosed, but when stating the value to the bankruptcy estate, it is entirely appropriate to reflect any costs of liquidation, including broker's commissions, escrow costs, etc., as well as possible tax consequences, i.e., capital gains, and the Chapter 7 trustee's fees to demonstrate the actual equity available for the homestead exemption and any potential non-exempt equity available to the estate for payment of creditor claims.\n\nHowever, the purpose of the opinion as to value needs to be taken into account. If liquidation is not a factor, then costs of sale cannot be considered. So, if the valuation is for purposes of determining whether a judgment lien against the property can be avoided due to its interfering with (impairing) the debtor's right to a homestead exemption, hypothetical costs of sale cannot be factored in.\n\nAs with my colleagues, whenever possible in this potentially complex area of the law, seeking the advice of a qualified bankruptcy counsel, preferably one who is certified as a specialist in the field, is always preferable.",
        "The value or the amount the home is presently worth should be a pure reflection of fair market value, so the amount you'd expect to get if you sold it at the time of filing. Many online services can be used (zillow) but it is even better to ask a local real estate agent what they think it would sell for.\nAs far as Realtors' commissions and cost of sale, that gets factored into the decision of the trustee when evaluating whether or not there will be a surplus from the sale to pay creditors after they pay cost of sale and pay off your exemption. Most local chapter 7 trustee's here in Orange County will almost automatically have their own Realtor go look at and evaluate any property that may have equity.\nEven when a home has equity over the exemption and cost of sale, there are still some good options which can allow you to keep the home by working with the trustee and making a deal. If you have any further questions, please feel free to call my office anytime.",
        "The value of a home is the Fair Market Value (FMV) of the home. Most attorneys will use zillow to calculate the FMV, especially in cases where there is absolutely no equity in the home. This is accepted by most trustees in the central district when determining whether there is equity. However, in more complex situations, such as Motions to Avoid Liens, or cases where your home has equity, an actual appraisal is needed or required. If the home has equity, and you are trying to exempt the equity, than the idea is to determine the amount that the trustee/creditors will receive after selling the home. This value received is calculated by deducting cost of sale, fees and other expenses that will be incurred when selling the home from the FMV. A good bankruptcy attorney will know the amount of deductions that are commonly accepted by trustees. This will allow the attorney to give you better advice as to how you want to approach the bankruptcy. This is extremely important because the value of a home can determine whether you should file Chapter 7 or Chapter 13, whether you might lose your home in bankruptcy, or whether you can avoid a second mortgage or judgment lien.\n\nI strongly suggest that you speak to a bankruptcy attorney and take advantage of the fact that most bankruptcy attorneys offer free consultations.",
        "I agree with my colleagues. The Trustee takes the amount you believe the fair market value of the home is. The secured debt owed on the property is subtracted and the resulting number is the equity the trustee is looking at. If your belief of the fair market value seems to low the trustee may conduct her own valuation of the property. In California, depending on which set of exemptions you use, you can protect up to $75k of equity of single; $100k if married; and $175k if disabled or over 55 years old. Consult with an experienced BK attorney especially prior to filing especially if you want to make sure you are able to protect your real property.",
        "The trustee relies on your opinion of value, but if it seems too low, an appraisal can be obtained or comps are available using various websites like Zillow, Trulia, etc. Selling costs of about 10% are also factored in. BK is not a DIY project. Click the Avvo tab \"Find a Lawyer\" and talk with a BK lawyer. Many of us offer free consultations.",
        "This is a more complicated question than it sounds. Essentially, the value you have to use is the value that the trustee would receive in selling the property. So, you have to determine what the property would be worth to a buyer and then deduct costs of sale, including realtor fees that the trustee would have to pay. How much those are in a theoretical sale is often the subject of debate. If you are considering bankruptcy, I would highly recommend that you consult with one or more local attorneys. Many offer free consultations, and can give you a good sense of your options in light of the entirety of your financial situation."

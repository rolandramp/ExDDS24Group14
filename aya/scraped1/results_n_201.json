    "title": "Can you use the CA homestead exemption for an SBA lien on your house used as collateral for a business loan?",
    "question": "We have a business hurting due to COVID and are considering personal Chapter 13. But it seems pointless since we have $90k in home equity and it seems the SBA will foreclose on our house even if declaring bankruptcy. We have seen conflicting articles on whether the homestead law applies to SBA home liens used as collateral on a loan so hoping to get clarification before committing to attorney fees as we don’t want to waste any money and time if the answer is ‘no’ anyway.",

        "This appears to be a revision of an earlier post. The homestead in California protects a certain amount of equity in your residence. Equity is the fair market value less liens. In the case of INVOLUNTARY liens, if they impair the homestead, they can be avoided in bankruptcy. In the case of VOLUNTARY liens such as mortgages and deeds of trust, they can only be stripped and avoided in chapter 13 or 11s IF there is no equity on which they can attach. It is probable that the SBA lien is a voluntary lien, so the ability to strip it depends on the value of the house less the superior liens. The stripping would not be possible if there is any equity for you to declare as a homestead on the date of filing.\nIE: if the house has a fair market value of $500,000 and you owe $350,000 on a first and $100,000 on the SBA second, you cannot strip the liens, but you have a homestead to protect the remaining $50,000 from other creditors. If you owe $450,000 on the first and $100,000 on the second, you cannot strip the lien, as there is equity to which it can attach. You have no equity so your homestead would be valuless. If you owe $550,000 on the first and $100,000 on the second, the second can be stripped because there is no equity to which the lien attaches, and again, no equity for you to homestead.\nSit down with an experienced bankruptcy attorney and discuss your situation to determine your options.",
        "You will need to speak to a lawyer about this as there are many factors to consider. Most bankruptcy lawyers offer free consultations and I suggest you take advantage and speak to one. If the lien is already secured against the house, your homestead will not take priority over the lien. But in a chapter 13 bankruptcy you can avoid foreclosure, pay off the lien, and come out with equity in the end. You will need to explore your income, assets, and debts when speaking to a bankruptcy lawyer.",
        "If the SBA loan is attached to the house as a lien then that lien would likely survive a chapter 13 bankruptcy unless that lien is allowed to be stripped during the chapter 13 bankruptcy. There are certain requirements to meet in order to strip a lien in bankruptcy such as, is the SBA lien in first or second position on your house?\n\nAlso, the homestead can be taken to protect a certain amount of equity in the house. Unless the SBA agrees to forgive the loan and release their lien against your house the lien would likely need to be paid during the close of escrow during the sale of the home (this dips into the equity of your home). Also, the SBA loan documents you signed to take out the loan should be reviewed.\n\nThe homestead is available for most homeowners to use to protect equity in their home. The amount of the homestead allowed to be taken depends on your circumstances and whether you meet certain criteria (i.e. married, dependents, disabled, income levels, etc...).\n\nAs a final note, chapter 13 bankruptcy does not require the debtor to sell his home, instead the homestead is more relevant in determining the amount of debt the debtor must payback during his chapter 13 case.\n\nChapter 13 is complex and thus I suggest you hire a chapter 13 bankruptcy attorney to help you through the process should you decide that direction.",
        "There are many options in address secured creditors through a Chapter 13. You should speak to an attorney that can review your situation in its entirety as there are many variables to determining the appropriate plan for you. A chapter 13, if feasible and confirmed, can prevent foreclosure a form of debt collection while your plan is active.",

    "question": "i met with a accident with my fault likely to get a verdict against me for more than 800,000 as per my insurance attorney. My insurance covers only 100,000 and they are not ready to . i'm not an USA citizen & i came here for working. i dont have any asserts on my name either here or in my home country. What are the options in front of me . (Moving out of country / consult a bankruptcy lawyer / consult a accident lawyer for negotiation ). If i consult bankruptcy or accident lawyer how much it will cost ?",
    "answers": [
        "I would recommend contacting a personal injury attorney in your area who has experience handling bad faith insurance claims. I do not see a need for you to move out of the country. The right personal injury attorney can likely negotiate settlement for you or assist you in a bad faith claim against your own insurance company if need be. Most lawyers will provide a free case review.",
        "You set out the options. get some quotes from local BK attys. paying a lawyer hourly to try to help you negotiate will cost depending upon how many hrs of this time is needed.",
        "As long as not due to a DUI, a bankruptcy lawyer should be consulted. Avvo has a great lawyer finder tool to locate an attorney close to your home. Good luck.",
        "If you have assets worth protecting, you should consult a law firm with experience and knowledge in advising clients in how not to violate the law in the manner of using and protecting your assets when facing the claims of substantial creditors. Attorneys with knowledge regarding \"fraudulent transfers\" and asset structuring, should be your first stop in calculating your rights. From there, you may be referred to bankruptcy counsel, if appropriate. It all depends upon your personal financial situation, and the circumstances surrounding the suit against you. You can probably get an initial consultation with such attorneys for something between $500 and $1,000. This money would be well spent in terms of getting an initial understanding of your options, planning and gaining peace of mind. After the initial consultation, the cost of protecting yourself would depend upon the path that you chose in doing so.",
        "Take a deep breath and explore with your insurance attorney what the issues are. Does he believe they will want a judgment against someone with no money or will they take the 100k in exchange for a release? (this is a public website so don't respond with facts).\nMost times people don't want to chase no money, but there may be something else going on.\nYes you can claim bankruptcy. For options contact a consumer attorney at www.naca.net for one near you. Most bankruptcy attorneys won't charge much if anything for an initial consultation. They will give you a scale of fees if you want to go through with it. You already have an accident lawyer--I suggest you sit down with them.",
        "If you have no assets, it is extremely unlikely that a plaintiff's lawyer will spend the time and money to obtain a verdict against you. Moreover, if the plaintiff has demanded that your insurance company pay its policy limits and the insurer has refused, those limits are likely now irrelevant; the insurer has an obligation to you to settle within policy limits if reasonably possible, and if it fails to do so is liable for any excess judgment.\n\nYou need to talk to your lawyer about possible bad faith claims. If your lawyer will not discuss those claims with you, ask for an independent lawyer to appointed who will discuss possible conflicts of interest with your insurance company. If the insurance company refuses to provide independent counsel, then you may wish to consult with a personal injury lawyer about your possible bad faith claims.",
        "I second Attorney Harrell's answer. Most debts and liabilities are discharged through bankruptcy. However, you generally cannot discharge debts for personal injury caused by driving drunk or under the influence of drugs.\n\nIf this was in fact a car accident where it is alleged (and proven) that you were incapacitated by drugs or alcohol, you may be unable to discharge the personal injury verdict through bankruptcy. Therefore depending on how far along you are in the personal injury case, you need to be weary on what statement of facts are agreed to on this case.\n\nYou need to speak with a personal injury defense attorney (if you don't already have one) about the facts and consequences of the car accident. And you should also consult with a bankruptcy attorney on bankruptcy after determining the various likely outcomes of the personal injury case.\n\nMost bankruptcy attorneys offer an initial free consultation. With accident lawyers, it depends on the attorney. Good luck!",
        "Moving out of the country is probably not necessary. Your best bet is to consult with a bankruptcy attorney. I believe most of them will provide a free initial consultation.",
        "Was alcohol involved in this accident? Were any criminal charges filed against you? Is this case going to trial? How far along is the civil suit against you? Your question leaves out a lot of vital facts. If your accident did not involve drinking and driving, you should consult a bankruptcy attorney, and see if you qualify for relief under Chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. You can discharge the entire amount of the personal injury claim in a Chapter 7 case, and the plaintiff will only be able to recover your liability insurance proceeds, and maybe some UM coverage from the plaintiff's own automobile insurance carrier. Go see a bankruptcy attorney ASAP.n"

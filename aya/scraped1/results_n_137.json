    "title": "Can I trade in my vehicle if I just retained a lawyer for filing chapter 7 in a couple months?",
    "question": "I have a 2010 vehicle ($7,000 value) that is needing new brakes and tires and probably more but I'm afraid to find out but I've been looking to trade it in before even considering bankruptcy. My husband and I separated in October and he's the main reason I'm in such bad debt. He and I still have a decent relationship and I still have my stepdaughter much of the time. He offered to buy me a reliable car but I'd need to trade my current vehicle in as a down payment. If the new vehicle remains in his name, can I use my vehicle as the down payment or will that look bad to the bankruptcy trustees?",
    "answers": [
        "Hi,\n\nI think it would look bad to the Trustee if you don't include your name on the title to the new vehicle since you'll have transferred one of your assets for less than fair value (aka \"gift\") in the 2 years prior to filing the bankruptcy petition. To avoid risking 1) the loss of your entire discharge and 2) a jail sentence you'll be required to disclose this gift on your Statement of Financial Affairs for Individuals Filing for Bankruptcy. It does not look as bad as closing a bank account and putting the cash in a safe in your home but making any gift worth more than $600 before bankruptcy is a little suspicious.\n\nPotentially Better Idea\nWITHOUT KNOWING ANYTHING ABOUT YOUR INCOME, EXPENSES, OTHER ASSETS OR DEBTS I would suggest definitively determining the value of the vehicle right now by visiting a Carmax and obtaining an offer from them to buy your car being sure to mention the bad brakes and other possible defects. My guess is the value will be less than the amount you may \"exempt\" on your bankruptcy petition or close enough to make it unprofitable for the Trustee to sell (she will incur selling expenses). If Carmax doesn't make an offer then obtain the KBB Private Party Value and reduce it by the cost estimates you have from licensed mechanics regarding each defect. Include \"12/28/2020 Carmax purchase offer\" or your value formula on your Schedule A/B Property, Part 2 Vehicles, in the \"other information\" box for review by the Trustee.\n\nUpon abandonment by the Trustee (closure of the case in 3-5 months from when you file) you are free to do as you wish with the vehicle as it is now yours again (no longer your bankruptcy estate's). You may request the Trustee to abandon the vehicle sooner with a motion but that will add to the cost of your bankruptcy ($188 to the court and additional fee and costs to your attorney).\n\nBest of luck to you,\nKale",

        "First, I would find and discuss in detail with an attorney FIRST. Only then can we know all the facts as an attorney. For example we dont know if you owe money on the vehicle. Do not discuss any of this with your husband. Wait and discuss with an attorney first.\n\nSecond, we dont know if any assets are community, or separate and whether or not both of you should file.\n\nThird, in general , there is nothing wrong with buying a car or trading one in before filing. Things happen; vehicles break down. In fact for some persons about to start a 3 to 5 yr ch 13 case it is often smart to obtain another vehicle first if one is owned that is not expected to last that long.\n\nFourth, there are many other issues and facts that affect an attorneys advice to you so I will point those out next so you understand you only need to do one thing: call and find an experienced attorney near you now.\n\nYou need and want to enjoy your fresh start also. But the most important thing is to meet with an attorney as you asking this question means you have not. You care about 2 goals: keeping everything you have equity in and discharging all your debts. If you don't have any of the exceptions to discharge you will obtain that goal; most exceptions are set forth in 11 USC. 523 (Google it) like child support, some income taxes, traffic (in a ch 7) and criminal fines , and presumption of student loans. But some debts are dischargeable in a ch 13 but NOT in a ch 7 so you want to make sure and your attorney will discuss any such types with you also!\n\nYour exemptions depend on what state you have lived in in the last 2 years and thus if in your state, then your states exemptions will apply. Most persons filing keep everything they own but your attorney will confirm that with you when they learn everything you own and the equity thereof!\n\nSome secured debts like homes, vehicles, other secured debts an attorney will discuss your options on also as you must list any debts; but that does not mean you will lose them unless you have too much equity or are in default on paying for them! Discuss those options if they apply with your attorney too.\n\nBut other issues can arise that can greatly harm your case. Just one example: If you paid back a relative $3,000 11 months ago and now file bankruptcy next week, the trustee can SUE that relative to retrieve that $3,000 (under what is called a preference) for the benefit of the bankruptcy estate. As a result, most attorneys don't charge to meet with them the first meeting so meet with one no matter what.\n\nMany great attorneys can be found right here on AVVO in your state so look, call, and meet one as soon as you can.\n\nYou should also want to know when to file: is there an advantage of waiting versus filing now and who should you pay between now and then!

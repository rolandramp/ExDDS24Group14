    "question": "Hello,",
    "answers": [
        "I agree with my colleagues - if you have no defense to the debt, it is likely a waste of your time to tell the Judge you can't afford to pay. If the debt is a valid debt that you owe, the creditor will prevail and get a judgment against you. Before that occurs, locate an experienced bankruptcy attorney in your area who can analyze your bankruptcy options. You should look into this immediately. Good luck.",
        "Given that you are being sued, you can't afford to wait. As the lawyers above stated, having no money is not a defense to a judgment against you. If you wait, the credit will simply get a judge and wait till they can attach it to your bank account, wages, vehicles, or any other assets you may acquire later. You cannot wait to call a lawyer. You need to call one now and gather the funds to hire one, especially if you have other debts and those creditors are likely to come after you next. Most lawyers will evaluate your situation and try to quote you the best price they can to handle your matter.",
        "All these questions are exactly why you need an attorney.",
        "I agree with my colleagues and can only add that you should talk to a bankruptcy lawyer now to determine if the law suit is over a dischargeable debt.",
        "There's no reason to wait. The lawsuit will be stayed upon the filing and you should inform the attorney for the other party as soon as you have the case number. So long as the debt is dischargeable (and especially if the other party does not file a motion or an adversary proceeding before the deadline to litigate whether it is dischargeable for one of the statutory reasons), the case will be over. Why waste time and energy on state court litigation that is unnecessary if you have no resources to fight it and no assets for the other party to collect?",
        "Telling the judge you have no money in defense will get you nowhere. \"I can't pay\" is not a defense. If you tell the plaintiff you can't pay, he's likely to want to want to work out a settlement for some kind of payment, but unlikely to let you off the hook entirely, especially if it's already reached litigation.\n\nI'm not sure why you would want to put yourself through a court trial just to see what a judge would order as the judgment, if your only defense is inability to pay. As I said, it's not a defense. I would suggest contacting a local , experienced bankruptcy attorney to discuss your situation and options. You can use the AVVO find a lawyer function to find bankruptcy attorneys in your area, call to schedule and see with whom you are comfortable. Most bankruptcy attorneys offer a free initial consultation, and in these days of COVID, you might be able to do the consultation over the phone.",
        "I am sorry to hear of your financial dilemma. If you actually owe the money, you are wasting your time and money \"fighting\" it in court. I agree with my fellow lawyers who have recommended filing BK. The BK will stop the pending lawsuit and prevent the plaintiff from proceeding. You will most likely get a discharge of that debt along with any other unsecured debts you may owe.\n\nRemember, BK is more than checking boxes on forms you find online. Find/consult/hire a lawyer in your area using the Avvo feature \"Find a Lawyer\". Make a list of 4-5 having many 5 star reviews from satisfied clients. If you don't get a prompt call back from one, go on to the next on your list. Some offer a free consultation by phone or in person. Good luck and God bless."

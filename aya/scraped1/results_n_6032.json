        "When you file bankruptcy everything you own becomes property of the estate. If the item has been exempted it can be kept. If the debtor has expempted everything he owns then you are what we call a no asset chapter 7 and all it does it discharges all of your debts. The unexpired lease can either be accepted or rejected by the debtor or the trustee. If the lease is of value to the estate the trustee will assume it and make adequate protection payments from estate proeprty. If the lease is of no value to the estate then the trustee will abandon it and it is up to the debtor to assume or reject. The creditor does not have to allow you to assume the lease. If the lease is not accepted it is rejected by operation of law.",
        "See, also:\nhttp://www.doney.net/bkcode/11usc.htm#ch05sIII",
        "The lease should be shown on Sched G as an executory contract, the lessor as a secured creditor on Sched D, and the leased property on Sched A (if real property), or Sched B as personal prop. You would also show your intent to assume the lease or not on the Statement of Intent. If you want to assume the lease, the assumption / reaffirmation agreement must be filed within 60 days after your first meeting of creditors. The property never \"belongs\" to the debtor since it is owned by the lessor.",
        "The property of the debtor (with rare exceptions) becomes property of the estate upon filing the BK and reverts to the debtor when properly exempted and/or when abandoned (rejected) by the Trustee. At that point the debtor is free to \"reaffirm/assume\" the lease (assuming the lender agrees); but that does not mean the leased property belongs to the debtor ... only that the debtor's interest in the property is as it was before (probably more of a liability than an asset).",
        "An unexpired lease is an executory contract. Executory contracts are discussed at Section 365 of the bankruptcy code. They must be assumed by a trustee in a chapter 7 case; otherwise, they are rejected. Executory contracts in effect at the time of the bankruptcy filing are assets/liabilities of the bankruptcy estate."

    "title": "Medical debt from April, 2011 for $18k. Will it fall off credit report in 2018 BUT still impact ability to secure home loan?",
    "question": "We are trying to get pre-approved now and the broker is recommending that I set up payments on the debt and said that the collections will ALWAYS be affect my ability to get a home loan (although it will fall off my credit report). Which is also confusing since in California, the statutes for collections of medical debt is 4 years. Can they even legally require me to pay?",
    "answers": [
        "The 4 yrs you refer to is the Statute of Limitations for suing you for the debt, not collecting it.\nSince they do not have a Judgment against you, they cannot force you to pay it (but they can continue to \"ask\" for payment).\nAssuming you have not made any payments since 2011, once the debt drops off your credit report it will no longer have any impact on your creditworthiness.",
        "When you make a payment on a debt, it generally EXTENDS the time that the debt can be reported as the length of time reported is from the date of last payment, not when debt originally made. Hope this perspective helps!",
        "I am not familiar with CA laws, so you need to see a CA attorney before you do anything. If the statute of limitations to collect has passed, then it should have no impact. Once it is no longer on your credit report, the lender won't see it. I do not think you are obligated to tell them about a collection that is past the statute of limitations.\n\nBut see an attorney familiar with the \"Fair Credit Reporting Act\" first. If you make a payment it could reset the time that the credit bureaus can report the debt."

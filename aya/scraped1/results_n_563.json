    "question": "I filled for Chapter 7 Bankruptcy with an attorney. Two days ago I signed the various forms with my attorney. My attorney filed them today (Friday).",
    "answers": [
        "Yes - these errors are easily fixable; and no - they will not cause any issues for your case.\nI would not charge for amending the Petition in this case; but your attorney may feel differently since you DID \"read\" and sign the documents before they were filed with the court.",
        "The mistakes you describe do not appear to be \"material\" mistakes. Send your lawyer an email with the correct information and ask that the appropriate corrections be made, and, if necessary, signed by you. Then ask that the lawyer send you evidence of filing with the court. That should do it.",
        "It is a simple and easy fix. Have your attorney file an amendment to the petition."

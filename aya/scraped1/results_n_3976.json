        "The other attorneys' answers are correct. When is the Nevada hearing/trial? If possible you should get a consultation with counsel before that hearing-to review the evidence, possible defenses, as well as possible FDCPA violations by the collector which may still be pursued in California. On most FDCPA claims there is only a 1-year statute of limitations.",
        "Mr. Ridley and Ms Espada are both correct. Domesticating a Judgment is not difficult. Time for some asset protection and get with a lawyer who does FDC practice work and possibly consider bankruptcy.",
        "I interpret this question as one about the execution of a judgment, if the creditor gets a judgment in Nevada. Assuming that the plaintiff wins at trial and gets a judgment in a Nevada court, the creditor can take steps to execute the judgment in any state. It would be a process of filing certain documents in the court nearest to where you live. As long as the judgment is valid and enforceable in Nevada, it can be \"domesticated\" in California. Once that occurs, the creditor can pursue collection based on California Enforcement of Judgments statutes: it can place a lien on your real property, levy bank accounts and garnish your wages.\n\nI agree that you should seek the advice of an attorney who can evaluate the potential FDCPA violations, and what you could do now to prepare for an eventual case against this creditor.\n\nGood luck.",
        "My thinking - get a consultation with an attorney who does FDCPA and credit defense work. They can analyze your facts and present you a full range of options."

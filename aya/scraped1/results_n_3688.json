    "question": "Friend got into some credit card debt with relatively small balances (all under $1,500) because he was unable to keep up with payments last year. The debts discharged to collection agencies. I asked him how he was able to even get approved, as he was unemployed at the time and he said he lied about employment. I'm worried about him. Can he go to jail for this? It's bank fraud. What are the chances of him being criminally prosecuted? Is there a chance he could go to prison if he doesn't pay these off soon? I'll help him pay if that's the case.",

        "I'll cast my vote with Ms. Carter's assessment. While possible, prosecution under the circumstances you've described seems extremely remote. If the debt is in collections they will agree to a repayment plan and sometimes will negotiate as less than face value settlement. He does need to take care of the debt for the simple reason that his credit history is really important and becoming more so every day. Many employers run credit histories as part of the hiring process as do landlords and all companies who extend credit. The amount to pay down is pretty modest but it has to be accomplished on a reasonable and CONSISTENT basis.",
        "Speaking in general terms, as that is what this site is for: people who enter into signed financial agreements, and knowingly list false information, and induce others to take action based on that false information, can be prosecuted for fraud. The District Attorney in each particular jurisdiction decides what cases are worth prosecuting, which should be filed as felonies and which as misdemeanors.",
        "It is technically fraud, but I have never seen anyone charged as a result. He is better off to get it paid though. Just because it is not done does not mean it can't be done."

    "title": "Filed Chapter 7 Bankruptsy, reaffirmed my Mortgage, bank said they never received paperwork, would have to open case up?",
    "question": "Chapter 7 discharged 2011, reaffirmed mortgage, was not behind nor upside down on it. Found out today bank said they sent me paperwork to fill out for reaffirm and they never got it back. if the judge agreed to the reaffirm would that have been enough since the bank knew about it? They won't change it without opening the case up. So now it will show up on my credit report as it being in bankruptsy which I wanted to avoid. It was the hardest thing to do and now its out there like that.",

        "I agree with what the other attorneys said - particularly the attorney who said reaffirming a mortgage is almost always a bad idea. In my jurisdiction, reaffirmation agreements are disfavored in general and heavily scrutinized by the judge. Remember, it s not necessary to sign a reaffirmation agreement in order to keep your home. So long as you are current on the mortgage, the lender cannot foreclose. If you are upset that your timely mortgage payments are not appearing on the credit report, you can report these timely payments yourself by opening a dispute with each of the three credit bureaus and submitting your payment history. (you have to argue that the credit report is incorrect because it does not accurately reflect your timely payments). Then the lender will have 30 days to object and if they don't, the new payment history should be reflected. Of course you will have to keep doing this as time goes on. As far as the remark on your credit report \"discharged in bankruptcy\" - you are correct that if you executed a reaffirmation agreement and it was signed by the creditor and filed with the court, the credit report should not reflect this.\n\nI do not see how the reaffirmation agreement could have been approved if it was not signed by the creditor or your attorney. You will need to revisit the court docket to see what exactly happened, or speak to your attorney. Again, don't worry too much about this if it turns out your reaffirmation agreement was never legally filed/approved. If there really was no reaffirmation agreement, at least you will be protected from legal liability in the event there is a later judicial foreclosure sale on the property, should you no longer be able to afford the payments.\n\nAlso, please remember that signing a reaffirmation agreement for a mortgage not only creates personal liability, but can actually harm your credit score because it will result in a much higher debt to income ratio compared with the situation where the debt is considered \"discharged in bankruptcy\".",
        "You need to call your lawyer to see what was done. A reaffirmation agreement is just that - an agreement. Not just something you want and theJudge approves.

Since the period for reaffirming expired long ago in 2011, there is no do-over if there was no signed agreement.",
        "It is extremely unusual to reaffirm a mortgage in bankruptcy, almost always the pros are outweighed by the cons. However, if you did reaffirm the mortgage, you would have had to complete the reaffirmation agreement, sign it, and have it filed by the bank. Then the court would have set the matter for hearing, and the judge (if he \"agreed\") would enter an order confirming the reaffirmation agreement. It doesn't make sense that the judge would have agreed without seeing the filed reaffirmation agreement. You should speak to an attorney who can look up your docket for your case, and see whether the reaffirmation agreement was ever filed with the court. Or you could go yourself to the courthouse and ask for your case docket, and look to see if the reaffirmation agreement was filed and approved.\n\nHope this helps!",
        "This may be a blessing in disguise. Why do you think you need to reaffirm the mortgage? Just keep making the payments and you'll be fine.",
        "Since the reaffirmation agreement was signed before you received your discharge the Judge may allow the case to be reopened for the reaffirmation to go through; but the Judge may not. This depends on the Judge and your jurisdiction. If the Judge did agree to it back then you definitely have a better chance of the judge allowing the case to be reopened to reaffirm the debt. Be careful though there are many reasons why attorneys advise against reaffirming mortgage debt: you avoid personal liability for the mortgage and you have no obligation to pay. The only benefit is the one you are referring to - they report your on time payments to the credit bureaus. Would be worth talking over with your attorney that handled your Chapter 7 for you."

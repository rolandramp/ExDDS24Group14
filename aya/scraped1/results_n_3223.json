    "title": "Received a writ of execution with a pending motion to set aside judgment",
    "question": "A default judgment from Capital one was entered against me back in 2010 because I was never served. I filed a motion to set aside entry of default, the hearing is set for Oct. Today I received a Writ of Execution. I'm very confused, do I respond and try to settle or do I wait for the court date. Will they come after my bank accounts? I don't want to end up with a paid judgment on my credit reports. Thanks for any responses.",
    "answers": [
        "Did you serve the creditor's attorney (or the creditor, if they don't have an attorney) with the motion to set aside default judgment? The Writ of Execution should have been stayed by the filing of the motion. You should contact their attorney immediately to straighten this out. If the motion is granted, any money or property taken from you will have to be returned.",
        "I will defer to Shaye since she is licensed in CA, but will point out the general rule. A motion to set aside judgment doesn't, by itself, stay (prevent) enforcement of that judgment. Meaning, they can still try to collect while the motion to set aside is pending. Reason being, until there is a court order setting aside the judgment, under the law, the judgment is still valid.\n\nAbsent a law or rule specific to your state, what you need to do is file a motion to stay enforcement. How attorneys would do this is file the Motion to Set-Aside the Judgment and Motion to Stay Enforcement concurrently. However, generally, the only way to get a stay of enforcement granted is if the debtor (you) posts a bond. There is usually no \"right\" to have enforcement stayed, it is up to the judges discretion.\n\nI would be surprised if CA had such a law or rule that says that if a party to a lawsuit files a motion to set-aside/vacate a judgement, that enforcement of that judgment is stayed (stopped) while the motion is pending. But, I could be wrong.\n\nIn the big picture, I hope you win. But what evidence are you going to produce from an event that happened 4 years ago that shows you weren't served? Keep in mind, the burden of proof is on you to prove you weren't properly served. You have to rebut, with proof, what is claimed on the affidavit of service. In addition, you usually need to show that even if you were properly served, that you had a defense to the claim. So, even if you can show that you weren't properly served (a big if), you can still lose if you don't have some basis to say you don't owe the debt."

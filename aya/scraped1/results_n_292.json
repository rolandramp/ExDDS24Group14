    "title": "How does chapter 13 takes care of your unsecured debt for the following:",
    "question": "How does chapter 13 can handle my second mortgage and one judgment lien against my property, if my disposable income can only cover my first mortgages payments and arrears on my two real estate properties? After deducting misc expenses and homestead exemptions, my non exempt equity left from my properties combined is greater than those secured debts. I have two first mortgages to pay (two properties), one second mortgage and one judgment lien on one of the properties. I want to keep both properties. I don't have unsecured debts or priority debts. Unfortunately my disposable income can only cover the first mortgages of those two properties. My elder mother lives at the other property. My main question is how do I pay for the second mortgage and judgment lien without enough disposable income and too much nonexempt equity during chapter 13? Please advice. Thank you.",

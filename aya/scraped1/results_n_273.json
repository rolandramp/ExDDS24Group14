    "question": "I have taken a personal loan on a business credit card. My income has reduced by 2/3rd due to the reduction of my employment. Additionally, I don't own the business anymore. It was sold many years ago. Can my assets or home be impacted and/or considered if I file bankruptcy? Which type of bankruptcy I should file?",

        "If you're talking about personal obligations you have from a prior business, then your personal obligations would be part of your personal bankruptcy. Not enough facts are available to discuss your options and what assets are impacted, but these types of issues can usually be discussed in through a free consultation.",
        "Q: Am I able to file bankruptcy on a business that has been sold?\nThis question makes no sense. A person does not file bankruptcy on a business (assuming that by \"business\" you mean a corporation or partnership, and not a sole proprietorship). A corporation/business can file bankruptcy itself, in either Chapter 11 or Chapter 7, depending on the facts and circumstances and what needs to be accomplished.\n\nQ: I have taken a personal loan on a business credit card. My income has reduced by 2/3rd due to the reduction of my employment. Additionally, I don't own the business anymore. It was sold many years ago. Can my assets or home be impacted and/or considered if I file bankruptcy?\nSo I think what you are saying here is that you have personal liability on an old business debt (although it's not clear--I don't know how you take a \"personal loan\" on a business card). You are either liable for the debt, or you're not. If you are, then you can file a bankruptcy and--assuming the debt was not incurred through fraud or other basis excepted from discharge under The Bankruptcy Code--discharge the debt.\n\nQ: Which type of bankruptcy I should file?\nI assume you mean which Chapter of bankruptcy should you file? That can only be answered after an analysis of your entire situation (value of your assets, types of debts, income, expenses, goals, etc.) by an experienced bankruptcy attorney. There are many factors to consider and all the relevant factors must be reviewed before determining your best option.",
        "I agree with colleagues and add:\nYes. You may include debts related to personal guarantees of closed bueiness in your personal BK.\nBK is complicated and has lasting, sometimes unintended, consequences.\nConsult BK counsel to review speciifics, strategy, types of BK relief, your qualifications to file.",
        "I suspect that your personally guaranteed some of the business debt or took out personal debt which you used on this business. You can file personal bankruptcy to get rid of this debt. Whether you should depends on a number of factors. I suggest that you avail your self of a free consult with a bankruptcy lawyer who can review all the facts and suggest the proper course of action to you.",
        "Your question does not make sense but, no, you can't file bankruptcy \"on\" a business you do not own. It appears your real issue is whether you need to file for personal Bankruptcy. What might be impacted and what type you should file can be answered by contacting 2-3 good Bankruptcy lawyers in your area."

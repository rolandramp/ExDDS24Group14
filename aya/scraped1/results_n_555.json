        "In addition to the avenues of discovery listed by my colleague, there's Title 18 of the United States Code, and specifically Section 152. It makes it a felony to conceal assets, give false oaths, or file false declarations. To punish persons willing to take that chance, those who are caught face a fine of up to $500,000, five years in federal prison, or both. Federal prisoners don't get their sentences reduced for good behavior; good behavior is expected of inmates.\n\nDiscovery of the existence of a trust that, at minimum, was created by the trustor, is managed by a trustee, and has one or more beneficiaries, and perhaps files federal tax returns, doesn't take a rocket scientist. Since felons who commit bankruptcy claims are prosecuted by the Department of Justice, its investigation tools include the FBI. The FBI can get tax returns of trusts. Think of all the facts about which you alone know.\n\nMany appellate decisions start of with the preface that 'Bankruptcy relief, and the clean slate and fresh start it offers, is for the honest but unfortunate debtor. Woe be unto the dishonest debtor'. The oath debtors take to tell the truth is the cornerstone of a body of law that protects millions. Those who misuse it deserve the five years of incarceration and $500,000 fine.",
        "In addition to hiring an investigator, remember that sometimes, details of how someone intended to leave property can’t be kept entirely private—whether you use a will or a living trust to handle your affairs. For example,\n---Terms of the trust, if state law requires disclosure to relatives. Many states require that if you leave a living trust, the trustee, after your death, must give a copy to the beneficiaries (people who inherit trust property) if they request it. In some states, beneficiaries only get to see the part of the document that pertains to them—but in others, they can see the whole thing, which means that one beneficiary may be able to see what all the others are inheriting, too. And in some states, the trustee must notify certain close relatives—usually defined as the people who would inherit under state law in the absence of a will—about the trust after your death, and give them a copy if they request it.\n---Real estate ownership. Who owns real estate is always a matter of public record. Anyone can look up a particular parcel of real estate in the local land records office (often called the county recorder or registry of deeds, depending on where you live) and find out who owns it. (Often, other information is also available, such as the amount of property taxes paid each year.) So once your real estate has been transferred to the person who inherits it, it will be a matter of public record.\n---Lawsuits. If you leave a living trust and a disgruntled relative sues over your estate, the trust document will probably become part of the public record of the lawsuit. These kinds of suits are rare, however, and usually crop up only when offspring who are expecting an inheritance are left with nothing or almost nothing. So unless you think someone has reason to strongly object to your estate plan, you probably don’t need to worry about a court battle after your death.",

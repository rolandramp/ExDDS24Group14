        "Most likely the court set this date and not the creditor. If you think the court erred and didn't correctly set the date I would file an objection pointing out the error. If you have filed your Notice of Claim of Exemption and the creditor didn't file the WG-09 and WG-010 to oppose the exemption the court will likely grant your request -- if they have filed this, then the court will hold the hearing to determine the issues between the parties and make a ruling. If you can't afford to be garnished and have other debts you may consider consulting a bankruptcy attorney about your options.\n\nTake a look at the link below for a walk-through on the collection process.

    "title": "Received Summons for credit card debt in California",
    "question": "I received a summons from Portfolio Recovery Associates, LLC yesterday. It is for a credit card issued by US Bank. The summons says PRA, LLC purchased the debt from US Bank. They are seeking $9,300 and 10 percent per year since 2012. I stopped making payments almost two years ago because I could no longer afford to make them. I had made a payment by taking it into the bank. A few days later I got a call from US Bank saying I paid it late and they were increasing the interest rate. The payment nore then doubled. My wages (realtor) had gone way down. I had lost three homes and was not able to pay other debts. What I could afford (including another Credit Card with US Bank) I have been paying. I am trying to decide what to do with this summons. I am lost and in need of advice.",

        "The purpose of the lawsuit for the creditor is to obtain a judgment so they can escalate their collection efforts since voluntary ways have proved fruitless. The creditor is entitled to 10% interest on a judgment. You can of course answer the summons but if in fact you owe the debt and the statute of limitation to sue you has not expired there really is no defense. Without knowing more about financial situation, income, living expenses, other assets it's difficult to say what you should do. Generally speaking filing Bankruptcy to take care of a $9,300 in debt is probably overkill but you mention that you have other debts. Depending on types and amounts of these debts perhaps bankruptcy is something worth considering and following up with a consultation with a bankruptcy attorney to learn how it works and if you want to take that route. Other ideas on how to deal with this is: attempt a settlement, but of course you need to have something to bring to the negotiating table. Sometimes people can borrow from elsewhere or liquidate some assets. Typically 60% settlement is quite doable. It gets harder the lower the amount you can propse. The other is option is to propose a repayment, again only doable if it's something you can afford to do. The purpose of the lawsuit will be to levy bank accounts, record a lien so it can attach to any real estate property you own and garnish wages. If you are self-employed, as most realtors are, there is no wages to garnish however your bank account(s) could be levied any time after the creditor receives a judgment. Other solutions? Lower expenses and/or increase income. Slap to head, why didn't I think of that, right? Most bankruptcy attorneys offer a free consultation.",
        "If you're asking if you have a defense? Not really but if you fight it and do discovery some of these junk debt buyers simply give in.",
        "Since you put this question in the Bankruptcy practice area as well, perhaps you're wondering if it's dischargeable ... even after they get their default judgment. The answer is yes. The real questions are: what is your gross family monthly income and how much additional debt do you have besides the 9,300?",
        "You must answer the summons and defend, or risk them taking a default, which will then accrue interest at 10%, as well as permitting PRA to garnish your wages or levy your bank accounts. This is not the time to bury your head, for any reason. Get a consultation with a debt attorney right away. Also, PRA and the other players here may have, or may in the future, commit violations of the applicable statutes. Your attorney will educate you about your rights and options. I suggest checking the National Association of Consumer Advocates website (naca.net) for a good consumer attorney."

    "title": "What reasons can a bankruptcy filing be sealed",
    "question": "I plan of filing a chaptet 7 bk. I wanted to know what reasons if any would a judge or clerk approve the case being sealed from the public.",
    "answers": [
        "I agree that you can't file the entire petition under seal. For example, In San Diego, rule 9018 allows you to file\n\"secret, confidential, scandalous,or defamatory documents\" under seal.",
        "It would take something pretty extraordinary, because your creditors have a right to see when you file for bankruptcy, and so do banks and other places you apply for credit - and it needs to be on your credit report for fairness to everyone.",
        "The bankruptcy records are public, and remain so as part of the federal court system.\n\nSealing cases is generally only available in family law matters where there is a high level of personal information in the case, or it concerns the children or other similar issues. This is not the case in bankruptcy proceedings.",
        "I am only aware of sealing information such as a trade secret, or sealing an address because you had to obtain a restraining order against someone for domestic violence. I am sure there are other extenuating circumstances in which information may be sealed, but keep in mind that it's the information that is being sealed, not the filing of the case. Generally, a bankruptcy case does not have any information sealed. If you're worried about identity theft, your full social security number will only appear on one document, which is not accessible to the public. All other documents requiring your SSN will only show the last four numbers.\n\nIf the reason you are asking is because you just don't want your friends or family from knowing you filed bankruptcy, there is no way to seal the fact that your filed or the information that was filed. However, note that most filer's friends and family never even know they have filed, unless the filer told them or the filer's friend/family member is required to receive notice of the filing (i.e. they are a creditor). Also, the information is not just floating on the internet - they would need to have PACER account, which most people don't have because they don't use it. Good luck to you!",
        "A bankruptcy filing is a public record, with the exception of your SS Number. I know of no reason that a judge would agree to seal the records related to a bankruptcy filing.",
        "Generally, it can't be sealed. They have revamped the process so your SSN can't be stolen and also to hide children's names. One of the requirements is full disclosure of assets, income, and debts in a way that creditors can examine."

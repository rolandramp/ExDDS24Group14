    "title": "How to quash subpoena for spousal records in annulment of marriage",
    "question": "Spouse is demanding annulment in a short term marriage while at the same time issuing subpoenas to banks for spouses bank statements. Cannot the subpoena be objected/quashed for the reason that the party demanding annulment does not need access to the financial records of the spouse as annulment will not have any financial bifurcation of assets or debts on the marriage or similar reason.",
    "answers": [
        "Even if a spouse is seeking an annulment, that spouse may claim to be a \"putative spouse\", and to have financial rights arising from the marriage. If you try to object to a subpena on the basis that the case is an annulment, you'll lose, and if your ex has an attorney, and files a motion to compel compliance with the subpena, then you'll very possibly end up paying that attorney's fees for the motion.\n\nIf you don't want to hire a lawyer, that's your business, but doing your own legal work is almost always a bad idea.",
        "If an attorney answers you honestly s/he will say you need input. We know you won't like it.\n\nWe won't get paid. You seem to think we should not even get the usual reward.\n\nThis is not a winning formula. Good luck",
        "Then go to law school, take the bar exam, learn your local rules, and apply all of that to your specific situation. Otherwise, You should find a local attorney and get advice based on a more detailed conversation. There are too many factors to consider to provide you better guidance."

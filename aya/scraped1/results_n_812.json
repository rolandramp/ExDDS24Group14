    "answers": [
        "Your post petition chapter 7 income is not property of the estate. If I understand your fact pattern you now have 2 jobs. The job when you filed bankruptcy and a new job that you are in training for. You don't state that you are receiving income from the new job, only that employment is contingent upon passing an exam sometime in the future, when your training is complete. Amending Schedule I does not incur a filing fee so you can amend, I don't know that you have to amend. If your creditors meeting has not occurred then you can mention to the Trustee to see if an amendment is necessary.",
        "The recommendations of both my distinguished colleagues are correct. You must fully disclose everything. You should retain a Bankruptcy attorney.\nTo properly answer your questions and address your concerns, the best way to handle this is with an in person consultation with an experienced CA bankruptcy attorney. Use AVVO's Find a Lawyer tool to select a qualified attorney. Good luck. THIS IS NOT LEGAL ADVICE! YOU NEED TO SPEAK TO AN ATTORNEY WHO IS LICENSED IN YOUR STATE FOR LEGAL ADVICE. This is merely suggestions for you to think about in discussing your situation with the local attorney.",
        "Generally, you take a snap shot of your financial circumstances as of the petition filing date. Under Schedule I of your petition it does ask if you anticipate an increase or decrease in your income in the upcoming year. As you do not have the new job yet, you would be ok listing your income as it is now, however, you might wish to mention at the bottom of schedule I that you are in training and hope to get a better paying position upon passing the exam, etc... Unless you are talking about a substantial change in income to the better, that probably is not going to be an issue in your Chapter 7 filed now. Actually, the means test provisions of the 2005 Bankruptcy Law change, specifically stated you are to look at the last six months average income to determine if you qualify for Chapter 7. Definitely speak with your attorney about this and I am they can advise you on amending the forms, etc... Good Luck.",
        "Amend to show the new job and salary on schedule I and not at the bottom of Schedule I that the job is contingent on you passing an exam."

    "title": "Bankruptcy / Chapter 7 - \"No assets\", what are the chances that a Trustee will look or overlook bankruptcy fraud?",
    "question": "Debtor did not list foreign assets, foreign business, undervalued property and currently selling the undervalued supposedly \"exempt property\", considered pets or livestock?",
    "answers": [
        "If the trustee finds out about the foreign assets, businesses and undervalued property, the chances are good that she will report the attempted bk fraud to the US Trustee who will investigate and refer it to the US Attorney for bankruptcy crime prosecution. Bankruptcy fraud is taken very seriously, and rightfully so, in order to make sure that only honest but unfortunate debtors get relief.",
        "Fraud is a very serious issue in bankruptcy there is no time limit for then court to chase if your documents were not truthful. Any time that would be limited begins at the time the fraud should be discovered which is the department of justice uses to show that it would not be possible to find earlier. Bear in mind fraud is when it's done intentionally and not accidentally. Many factors are to be considered up to and including the value of the asset.",
        "In looking at bankruptcy fraud, timing is crucial. The UST will often give a debtor multiple opportunities to come clean, as many people that file bankruptcy are not good at managing their finances and fail to provide accurate & complete information. Once the deadline passes to make corrections, and after giving the debtor ample opportunity to correct, expect the blade of the guillotine to fall swiftly. An entire department of the bankruptcy system has been set up to prosecute bankruptcy criminals and the folks working in this department love the publicity they get from prosecutions. Search for the phrase Real Housewifes of New Jersey Teresa Giudice's prison sentence for more information. Hope this perspective helps!",
        "If a petition and schedules are filed as a \"no asset\" Chapter 7 case, and if the panel trustee later finds assets, the panel trustee will file turnover actions to get possession of the assets. The trustee will then begin the process of liquidating those assets through a court order. The panel trustee will then refer the case to the U.S. Trustee, and the U.S. Trustee will request a criminal investigation from the U.S. Attorney in the district. These types of cases end up with assets sold, and then creditors will be directed to file claims against the bankruptcy estate. The debtors in these types of cases will be prosecuted, and will generally end up serving time in a federal prison.",
        "Trustee will look at the entire case and fraud will be looked at very seriously by the court, U.S. Trustees office and the DOJ for Federal investigation.",
        "Your question seems to ask illegal advice/opinion not legal. Any attorney who will prepare the bankruptcy petition will not intentionally fail to disclose any assets and debts of the debtor, and will alway presume that trustee will not overlook anything."

    "title": "Is it possible to transfer the judgment from one person to another person? My ex-husband supposed to be the judgment debtor.",
    "question": "My sister's husband (my brother-in-law) leased an office for my ex-husband in the past for my ex-husband's small business after he filed a bankruptcy. Due to the continuous late-rental payments to the landlord, they've ordered marshal to lock him out and filed law suit against my brother-in-law for the remaining lease terms. The landlord got award with the judgment and they are starting collection activities against my brother-in-law, and my ex-husband is being irresponsible to pay even though he was the leased tenant. My ex-husband is willing to accept their collection activities which can include garnishing his earnings and ruining his credit. I really cannot let that happen to my sister's family; all they had done was just trying to help my ex-husband at that time when I was w/him.",

        "No. The court entered a judgment against your brother in law. The landlord would not have leased the premises without your brother in law being responsible. All that your brother in law can do is to sue your ex-h for indemnification. If the b in law obtains a judgment, he can collect from the ex-h.",
        "Unfortunately since your brother-in-law is the named lease holder, the judgment against him is valid and the only way for the landlord to collect. Your brother-in-law could file suit against your ex-husband if there was an agreement amongst them that the ex-husband would pay but enforcing that agreement seems unlikely. There is no way to transfer the judgment. The leaseholder has done what he is supposed to do here and unless ex-husband decides to pay up your brother-in-law will be held responsible.",
        "Only the court can make authorize this. Essentially, the plaintiff (landlord) would dismiss your brother in law and add your ex-husband. Since your ex-husband was not party to the case originally, he will need to be served with the lawsuit and given the opportunity to respond to the lawsuit, before any judgment can validly apply. He will have the defense that he was not on the contract, which may mean the landlord cannot get a judgment against him. Thus, the outcome you desire is unlikely to occur, because then the landlord would get nothing for the unpaid rent.\n\nYour brother in law should consult with an experienced debt collection defense attorney to get this resolved and behind him. The judgment presently hangs over his head, making him unable to buy any real estate, refinance a home he may own, and always worried that the collection attorney will levy the funds in his bank account or garnish his wages with this unpaid judgment. The judgment can last for many years, even decades, until satisfied.\n\nBy: Robert Stempler (please see DISCLAIMER below)\nCONSUMER LAW OFFICE OF ROBERT STEMPLER\nA Professional Law Corporation"

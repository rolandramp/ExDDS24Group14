    "title": "Mom passed recently. She had a reverse mortgage on house. Do I have to go through probate to sell house?",
    "question": "She used $200,000 and house worth about $230,000. Do you consider the total amount of what the house is worth or the amount the estate will acquire to compute the $100,000 limit of an estate when determining whether you have to go through probate. There isn't much else of value to consider.",
    "answers": [
        "The threshold for probate is based on gross numbers. So yes, probate is necessary and the probate fee will be based on the date of death value. The statutory attorneys fee will be roughly $7,600. Filing fees is $435. Also, the threshold for avoiding probate on real property is $50,000.",
        "As Mr. Perry indicated you do use the gross value in determining if you need to do a full probate or not. In fact, the limit is now $150k and takes into account all assets that are not in trust, have a beneficiary or have a joint owner. Thus bank accounts would also be included. Also, if there are other assets, such as bank accounts, you won't be able to use probate code 13100 small estate affidavits since there is this real estate. You are going to be thin on equity but based on the facts you present a good attorney should be able to at least get you an administrator's fee (about $7k) out of this house. That is, get $7,000 into your pocket! Good luck. -John",
        "Unfortunately, you must use the gross value of the estate, and not the net. If the house was not in a trust where a successor trustee has the power to sell, or the property does pass to someone by operation of law outside of probate, then a probate proceeding will be necessary.",
        "You need to have a probate attorney in the state where she died review the deed and mortgage documents and any estate documents. If the deed was in her name alone then you may need to raise an estate just to deal with the situation. Of course, it maybe more prudent to walk away if there are a lot of debts."

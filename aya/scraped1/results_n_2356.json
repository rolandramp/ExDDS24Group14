    "answers": [
        "Gambling debt, without something further, is dischargeable in bankruptcy just like credit cards or medical bills. Sometimes gambling debt - particularly if done with cash advances or just before bankruptcy filing - does raise issues of fraud, which could result in gambling debt being nondischargeable (meaning that the debt would still be owed after the bankruptcy). Whether your spouse's gambling debt fits in that framework is a very fact-specific analysis, so the best thing you and your significant other can do is to set up one or more consultations with local, experienced attorneys that can evaluate all the facts and give you a road map for further action. Best of luck to you.",
        "While I did not see an actual question, I believe you are concerned about whether your wife's gambling debt is dischargeable in bankruptcy. Absent actual fraud, the answer is \"yes.\" In over 36 years I have wiped out millions of dollars of gambling debt, even in one case where the casino hired bankruptcy attorneys to fight my client getting the debt discharged. I would recommend you seek advice from an attorney who has been specializing in bankruptcy for many years.\n\nDo yourself a huge favor and see a quality bankruptcy attorney to find out what can be done for you and what is protected. Your case would be filed in the Bankruptcy Court in Sacramento. I would recommend you find a quality bankruptcy attorney by looking at Avvo's ratings for Sacramento attorneys.\n\nYou could also look at the CA State bar website for a Certified Bankruptcy Law Specialist in Sacramento. Most attorneys will give you are free initial consultation. I have provided a link to the state bar below.\n\nAnother potential source for finding a good attorney would be through a search of the National Association of Consumer Bankruptcy Attorneys (NACBA.org) to find a good local attorney.

It apparently does not accept advertising from attorneys. I have included the link below.\n\nNo matter how good an attorney is rated, if you are not comfortable with the attorney when you meet, move on to another attorney. Also, if the attorney uses a paralegal to do the initial appointment, move on because you are just a number and a dollar sign. If this is how you are treated when they are trying to get your money, you can be certain it is not going to get better after they get your money.\n\nDo NOT use an attorney that does anything other than bankruptcy law, foreclosure or debt negotiation. Part-time bankruptcy attorneys are, sadly, almost never expert enough to do the job right. This is a specialized field and you should go with an attorney who practices solely in that specialty. Never hire to veterinarian's assistant to do brain surgery on you and never hire a non-specialist to do a specialists job. Get the right attorney to begin with.\n\nI hope this helps you.",
        "I agree with the other answers, but here's a potential way to deal with this that is not often used, and not understood by creditors:\n\nFile the bankruptcy case by yourself without your wife\n\nYou will both benefit from the discharge you get, in that your wife's creditors cannot go after any community property assets UNLESS they timely file an objection to the discharge of her debts in YOUR bankruptcy case.

        "Hope that debt is owed to the native American casinos, and not to the casinos across state lines, because a casino marker owed in Nv can be a criminal offense - same as a bad check. Hope this perspective helps.",
        "There is always an issue when gambling debt is involved. I used to practice in Sacramento and Rancho and was always an issue for those that traveled to Tahoe etc. Try to wait as long as possible before filing from the last time you borrowed money from a casino / cash advance. If you can put off the filing for at least 6 month that should help. that is, increase your odds the creditor will not object to your discharge. You absolutely need to seek legal counsel on this issue. I strongly suggest you consult with a lawyer affiliated with AVVO."

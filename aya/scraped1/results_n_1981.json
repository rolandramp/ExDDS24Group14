    "title": "Can I change my mind and do a redemption instead of reaffirming the car?",
    "question": "I was at the reaffirmation hearing and found out I can have my car redeemed. Since I owe a lot more than my car's worth, I want to try this option. What's the deadline for me to do this? Do I just rescind the reaffirmation and then file a motion to redeem?",
    "answers": [
        "I'm not sure if you've actually reaffirmed on the debt or indicated on your statement of intentions you intend to reaffirm. If the latter, you don't have to recind anything, just contact the creditor and tell them your intention has changed and try to negotiate a fair price and time for payment. If they won't agree to a reasonable price, file a motion to redeem.",
        "I concur with my colleagues and add the following: If possible, negotiate a redemption value with the creditor in advance. If they are being unreasonable, the court will decide on a value.",
        "Unless the court has approved the reaffirmation, you certainly can take the steps to obtain a redemption instead. Unless you have the cash in your pocket to pay for redemption, you probably will need to find financing first. Next step will be to get the appraisal, the estimate of any repairs to bring the vehicle up to appraisal standards, and to file the motion to redeem. Hope this perspective helps!",
        "Yes, you can still do that if your case has not been discharged yet. However, you should not rescind until you have the motion to redeem ready and do both at the same time. Even though you only have to notify the creditor that you are rescinding, you should file a copy of the rescission letter with the court also.\n\nOur judge will sign an order that gives you 30 days to pay the full balance to redeem. However the amount of time given your judge could vary, some require that you have the ability to redeem on the same date as the hearing. Please note that the value that is to be used per ยง 722 is the replacement value of the vehicle."

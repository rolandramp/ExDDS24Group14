    "title": "Accidentally received a large overpayment of UI insurance money.",
    "question": "I was off work on disability and was receiving automatic payments. I returned to work and tried calling EDD several times but getting these people to answer the phone is almost impossible. EDD has paid me $1,000 I am probably ineligible for. This wasn't intentional on my part and I was wondering if I should get a lawyer to contact them on my behalf to avoid incriminating myself. This was a one time overpayment and I'm a bit worried about how to let them know of this overpayment due to the presumption of fraud. I didn't have any fraudulent intent , the situation was that I was on automatic payments. I returned to work early. In the past, I've received claim forms from EDD and would actively communicate with them by reporting information on claim forms. I have not received any such claim forms thus far. In this situation I received an automatic payment that I probably shouldn't have received. Also, would it be possible to discharge this in Chapter 7 bankruptcy ?? I was about to file since I owe about $30,000 in medical debt and have horrible credit ...",

        "I think you can discharge this debt. I don't think that the EDD is going to file an adversarial over $1,000, and I am not sure they can prove fraudulent intent on your part. Go or the seven. Worst case you will have to pay back the $1,000 and you could probably do that with a payment plan.",
        "Generally, EDD and CUIAB would have administrative remedies to help with your situation. An employment attorney should be able to help you navigate those options.\n\nA bankruptcy may also help with your situation. Generally, there will be a bankruptcy attorney who will provide a free consultation to discuss you debt concerns.",
        "I agree with my colleagues. And I strongly recommend that you consult with counsel further - particularly in light of the financial issues you mention. I did have a client that received EDD overpayment and it was discharged in a chapter 7 case. Obviously, each case is different.",
        "In a chapter 7, debt that is incurred as a result of a misrepresentation that was relied upon by the creditor is nondischargeable and debt that is incurred under fraudulent means. However, a creditor must file a complaint to determine dischargeability of debt in an adversary proceeding (AP) with court cost of $350. If the matter is not settled, the court must hold that the debtor had the duty to to report the change in circumstances and that the fact that he/she failed to report the information is sufficient to find that the failure to report constitutes a misrepresentation or constitutes actual fraud and the debt is nondischargeable.\n\nIn our jurisdiction, the MDES files APs based upon the debtor's failure to report that he/she returned to work resulting in an over payment of unemployment benefits being paid to the debtor and the debtor kept and spent the money knowing that he/she was over paid. The bankruptcy courts in our state have found this failure to report and retention of the over payment was nondischargeable. Because, we have the United States Postal Service and email and because you are not required to spend the over payment, a defense that the debtor tried to call them and could not reach anyone is not going to be a successful defense in our jurisdiction.\n\nAnother situation has occurred similar to your situation in which an AP was filed alleging an insurance payment to the debtors was nondischargeable. This has happened when a debtor receives insurance proceeds that were assigned to a hospital or to doctors, and the debtor retains the insurance proceeds knowing that the money was supposed to be paid to the hospital or doctor. I am aware of numerous cases similar to this in which the hospital or doctor was granted nondischargeable judgment against the debtor.\n\nBecause the amount you owe is fairly low, the company may not file an AP. However, if the company elects to file the AP, you could also be responsible for the court costs and the company's attorney's fees.\n\nCourts in different circuits (for example you are in the Ninth Circuit and I practice in the Fifth Circuit) may hold differently. Thus, the best way to answer your question is to take advantage of a free initial consultation with an experienced bankruptcy attorney that handles chapter 7 and chapter 13 cases even if you think you need to file under chapter 7. Become educated on all the issues involved and related to your current economic situation, find out the advantages and disadvantages for filing under each chapter and use an attorney that can help you make the right decision for you. Most bankruptcy attorneys will meet with you at no charge for the initial appointment. You can use the Avvo \"Find a Lawyer\" link at the top of this page to search for an attorney."

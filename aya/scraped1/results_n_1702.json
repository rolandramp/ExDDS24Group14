    "title": "Plan base is now $0 3 yrs into 5yr plan. All secured claims all paid. Unsecured claims confirmed at $0. Will they get paid?",
    "question": "I have a 5 year schedule. The plan confirmed with all secured and priority debts paid over the 5 year plan and all unsecured claims get 0%. Simple enough. here is where im confused. I had a mortgage listed in the original plan that was confirmed and the trustee was informed I was going to walk from it and let it foreclose. the plan confirmed with the mortgage in it and now since the mortgage is foreclosed the plan base is now $00.00. Some of the unsecured creditors filed a claim but the plan confirmed to $0 to unsecured and now the ncd database is showing my case as review Z and plan base zero? Are my payments over? The trustee has 4 payments that are on hand and not being disbursed. Will I continue to pay the remaining of the 5 year plan even if all confirmed claims were paid?",

        "I agree more info is needed but the issue is whether you were above median income as determined by the means test at the time you filed your case or were you below median income. If you were above the Applicable Commitment Period is 60 months from filing and yes you will have to continue to pay your regular plan payment until 60 months have passed. If you were below median at the time your case was filed then your applicable commitment period was 36 months and your case should discharge and close once the plan base has been satisfied. If you have an attorney, ask your attorney. If not, the trustee may be able to answer what comes next.",
        "More information is needed to give you useful advice. In a 5 yr Plan, you commit all your surplus budget income, including tax refunds, to the trustee. If you finish early, it suggests some of your creditors did not file a claim. I suspect the trustee will start paying unsecured creditors who filed claims. If none filed claims, you may be done. Did you use a lawyer in your 13? If so, ask your lawyer these questions.",
        "Your answer depends upon whether you are an above median or below median debtor. Above and you must continue in your plan for the five years in most jurisdictions unless you pay 100% to unsecured claims. If you do that, then you can finish early. I have heard that some judges will allow a plan to finish a few months early without paying 100% on unsecured claims. That is not the norm.\n\nIf you are below median, then you should be able to file a motion to modify shortening the plan to any number of months provided, the number of months is not less than 36 months. That would be allowed in our jurisdiction.",
        "The form plan in Sacramento provides for a minimum payment to unsecured creditors. The creditors can be paid more if certain claims are unpaid. So in your case, because the mortgage foreclosed and is no longer getting payments from your case, those funds are available to the unsecured creditors and they will recieve more than the minimum.\nYou need to talk to your bankruptcy attorney, or if you don't have one consult with one to determine your options at this point. You may not have to remain the the case for 5 years, but it depends upon the specific facts of your case."

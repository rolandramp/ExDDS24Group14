        "The contents of a safe-deposit box is vulnerable to creditors who have judgments, the same way that a checking or savings account is vulnerable. The creditor simply needs to know where the property is and follow the correct steps for execution of a bank levy. Once the law enforcement officer has the necessary paperwork and fee, a notice is sent to the bank, and there would be a period where the property is not available to you. You'd have to respond by filing a claim of exemption or some other action to avoid turnover of property (i.e., bankruptcy). Consult with a debt collection attorney if you are in this situation.",
        "Strictly speaking, it is the \"contents\" of the safe deposit box that \"may\" be fair game. A creditor with a judgment could obtain a write of attachment for the contents of a safe deposit box. At which point, the debtor would need to go to court (the court that issued the garnishment ) and claim an exemption if an exemption would apply to the contents. If no exemption applies, then the contents are turned over to the creditor.\n\nHowever, I am with Robert...just deal with the \"REAL\" problem, resolve the debt.

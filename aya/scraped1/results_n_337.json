        "Yes. Court costs and attorney fees simply become part of the claim, and like the claim, are dischargeable. Inclusion in the judgment simply eliminates the disputed nature of the claim, since once adjudicated by a court, the claim is no longer disputed. If you are contemplating a bankruptcy, you may wish to move forward expeditiously, since a judgment gives the judgment creditor the option of seeking issuance of an abstract of judgment, which can be recorded in the county recorder's office. If that occurs, a judicial lien is created on any real property of mine own in that county. While liens are sometimes avoidable using the bankruptcy process, it is better to prevent their creation in the first place, sort of like you \"cut 'em off at the pass\".",
        "Yes, even if you file the bankruptcy petition as soon as judgment is entered but before attorney fees are determined by the court, the attorney fees awarded as costs are pre-petition debt because the \"claim\" for fees arose before the filing of the bankruptcy petition.",
        "Generally speaking, civil judgments and legal fees related to credit cards are dischargeable. But if the lawsuit included claims such as fraud, then the debt *might* be non-dischargeable. The creditor would have to object to the dischargeability of the debt by filing an adversary proceeding to determine dischargeability of the debt.

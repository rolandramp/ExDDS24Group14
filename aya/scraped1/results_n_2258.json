    "title": "How can a trust be bolstered to protect an estate from a potential future spouse when the Trustor/Settlor is incapacitated.",
    "question": "Mother and sole living trustor/settlor is incapacitated (due to dementia/early Alzheimer's with two licensed physicians declaring this diagnosis). The designated successor settlor has taken over routine management of the trust and assets. The the trust is now irrevocable. Mother has indicated she is lonely and wants to remarry. Now she has started seeing someone who is less than ideal. What measures can be taken to protect the assets and the trust from a possible future marriage? Will the debts of the future spouse fall on the Mother's assets and/or estate?",
    "answers": [
        "If mother is incapacitated and her trust is irrevocable, there is not much that can be done with the trust at this point, If mother is incapacitated, it is doubtful that she has the abiililty to enter into a contractual agreement (pre nuptial, etc) or even marriage. Marriage is a contractual arrangement. Debts of a future spouse are obligations of the future spouse. I suggest that you contact an estate attorney to discuss this situation,. You may need a guardianship that spells out what mother is not allowed to do. Generally, trusts are less restribtive alternatives to guardianship but when someone wants to marry, things get difficult and guardianships may be necessary. Good luck,.",
        "It's somewhat difficult to respond to your question because it's hard to discern who the relevant parties are and their roles are. I think in some places you are referring to the Trustee when you say Settlor. Like most situations involving a trust, the trust document should lay out the rights and responsibilities of the parties upon death and/or incapacity of a settlor. Some trusts may require a prenuptial agreement in the event of the remarriage of the surviving spouse, have postponement of distribution provisions that can be exercised under certain circumstances, or otherwise limit access of the trust funds for the surviving spouse which sometimes helps avoid dissipation of assets due to remarriage. It all depends on the terms of the trust document and the intent of the settlor(s). I'm not sure what your role is in this process, but if you are a party with a sufficient interest in the trust, you should consult an attorney in your area to better assess the terms of the trust and what (if anything) may be done to protect the assets for the beneficiaries.",
        "Some questions are just too \"big\" to be answered here. I would encourage you to find a local trust/estate attorney. All of what you want to accomplish can be done. But paying for a few hours of research/advice will be money will spent on this one. You need to protect the assets, but remember that your mother is still the primary beneficiary. So, the trustees \"work\" for her, pursuant to her wishes presumably prior to the physician diagnosis. You need to know if the trust is ironclad, and talk through possibilities, liabilities, and strategies. I can think of a thousand questions, and I haven't even seen the documents! Cheers and good luck."

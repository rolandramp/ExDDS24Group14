    "title": "Ex-spouse will not allow to sell house",
    "question": "I have been divorced for more than 2 years. In the marital settlement agreement, deed was transferred to my name in lieu of me taking over all credit card debts. Ex-spouse does not work, so I let her stay in the house. Want to sell house so I can settle the debts. Ex says won't allow any showing to sell the house. What recourse do I have?",
    "answers": [
        "I agree with attorney Straus. A review of your judgment, marital settlement agreement, and any post-judgment order is necessary. It appears that you are not ordered to allow wife to live there and, if that appearance is fact, you are her landlord and can utilize your rights under the Cal. Civil Code to enter and show the property to prospective buyers and give her 30-days notice to vacate and thereafter utilize your rights under the Cal. Code of Civil Procedure to evict her through an unlawful detainer action.",
        "I suggest you bring your MSA to a local attorney. If the MSA deeded the house in your name, then it is your house and you need to give her a 60 days notice to vacate and then you can evict her if she doesn't leave. We you say you let her stay in the house, what does that mean? Is that part of the MSA? Also, who drafted the MSA? It matters because all ambiguities go against the person who drafted it. That includes his or her agent or attorney.",
        "If the house was deeded to you, you can ask the court for exclusive use and possession with a request to have the house listed.",
        "Tough one. Does the order have a sales provision? If so, in theory you can enforce it. (In practice, it's not so easy.)\n\nIf you own the house, you can evict the tenant. (If she is a paying tenant that may not be so smart.)\n\nIf you can get a HELOC, you can use that money to pay of the debts.\n\nIn short--there is no easy answer, and there are not quite enough facts here."

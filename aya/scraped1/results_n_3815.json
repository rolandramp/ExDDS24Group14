    "question": "By applying several credit cards on his own name and not paying for them, my husband accumulated huge credit card debts. The court awarded each party the debts post separation. The court also awarded me our residence (the house). How do I file the form FL-345 so that his credit card companies will not able to put liens on the house and ask me to pay his debts?

        "It looks like the FL-345 is part of the family law judgment. Your going to need a family law attorney to help you through that process.\n\nTo protect the real estate, what you need to do is get the house out of his name before any of the creditors obtain a judgment and record an abstract that attaches to the property.\\\n\nIf there is equity in the home that is worth protecting, it is worth hiring counsel to help protect it."

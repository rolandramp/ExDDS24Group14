        "Retain an attorney to settle the debts for you, or attempt to, and then the next time they call tell them you retained the attorney, or the attorney will let them know, and if they call you again, they are in violation of the FDCPA. Never waive any rights for them. Ask them if they waive their right to payment?",
        "I would never advise a consumer to waive any rights, unless their is some excellent reason to do so, such as settlement of a lawsuit or claims, with an attorney reviewing the settlement agreement and giving legal advice to the client. In the context of a debt collector, if you waive your rights under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA), how far can they take this waiver (see below)? Does this mean that you are allowing them to harass you with calls at all hours of the night? That you are allowing them to make calls to your family and co-workers and neighbors and inform those persons that you have an unpaid debt?\n\nAre you so anxious to hear from these people that you want them calling you and not feeling constrained to comply with the requirements of the FDCPA? I would clearly not want to grant anyone from a debt collection agency a vague, oral waiver of rights to not be harassed under the FDCPA. The fact that they are asking for your permission to not comply with the FDCPA should be a red flag.\n\nIn the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals Case of Clark v. Capital Credit & Collection Services, 460 F.3d 1162, 1170-71 (9th Cir. 2006), the court held that a consumer can waive his or her rights under the FDCPA, but that such waiver should be narrowly tailored to match the intent of the consumer.\n\nAs with all debts, a medical account only becomes delinquent when the payment is not made as agreed with the medical provider. If the provider required payment at time of service, then payment later would be a delinquency. If the provider permits payments or agreed to accept payment directly from the insurance company, then payment is not required on day of service.\n\nRobert Stempler (please see DISCLAIMER below)\nwww.StopCollectionLawsuits.com\nwww.facebook.com/SoCalConsumerLawyer\nTwitter: @RStempler",

    "title": "Can you explain the collections process? We just received notice that our unpaid American Express bill is now in collections.",
    "question": "My husband's s-corp business is failing and he has a credit card that he hasn't been able to pay. We received a letter from Gatestone Collection Agency. The amount is over $25,000 and rising steadily with the monthly interest attached. Is there anything we can do to stop the hemorrhage? We're not sure how to deal with it. I fear that our bank account will be frozen and my paycheck must be direct-deposited. Could you please explain how the process works and if there's anything we should be doing to prepare ourselves for what lies ahead?",
    "answers": [
        "I would recommend you to consult with a Bankruptcy Attorney to see if you would qualify for Bankruptcy or Debt settlement. Sometimes creditors could place a levy in your account and even garnish your wages.",
        "With the financial issues that you are facing you should consider consulting with a lawyer about what your bankruptcy options may be.",
        "As I explain further in the FAQ area of my website and my article, \"Understanding Why You Were Sued,\" the collection process begins with several non-payments, typically three to six months of no payments on the credit card account. Financial institutions are required to consider the debts uncollectible, then charge them off as a bad debt, meaning that they can still collect them, but any amount collected after charge off is \"income\" not merely a paydown of the receivable due from the debtor. Many credit card debts are sold to a debt collector, but some credit card debt may be continued to be collected by the credit card company, it's debt collection lawyers, or an outside debt collection agency.\n\nAs for your bank account being frozen, if you have any open accounts at the bank, credit union, or financial institution where you have the unpaid credit card, they may be able to seize those funds to pay off the credit card, known as a \"banker's lien.\" It would be wise to withdraw the funds and close all such accounts immediately.\n\nIf you have accounts elsewhere, then you only need to worry about having those funds seized if your husband is served with a lawsuit for the debt, which he either ignored until a default judgment is entered or failed to resolve by settlement, bankruptcy discharge, or judgment of dismissal. After a judgment is entered, that judgment can be enforced against income and assets of the S-Corp and possibly him, including funds due from clients, customers, and others. A judgment that names your husband can also place a wage garnishment upon his wages and seize any bank account in his name. For that reason, it is time to have separate bank accounts for your paycheck and any other assets that you wish to protect, if he gets a judgment against him. You and he should consult with an experienced debt collection DEFENSE attorney.\n\nBy: Robert Stempler (please see DISCLAIMER below)\nCONSUMER LAW OFFICE OF ROBERT STEMPLER\nA Professional Law Corporation"

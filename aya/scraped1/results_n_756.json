    "title": "Personal Injury case is going to trial unless we can agree at mediation , mean while i still need medical attention ?",
    "question": "The doctors i saw before the filing of the law suit suggested that i would need to see a neuro psychologist and follow up on the possibility of surgery , but i was told that once we sent out the letter of demand the option to seek further medical was no longer open to me i assumed that we would be settling and decided i would seek further medical assistance on my own after settlement in order to not accrue any more medical debt out of pocket , but now we are looking at trial if we cant come to a agreement at mediation so where does that leave me medically ? My need for a neuropsychologist is urgent for me as well as finding relive from the physical pain i continue to suffer from will my attorneys be able to cover me thru liens or should they ? and will the findings be added to my case ?",

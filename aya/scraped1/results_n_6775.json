        "Unfortunately you cannot take the benefits of both CCP 703 and CCP 704.

        "Hi. When someone files bankruptcy one of the schedules that must be completed is Schedule C, which is your exemption schedule where you exempt out the property or assets that you want and can keep. In your situation, I would highly suggest you sit down and talk to an experienced bankruptcy attorney, because depending on what other assets you have, the wildcard exemption potentially is not your best option. There is a separate exemption section (C.C.P. 704) which allows you to protect a larger amount of equity in your home than the wildcard exemption you are entitled to under C.C.P 703. To be certain of the amount of equity in your property you may want to get an unbiased appraisal (i.e. one where you don’t seek a particular value). If there truly is more equity in your home than can be protected by the “wildcard ” exemption, again I would suggest talking to a qualified bankruptcy attorney who can give you options and advice based on your specific circumstances. Given what is at stake, personally I would not recommend filing bankruptcy on your own (without hiring an attorney).",

    "title": "Help. What do I do?",
    "question": "I was at fault to a accident in 2016. I just got notice about the large amount of money the other party is trying to recover. This exhaust my insurance money to be paid out. He is seeking around $30,000 more dollars from medical Bill's, ambulance bill, ect. The accident was minor. He was on a motorcycle and I tapped him while we were both at a red light. He went up in the air a little, and landed on his right arm/shoulder. I read all the paperwork and it says that he was involved in 2 other motorcycle accidents prior to this one. If I had bumped a car there would have been minor damage, if any damage at all. The other party and his private doctor say that he has trouble gripping things with his right hand, due to his injured elbow, back and neck, and that he has suffered emotional/physical pain. I feel he is just looking for a hand out, because he did not fall that hard at all. He is a 53 year old Male. I believe he is going to sue me with the next step. What should I do??",

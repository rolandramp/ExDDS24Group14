    "title": "What do I do after a collection company (junk debt buyer) does not respond to my validation of debt letter?",
    "question": "I have 2 collections on my credit report which are past the statute of limitations in my state. I have sent each one a validation of debt letter in which neither one have responded. I have also disputed the accounts with all three major credit bureaus; they are no help either because they do their own investigation and simply say the accounts belong to me. Any help will be appreciated. Thank you.",
    "answers": [
        "get ready for them to sue you and immediately retain a debt lawyer to help you answer the complaint so that a default judgment is not entered against you.",
        "First off, are they yours? If your credit reports are accurate with respect to the accounts, then disputing them will be of little help. Also, the staute of limitation for legal collection and the time a negative account can appear on your credit report reflect two different time periods.\n\nFinally, did you send the request for verification in response to a letter from the collector or as a result of seeing the account on your credit report? Collectors do not have to respond to requests for verification unless it is in response to a collection letter containing the validation notice required by the FDCPA, and then only if you make that request within 30 days of that notice. They may respond to you after that point, but are not legally required to do so.",
        "Were the reports made by the original creditors or by the collection agencies? What is the \"date of default\" according to the credit reports? Have you sustained actual damage as a result of the inaccurate credit reports?\n\nIf the credit reporting agencies have failed to conduct a \"reasonable\" reinvestigation, or if the named creditors have re-reported inaccurate information, you might have grounds to file a lawsuit. You will need to consult with an attorney to determine whether you have a viable case and whether it is financially worthwhile to pursue litigation. In many cases, the collection agency or creditor may be liable for your attorney's fees and other litigation expenses."

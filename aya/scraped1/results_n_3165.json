        "If you lived in CA for six months this is what you can do if you want to file here.\nThough there are many reasons for divorce, divorces usually fall into two categories: no-fault and at-fault.

You and your attorney may proceed to finalizing your divorce by default.\n\nYou can divorce your spouse even if you can’t find him/her and even without their participation in the divorce proceeding, so long as a Judge is satisfied that your spouse had notice of the divorce proceeding.

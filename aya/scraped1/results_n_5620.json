    "title": "Dissolved Corporation sued along with a shareholder as an individual. Only Shareholder answered. Default against corporation.",
    "question": "Dissolved Corporation and Shareholder as individual were sued for business credit card debt. I answered pro se (fee waiver) as the shareholder/individual but did not have enough money to hire attorney as required by law to answer for corporation. Plaintiff got default judgment against Corporation. Ultimately shareholder beat Plaintiff and had case dismissed without prejudice against shareholder. Now Plaintiff is sending letters and scheduling debtors exam for Corporation claiming shareholder is personally liable for corporate judgment and will pursue wage garnishment. Since shareholder beats lawsuit as individual how can I be liable for Corporate Judgment on the same case? Corporation and individual have no assets and Corporation had no assets before dissolving. Thank you in advance.",

        "If you were sued individually and got the case thrown out then there shouldn't be any other avenues for the plaintiff to attempt to collect from you personally. The plaintiff had their shot and lost. There is a doctrine known as \"law of the case\". If the judge has determined that you don't have personal liability for the debt, then that constitutes a binding ruling throughout the case. There is also the doctrine of res judicata that applies to bar relitigation of the same issue that already has been decided. If the corporation is insolvent then just answer the post-judgment discovery - which may require that you appear and give testimony in a post-judgment enforcement action against the corporation.",

The threats of a wage garnishment are just that, threats, and are intended to intimidate you into immediate action to pay the debt, well before the creditor has gotten a determination from the court for alter ego liability and judgment against the individual on that basis.

        "The issue is whether the corporation performed the appropriate steps to wind-up and dissolve according to the California requirements for dissolution.

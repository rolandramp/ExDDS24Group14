    "title": "Effect of discrepancies in discovery responses.",
    "question": "In my divorce case I propounded formal discovery on my husband. He has been uncooperative and has produced inadequate responses and documents. In his original responses he stated that he made a “diligent search” but couldn’t comply with many requests, but did not state who else might have the documents. He amended his responses to add that he was “unaware” of who might have them but did not state he made any “reasonable inquiry.” It makes no sense because he listed the properties related to the documents in his schedule of assets and debts as his separate property. Now he says he can’t find the related documents and implies he “knows nothing” of the facts to which I have no other access. Now he changed his responses to say the documents have been misplaced or lost. He’s all over the place and contradicts his previous responses and the facts. Because he signed his responses under oath, can I use any discrepancies he makes against his credibility at trial? How can I use this to my advantage at trial? And in the absence of any documents proving the properties are his separate property, how would these be adjudicated?",

        "I'd put to him his obligations on responding to your discovery requests and maybe you'll get better responses or support a viable motion to compel further responses. But, a proper review of your case is necessary to determine the value of so doing.\n\nYes, you can use inconsistent, evasive, and false responses to impeach his credibility in any relevant evidentiary hearing. But, your energy might be better spent establishing community property rights rather than attacking his unsupported claims of separate property rights in the same assets.",
        "You need skilled legal assistance as you also have the power of subpoena to get documents and records etc from banks and other institutions. Any real property titles are public record documents so you can get these without his help.",
        "The one part of your (long) post that can be easily answered is the separate property issue. Your husband will have the burden of proof. No proof, no confirmation to him of separate property.",
        "There are a number of remedies you have to force compliance, depending on how long ago you got the responses. If you have substantial properties and separate property/community property issues, in addition to the discovery issues, you shouldn't be doing this and planning on going to trial without an attorney to represent you.",
        "You can use verified discovery responses to impeach a witness who changes their response at trial. You may also wish to file a Motion to compel further responses if the responses are not complete, evasive, or just objections. Without knowing more about the discovery and responses it is difficult to say if your motion would be successful. Good luck!"

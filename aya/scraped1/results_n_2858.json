        "You need to consult with an attorney about this. If a special needs trust is prepared correctly and assets are transferred to it correctly, then it cannot typically be garnished for credit card debts of the trust beneficiary. However, these types of trusts are very complicated and should not be done by a lay person. Its unclear from the question whether, for example, the funds going into the special needs trust are those of the beneficiary, or some third party setting up a trust on their behalf. That information will be imperative to how such a trust would need to be set up and whether or not it would be successful. Please use the Find a Lawyer tool to find a lawyer in your area.",
        "I am wondering if you are asking too about whether or not a \"medical Bankruptcy\" is appropriate. Only a bankruptcy attorney can tell you, as that field is Very Federal. Make a list of the debts, amounts and purpose of each so that you can receive advice in confidence, but completely.\nIf the debts are gone, there may be no need for a Special Needs Trust.\nAnd the bankruptcy might be a less expensive legal way to proceed.",
        "It sounds like you wish to create a special needs trust, and there are preexisting debts to address. Those debts cannot be avoided by transferring the debtors property into a special needs trust now."

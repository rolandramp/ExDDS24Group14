    "title": "What is best way to remove judgment from credit report and settle with Capital One? Appeal ? Motion to vacate judgment ?",
    "question": "$5,000 of Credit Card Debit with Capital One Bank. Lost in San Diego superior court trial where me and my attorney were present. Capital One was awarded a Judgment for $4200 and attorney fees. Their last offer before court trial was 69% or $3,450. My last offer was 36% at $1800",
    "answers": [
        "Take their offer, pay it ( you lost) and ask them to vacate the judgment, which they should do for you. That way you can get the judgment removed from your credit report, if it shows up. As far as your credit report goes for a Cap One tradeline, ask them to zero it out. But you may be stuck. Can't have it all your way all the time.",
        "Call 'em up and offer a lump sum payment, say 50%, to satisfy the judgment. Judgment creditors generally want to get paid, rather than waste time/money on collection efforts.",
        "Neither an appeal or motion to vacate will get the judgment off your record or assist you in settling, unless you win the motion or the appeal. You don't suggest however that you have any actual grounds upon which the motion or appeal might be successful (neither of those procedures are the equivalent of a new trial). If you goal is to restore your credit and get Cap One off your back, you are likely going to have to pay it off. Cap One now had little to no incentive to compromise (the judgment is good for ten years and earns 10% interest each year!)",
        "You have a legitimate judgement, you won't get it off the credit report until it is resolved. Then it should show paid for seven years IRS so. Appeals will have to show where there were errors in the trial.\n\nThe lowest cost solution is pay the debt...",
        "I'm sorry to hear that you lost at trial. I'm curious… Did Capitol One have a witness present to testify at trial?\n\nCapitol One is one of the more difficult original creditors to work with. It seems that their settlement offers always come in around the 60-70% range once litigation starts. Much of how you approach a potential settlement post-judgment depends on your creditor's ability to collect on a judgment through a bank levy, wage garnishment, etc. If you cannot settle, you can expect them to continue collection efforts until the judgment is satisfied in full.\n\nGood luck to you!"

        "How were you harmed by the means test calculations being wrong? If they were right when you filed, you would still have the same legal obligation to pay your unsecured creditors $X per month. BTW, a good chapter 13 lawyer can often persuade the Trustee to accept less for the unsecured creditors than the result of the means test. But the lawyer has to be motivated to do this extra work. Hope this perspective helps.",
        "Simple answer first: It is very unlikely that you could have successfully sue a Trustee for taking actions in a bankruptcy case. They are protected by quasi judicial immunity for actions taken in the administration of a case.\nI sounds like the Trustee just discovered the errors in the means test, and is therefore bringing it up. You need to sit down with your present attorney and discuss your options. Without knowing the underlying facts it is impossible to say if either your first or second attorney would have any liability for the errors. They may have erred. They may have tried to simplify the process in explaining it to you and gone overboard. They may have doen nothing wrong (other than disappearing the the case of attorney #1.)\nThis forum is public and therefore not a place to discuss the underlying issues, but the first thing you need to do is determine your options, which requires that sit down with your attorney.",
        "Without knowing a lot more about your case, there is no way we can give you advice worth more than the amount you are paying for it. It is unusual for a trustee to come back 2+ years after filing and probably 2+ years after confirmation and advise that the original means test was calculated incorrectly. If you have faith in your current attorney talk to him or her about it, if not, consult with other local counsel who will be familiar with your trustee and judge and see what they say.",
        "It is unlikely you could sue the trustee, who works for the Court, not you, but if your bankruptcy attorney committed malpractice, there may be a claim. The only way to find out would be to consult with another attorney who handles such claims. By the way, I could not determine from your question how you were damaged by your attorney's actions."

    "title": "Is there a legal way to protect a future inheritance from student loan debt?",
    "question": "I am in my late 50s and have substantial student loan debt and no assets. I am not in default, however, it is unlikely that I'll be able to pay off this debt in my lifetime. (The original loan amounts have tripled due to continuing interest and fees.) My mother would like her children to inherit an equal share of her small estate (properties) but is concerned that anything left to me would immediately or eventually be taken to pay my student loans. Is there a legal way to prepare her estate to prevent this from happening? Or should I request that she place my share in some kind of trust with one of my siblings? Thank you!",
    "answers": [
        "Simply put, yes, you can legally shield the assets from future creditors. That's what estate planning does for many people. Your mom can set up a trust for you and the others such that only the trustee doles out funds and you never legally take possession of the assets, but can use them.",
        "I will assume that the student loans you are referring to are Federal Student Loans. If this is the case, the collection process of Federal Student Loans do not become aggressive, unless in Default. You have stated that your are current. If the student loans are private, the same rule applies. Your student loans are being manages, therefore, your inheritance is not at risk from collections and your mother does not have anything to be concerned with. If you fall into default, then other collection activities can occur. On the Federal end of things, the Dept. of Ed. can collect via benefit offset, to include tax refund intercept. On the private end of things, lawsuit only. You should seek the advice of a Student Loan Lawyer in California, not only to avoid any problems with your inheritance, but also some advice on how to manage your student loan debt.",
        "Student loan servicers generally don't seize assets or property, so you may be overestimating the risk. As to your question, yes, there are mechanism to accomplish what you want, you and your mother need to sit down with an estate planning attorney. A trust is the most likely vehicle for what you need to accomplish. However, the better approach would be to get on a path so that your student loans are not in default status.",
        "First, bankruptcy is not a good option unless you are in a very limited set of circumstances where the bankruptcy court could determine that it is an \"undue hardship\" unless the debt is discharged. The fact that you are able to make some minimum payment usually indicates that you will not be able to show undue hardship and the debt will not be discharged in bankruptcy. The standard to show undue hardship, primarily under the \"Brunner\" case, is extremely difficult to meet.\n\nOutside of bankruptcy, the creditor can collect from any asset you might have, but only if you are in default. I have seen that most student loan creditors are very forgiving and willing to make almost any extension arrangement you might need. Since there is currently no limitation on how long they have to collect and the debt is almost never dischargeable in bankruptcy, they will accept almost any amount of payment, as long as you keep paying each month, and not take any other collection action.\n\nFederally collected accounts (though a Federal agency) will take any tax refund you might be entitled to, but it is routine for them to not do much else to collect.\n\nThe idea of inheriting the property in a trust is a good one, but the trust must be established by your mother and it must provide that the only benefit you can ever get, through your entire lifetime, must be limited to something like \"possession\". That means you can never sell the property and can't pass it to your heirs. A \"spendthrift trust\" is what they are called. That trust would provide that you have some non-transferrable and non-income related benefit as long as you live, then the property would go to someone else (even your heirs).; You would never own the property, but just have some benefit from it. It that benefit is income, a creditor can collect from that if they have a judgment or are allowed to collect from you otherwise.\n\nKeep in mind that if you inherit the property and then try to put in your own trust, that may not work because that transfer by you to the trust will be reversible for a number of years (depending on the state).. In CA the statute is generally 3 years.\n\nYou and your mother should discuss this with an estate planning attorney. Unless you have other debt issues, you don't need a bankruptcy attorney.",
        "I'm not an estate planning attorney, but I believe one would be able to help you in what you're looking for.\n\nAs a side note: you did not specify if you were using an income driven repayment plan, but given that you have substantial student loan debt, no assets, but have still managed to stay current, I'm guessing there's a fair chance you are on an IBR/ICR plan. If you are, you should also consider how a large gain in a given year could affect your (i) eligibility for IBR/ICR, and (ii) what your monthly payments will go up to following the gain. I don't think it's likely that there will be a major problem, but all the more reason why you should consult with an estate planning attorney, and probably your student loan repayment servicer as well.",
        "More information is needed to give you useful advice. How much is your expected inheritance? What is your estimated receipt date? Is the property presently in a trust? If so, does it have a spendthrift provision?"

    "question": "So I am looking at clearing some debt that I have all on my own. But I don’t want it to affect my wife’s credit in any way. Is that possible for me to do. My wife owned her home and I’m not listed on her deed or Loan papers at all.",

        "There are parts to this puzzle that aren't in your question. As mentioned by others, there are income and community property questions to consider, not just credit scores.\n\nI strongly recommend that you have a consultation (usually free) with an experienced bankruptcy attorney.

        "If you have separate debts and she does not file with you, your filing is not going to effect her credit.

I have never seen one that was a problem. In fact, you are more likely to be allowed after you file bankruptcy as you are no longer a security risk. With the debts you describe, you have more of a chance to get the job when you have discharged your debts than if you have not done so.\n\nWhile you are protected from discrimination as to government benefits or even keeping a job, there is an issue when it comes to getting hired. You can be discriminated against for private business when it comes to hiring practices.

        "In a chapter 7 bankruptcy all of the community property belongs in the bankruptcy estate.

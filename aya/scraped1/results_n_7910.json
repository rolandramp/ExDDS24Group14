        "It means the plaintiff must demonstrate to the court that the plaintiff has made diligent efforts to serve you with the summons and complaint. Normally, this is done by the plaintiff filing a Proof of Service of Summons. If a Proof of Service of Summons is not on file by the date of the Order to Show Cause hearing, the court can dismiss the case, or the court can postpone the Order to Show Cause hearing to permit the plaintiff additional time to locate and serve you.\n\nUnless and until you have been served, there is nothing you need to do.\n\nA Case Management Conference is used to apprise the court of the case status, and to set a trial date if all parties are present before the court. Again, no need to do anything if you have not yet been served.",
        "It means that your creditor is still pursuing this case and will very soon be serving you with the complaint before the OSC scheduled for 7/29.\n\nThe Case Management Conference is a scheduling conference that usually takes place about 5 months after a case is filed to give the plaintiff a chance to serve everyone and to give every defendant a chance to respond. The judge asks the parties the status of everything and often send the parties to a settlement judge. The CMC won't happen on 7/29 because you haven't even been served yet.\n\nYou can go online now and download a copy of the complaint to get a jump on responding, if you plan to respond.\n\nWhat I usually advise people is if they don't have a good defense to the lawsuit, like expiration of the statute of limitations, or if their combined debts aren't so overwhelming that bankruptcy makes sense, then they're probably best off letting the creditor get a judgement quickly. Fighting a losing lawsuit usually means you'd be liable for the creditor's legal fees, plus a higher pre-judgment interest rate than the 10% post-judgment rate."

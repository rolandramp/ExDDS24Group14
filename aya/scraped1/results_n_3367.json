    "title": "California Set-off with contribution rule. In a Joint and Several Judgment : bank vs 3 defendants (all guarantors)",
    "question": "In a previous court case, the bank received a judgment (joint and several) against 3 defendants. Since the ruling of the judgment, 2 of the defendants negotiated settlements with the bank which have been kept confidential, but believed to be about 1/10th of the amount of the judgment and releasing them from liability (they both have the financial ability to pay their 1/3 share of the judgment) The bank has now placed a levy on the property of the third defendant and a writ to sell it to satisfy the remaining judgment. (One of the settling defendants is making installments on his settlement which will be paid off by the levy also) Since the bank released the two parties based on the settlement amounts they agreed to, shouldn't the judgment be reduced by their pro rata share ?",

        "I believe you can go back to the Superior Court that rendered judgment and move to stay the levy, ask for a setoff and accounting.\n\nAlso a setttlement between co-debtors and the creditor should've been disclosed and a fairness hearing heard, so that you don't end up paying more than your 1/3rd.\n\nSounds to me if the debtor has paid up to 1/3rd then the levy should be severed and satisfied.\n\nNot enough facts, but this is one for contribution, indemnity and setoff. CCP 187 provides that a judgment may be modified to conform to the spirit of the Code.\n\n\"There can be only one satisfaction for any injury; hence satisfaction of the judgment by . . . payment by one or more of the joint or current tortfeasors, extinguishes the obligation and discharges the liability of all the others[.]’ ” (McCall v. Four Star Music Co. (1996) 51 Cal.App.4th 1394, 1398, italics omitted.) A defendant’s payment of amounts the judgment awards to the plaintiff discharges all other defendants who may be liable for the same injury. (Id. at p. 1399; Fletcher v. California Portland Cement Co. (1979) 99 Cal.App.3d 97, 99.)\n\nUnder 187, the judgment may be amended, reopened or satisfied, stricken or any thing else necessary to accomplish and do justice.\n\nIf the others settled for less with the plaintiff, and plaintiff accepted it, then the judgment should be discharged.\n\nA setoff “ ‘[is] founded on the equitable principle that “either party to a transaction involving mutual debts and credits can strike a balance, holding himself owing or entitled to the net difference[.]” [Citation.]’ ” (Keith G. v. Suzanne H. (1998) 62 Cal.App.4th 853, 859.) Setoff is allowed in actions to enforce a money judgment. Offset, however, is a right of the judgment debtor, who may elect to exercise or to refrain from exercising it. (Margott v. Gem Properties, Inc. (1973) 34 Cal.App.3d 849, 855.) The right may be exercised: (1) by an equitable action by the debtor against the judgment creditor to have the claim offset against the judgment (Harrison v. Adams (1942) 20 Cal.2d 646, 651); (2) a cross-complaint by the debtor in an action brought by a judgment creditor against the debtor (Miller v. Murphy (1921) 186 Cal. 344, 347); or (3) a motion by defendant in that action after judgment has been given for the creditor (Layne v. Superior Court (1932) 121 Cal.App. 206, 207).\n\nIt is the third circumstance, a motion under 187 that allows you to offset or discharge the judgment."

    "title": "Will my ssdi be included as income if I file for a chapter 13 of chapter 7?",
    "question": "I'm retired and also collecting ssdi.",
    "answers": [
        "Under current 9th Circuit law (applicable to CA), the SSDI---as opposed to pension, for example--would not be factored into determining the threshold for payment in chapter 13; and it would not affect eligibility for chapter 7. The SSDI funds may be allocated to a chapter 13 payment plan to promote its feasibility.",
        "More fundamental questions are whether there is a specific goal for you to attain by filing chapter 13 and what amount you have left over after paying only your necessary living expenses? For example, I represent a number of seniors who are having their social secuity benefits seized for eithér income tax or federal student loans they obtained for their kids. Chapter 7 would only stop the garnishment for a few months wheras chapter 13 could prevent this for up to 5 years by making a relatively modest payment to a bankruptcy trustee. Hope this perspective helps!",
        "I agree with the prior answers, but your confusion is because SSDI income is handled differently in chapter 7 BK cases as opposed to Chapter 13 cases. In both chapters you must list the income on schedule I, which is the statement of all income you receive from all sources. However, social security benefits are excluded from what is called \"current monthly income\" under 11 USC 101(10A).\n\nThe difference becomes significant for the means test portion of a chapter 7 or chapter 13. That’s a test where your income is compared against the median income for the region in which you live. If your income is below the median income, then the means test is not an issue for a chapter 7. However, if your income is above the median, then the second part of the test applies where a series of fixed necessary expenses are applied (gas, food, housing, medical, etc) and if your income then falls back below the median, you pass the means test. If not, then a presumption of abuse arises, and the Court may dismiss your case.\n\nIn a chapter 7, SSDI income does not apply as “income” for the purposes of the means test. However, it does apply as income in a 13 because you are proposing a monthly payment plan to the creditors and need to show that you have sufficient income to meet your living expenses while still making the monthly payments.\n\nAnd I strongly recommend as the other answers did that you talk to another attorney, and do not try to file it yourself. Bankruptcy is too complex and has too many rules and pitfalls for you to be able to handle it yourself.",
        "Not for the \"means test\" but it is on Schedule I in order to determine your disposable income.",
        "I wont repeat what is already said in those great answers as you have read it by now. But the reason you are confused is because you \"read\" it somewhere..DONT rely on anything you read. In fact, I tell my clients to FORGET what they read and listen to me. You only care really about 2 questions..can you keep all assets with equity and can you discharge all debts! But other issues can greatly affect your case too so I point out some of those just to make you understand the huge mistake if you don't meet with an experienced attorney...and some persons learn the hard way as the second your case is filed, that determines the results!\n\nYou need and want to enjoy your fresh start also. But the most important thing is to meet with an attorney as you asking this question means you have not. You care about 2 goals: keeping everything you have equity in and discharging all your debts. If you don't have any of the exceptions to discharge you will obtain that goal; most exceptions are set forth in 11 USC. 523 (Google it) like child support, some income taxes, traffic (in a ch 7) and criminal fines , and presumption of student loans. But some debts are dischargeable in a ch 13 but NOT in a ch 7 so you want to make sure and your attorney will discuss any such types with you also!\n\nYour exemptions depend on what state you have lived in in the last 2 years and thus if in your state, then your states exemptions will apply. Most persons filing keep everything they own but your attorney will confirm that with you when they learn everything you own and the equity thereof!\n\nSome secured debts like homes, vehicles, other secured debts an attorney will discuss your options on also as you must list any debts; but that does not mean you will lose them unless you have too much equity or are in default on paying for them! Discuss those options if they apply with your attorney too.\n\nBut other issues can arise that can greatly harm your case. Just one example: If you paid back a relative $3,000 11 months ago and now file bankruptcy next week, the trustee can SUE that relative to retrieve that $3,000 (under what is called a preference) for the benefit of the bankruptcy estate. As a result, most attorneys don't charge to meet with them the first meeting so meet with one no matter what.\n\nMany great attorneys can be found right here on AVVO in your state so look, call, and meet one as soon as you can.\n\nYou should also want to know when to file: is there an advantage of waiting versus filing now and who should you pay between now and then! Good luck and enjoy your later fresh start.",
        "I know that the law can be confusing. As to the \"means test\" your income is not counted though with your income it would not make a difference. As to listing the income from SSI on the Income ( I ) Schedule it is disclosed. In some cases the money is needed for a successful Chapter 13 reorganization plan to work.\n\nDo yourself a great favor. Don't try to be your own lawyer when dealing with Bankruptcy. You won't get it right. At least contact a quality bankruptcy lawyer here in Sacramento to go over your options with you. Once you have good information then you can make a good decision as to what is best for you.",
        "There are three forms which require information income. The \"means test\" which determines if you qualify for a chapter 7 or chapter 13 does not include social security in its calculations. The statement of income and expenses includes all ongoing income, including social security. The Statement of Financial affairs includes all income received for the year of filing (to date), and the prior two years.\nI strongly suggest you contact a local experienced bankruptcy attorney to discuss filing a chapter 13 with them. Most offer free intial consultations, so you can have your case assessed and make a decision from there.",
        "As stated by my colleagues, you must disclose your SS income on Schedule I. Income is also disclosed in connection with the \"Means Test\" . The \"Means Test\" was originally intended to steer certain high income individual to a Chapter 13. If you're already planning to file a Chapter 13, you have to show the trustee you have the ability to present a feasible Chapter 13 Plan. Virtually all non-lawyer assisted 13's are dismissed on procedural grounds. Don't be part of that statistic. Find/Consult/Hire an Avvo BK lawyer. This is not a DIY project. Too much is at stake.",
        "There are different locations for disclosing income in a bankruptcy. There is schedule I and the means test. SSDI is not considered for the means test, but still needs to be disclosed on schedule I. For a chapter 13 bankruptcy, you need to show an income sufficient to fund the plan or an ability to make the monthly payments. Hence, for example, if you were to not include any income in the bankruptcy documents, you wouldn't qualify for a chapter 13.\n\nI suggest you speak with another attorney to determine your options moving forward. It may be a good idea and hopefully the next attorney will explain everything more thoroughly.\n\nGood luck."

    "title": "Can a person claim the standard expense deduction for rent/mortgage if they live free of charge with their parents?",
    "question": "I loaned a friend 50,000 a few years ago. he refused to pay me back. I was able to obtain a judgment and wage garnishment was about to begin and then he filed chapter 7. He makes good money and does not have a mortgage or rent and other than my debt has little unsecured credit. he used the standard $2400 for rent/mortgage even though he does not pay it. how can I get my debt from being discharged? Ionly have a few weeks left before this happens?",
    "answers": [
        "If you want to find out if your debt is non-dischargeable you must timely file a Complaint to Determine Dischargeability before the \"bar date\". You will likely fail in this effort without the assistance of an experienced creditor's rights attorney. The \"overstated\" rent claim is not relevant to the dischargeability process. Click the Avvo tab \"Find a Lawyer\" before it is too late to take the appropriate action. Read 11 USC ยง523 which lists the possible avenues available in a non-dischargeability claim. The list of so-called \"bankruptcy crimes\" may shed light on whether or not you have a viable claim to prevent the discharge of your $50K debt. Good luck to you.",
        "What may not be clear is that there are two places in a Chapter 7 filing where expenses are important. One is the so-called Means Test, which I assume is what you referred to, where he does get to use the housing standard deduction. But there is also Schedule J, where he should have listed the actual (or expected) rent monthly expense. If Schedule I (monthly net income) is significantly greater than the total monthly expenses on Schedule J, that could be grounds for denying a discharge of debts n a Chapter 7; A Chapter 13 payment-plan bankruptcy would still be possible.",
        "As Dorothy states, that is the law.\n\nSchedule J shows actual expenses.\n\nThird, it is most likely you in fact will never see a dime as a loan is not a non dischargeable type debt in and of itself absent fraud, etc. Thus, better not to spend good money chasing bad. You can employ an attorney just to look at the facts and they can download schedules I and J, etc. to scrutinize, and then you will have an informed opinion based on those facts..and if desired, pay the attorney to question him at the 341 meeting! Good luck.",
        "The reason it is called a \"standard expense deduction\" is because everyone gets to claim it. Maybe worth bringing in a bankruptcy professional to review the petition for potential weakness you can attack. Hope this perspective helps!"

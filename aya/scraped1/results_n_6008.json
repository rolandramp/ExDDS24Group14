    "title": "Nasty Divorce, Wife's Mother wants Joinder, both of us oppose, can we keep her out if that's all we agree on?",
    "question": "My wife and I are going through a really bad divorce that has just spiraled out of control. Her parents have been divorced for years and her mother absolutely hates her father because her father had primary custody of her and her sisters. We had business dealings as we were all partners with her father. Now her mother is trying to join the case claiming she loaned us our share of an initial investment. She is doing this to destroy her ex-husband and put us in miserly to because we saw her father more often. Can we jointly oppose her moms joinder and if so will it be automatic?",
    "answers": [
        "Joinder is a difficult motion. It is NOT just automatically granted, and likewise a joint opposition would not automatically block someone from joining a matter. However, from the fact pattern, I do not see why it is appropriate for this to be addressed in the family law court. If she feels she is owed some money by you two, then thats a civil matter, and it has very little to do with the division of your assets and debts.\n\nHopefully you have counsel to address this, so that even if it is denied, it doesnt cost you time, money, and grief.",
        "The court can join parties to a case if they are NECESSARY to the fair and just disposition of the case. If your MIL had a money claim against the two of you, this is a debt collection action and not a part of property division (i.e. not part of the divorce).\n\nHer rights as an alleged creditor are no superior to those of other creditors. Are credit card companies now going to join in divorce actions? See how absurd her argument is?",
        "It sounds like your mother-in-law bears little relationship to your dissolution and marriage. Your statement does not say she is claiming ownership but rather she loaned you funds to acquire your investment. On that face, on that basis, it appears she doesn’t even have a lien on the ownership interest in the business but rather simply a claim for money as against the both of you. She should file her own separate, independent civil action if she wishes to pursue this claim. If properly presented by you or your attorney I don’t believe the Judge would be agreeable to join her in the dissolution action.",
        "Accord with Mr. Wiliams' response. However, even if both of your oppose her mother's Joinder motion, there is no guarantee that the Court won't grant the joinder, especially if you are in Pro Per and unfamiliar with legal matters. If you are not now represented by counsel, you would best retain an experienced Family Law Attorney to advise and represent you."

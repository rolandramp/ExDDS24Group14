    "title": "Chapter 13 Bankruptcy and ability of lender to placed forced property insurance and pay past property taxes due",
    "question": "I am a lender secured by a deed of trust in which the borrower has filed chapter 13 bankruptcy. The borrower does not have property insurance on the property secured by the deed of trust and is behind a year in property taxes. Can I placed force insurance on this property and pay borrower's back property taxes such the borrower ultimately becomes responsible to reimburse me these expense plus the note interest on the advances? ( I know this is the case before bankruptcy.)",
    "answers": [
        "You need to review your mortgage agreement carefully. I would suggest that you be careful with the type of force placed insurance you get depending on the jurisdiction in light of the recent challenges to those force placed insurances. With respect to the property taxes, that would depend on whether the mortgage agreemetn allows you to create an escrow account. Keep in mind that tax collector's office is a secued creditor of the bankruptcy eststae with its own rights in bankruptcy. You may be able to lift automatic stay based on these grounds too, but you will probably need to consult a bankruptcy attorney for that purpose.",
        "You need to look at the written agreement you entered into. Does it say you can force place insurance? Does it say you will get reimbursed for taxes you pay? When you enter into a contract, the contract is what rules. There are no laws that fill in the blanks. There might be past court cases that may fill in some of the blanks, but there is no guarantee. That is why having an attorney when you entered into the arrangement would have made this question unnecessary.",
        "Yes, as a secured lender you can take those steps and file the expenses with your POC. You can also make a Motion to Vacate Stay for failure to pay post petition insurance and taxes. Get a bankruptcy creditor counsel to assist you, and if yo are over secured, the debtor has to pay counsel fees."

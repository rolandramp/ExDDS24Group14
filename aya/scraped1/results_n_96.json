        "If you don't want to keep the same attorney to handle the conversion of your current ch13 to ch7, you don't have to. You can allow your current ch13 to be dismissed and you can file a new ch7 if that works out to be less expensive. You should include the debt owed to your ch13 attorney in your petition and schedules.",
        "On the date of a conversion to a ch 7, all debts owed up to that point must be included in the new case including any outstanding attorney fees. It takes time and money to represent you in ch 7 just like if you go to a new attorney to do so which you can easily. Thus, call around, check their fees, and compare to what your attorney wants and make that informed decision. However, your new attorney, if such, will be charging for a conversion and representing you in a ch 7 and thus that is what the comparison will be for. if any past due debt still owed your attorney, or any new debts since ch 13 was filed owed to anyone, must be included by law (and cheaper to add before conversion so that they receive 341 notice and your new attorney does not have to serve and file proof) . Good luck.",

    "title": "Is it possible to get bankruptcy that was filed but voluntarily dismissed removed from record if I pay all debts in full?",
    "question": "We filed bankruptcy to stop a foreclosure on our house. First we filed Chapter 13 then had to convert to chapter 7. After we filed a modification came through for the house so we didn't need the bankruptcy after all and let it dismiss. We have a family member who has offered to pay off all our debt in full if it will get the bankruptcy off our record. Is there anything a lawyer can do to make this possible?",

        "All the attorneys who have answered you regarding removal of your bankruptcy from your credit report are correct. In fact, the bankruptcy will remain on your record for 10 years at which time it will drop off. On the other hand, if you have monitored your credit reports, you will probably see that your credit score is improving every year. Bankruptcy does not really affect you for the entire 10 years, or even for two or three years from the date of filing. Take a look at your credit report. You might be surprised at your score.",
        "No, unfortunately the minute you file bankruptcy it is on your credit report; you cannot undo it no matter how your debts end up being settled.",
        "The purpose of your credit report is to accurately reflect your credit history. That includes a Bankruptcy filing, and that is relevant information future creditors will/may find important. Relatives may not be willing to ante up for future debts. There is no magic for erasing accurate information from a credit report. You can try disputing it, but you'd have to be really, really lucky to have it removed and even then it'll come back. This is simply the consequences of the decision to file.",
        "No. You filed bankruptcy. You cannot change reality.",
        "Once it is filed, it is on the Credit Record. They only have to remove inaccurate information, not information that you just do not want there."

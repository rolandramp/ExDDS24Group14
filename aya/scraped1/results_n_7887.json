        "There is a small loophole in Chapter 13s for property equalization debts to a former spouse but I do not think any debt classified as \"support\" is going to fall into that category.\n\nWhile even property equalization debts cannot be discharged in Chapter 7 pursuant to 11 U.S.C. 523(a)(15), crafty divorce attorneys have been getting around this by characterizing payments that might otherwise be support as equalization for other property. Because California is a community property state, equalization debts can legitimately arise in a divorce decree but I think they are now put there strategically by lawyers who want to be able to discharge their clients promises via a Chapter 13 at a later date.\n\nNevertheless, I don't think based on your facts that this loophole applies in your situation.\n\nBest regards,\nHamid",
        "There is a loophole that can allow discharge of a child support debt owed to a governmental unit, but I believe it is only available through a Chapter 13. This is something that only comes up every once in a while & I would have to research it to be sure.\n\nAnyone else remember how this works?",

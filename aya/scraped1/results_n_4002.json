    "title": "Can 1 partner of an LLC freeze a business account? how is payroll made if the account is frozen???????",
    "question": "my husband has 1 partner in his llc business and they are in disagreement as to what to do with the company and his partner froze the business account and we are now unable to make payroll. The company is loosing money partly because of the economy and the of marketing effort on his partner but his partner seems to disagree on fault. Anyways, the office lease is killing them and causing a loss each month. My husband just found another business to sublease our space so we could get out of our lease obligation and shut the business down without having to payout the lease. His partner feels that he should get his full amount of funds back with no loss so he froze the account. What are your thoughts on what to do now, we will be looking for an attorney but what could we do in the meantime??",

You need to negotiate a mutually workable break up asap, but employees need to get paid, or they will take you all to labor court. You need to lay off employees asap to cut off further potential liability, and since you are closing down the business anyway.\nToo much to go over in this forum, contact a local experienced business attorney.",

    "title": "What possibly can be done?",
    "question": "my mother passed 2002, she had a will, (my brother held on to it for 14 years, i never knew about my mother's will until my stepfather passed 2016), the girlfriend of my stepfather changed all information on all accounts including my mother's company. On the bank statements, it says my stepfather was owner with my mother's name nowhere on it. The will looked like it had been tampered with, it's not my mother's writing. On my stepfather's death certificate, it states he is a pipe fitter, on my mother's death certificate, it states she is self employed, owner of identification. They had put joint owner on all accounts and co- owner on a primary linked account on an that legal order processing said belongs to us but that is not what the bank told my sister and i. The bank told us there is a primary linked account in your mother's name that belongs to her children. Not soon after that, the administrators bank manager wrote the court saying that account had a co- owner and that it was a joint account. How can I get my mother's bank statements from the time she first opened them.?",

You need to hire your own probate lawyer to look into your mother's death as well as your stepfather's."

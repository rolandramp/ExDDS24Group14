    "title": "Should we assign the ownership of a trademark currently owned by our LLC to a managing member while LLC dissolves & reorganizes?",
    "question": "Currently, I am the managing member of a CA LLC. Due to many issues, we have decided to dissolve the LLC and reorganize in the near future with a different structure. In order to preserve the life of the trademark, is it possible to assign the ownership to me personally while the LLC is being dissolved. Then once we create a new company, we plan on reassigning the trademark to it. This particular IP will be necessary.",

        "This question sounds harmless enough on the surface but invites numerous answers to questions that are raised by facts you have not given. Be VERY careful in this situation or your could end up with litigation involving an accounting, appraisal rights, or even involuntary dissolution IF all of the members do not agree with your assignment. If the trademark is the only asset of any value BUT you have creditors, you may be making a fraudulent conveyance to move the trademark outside the reach of the KNOWN creditors. Another big potential problem is harming the mark in the process of creating a holding company and licensing it outside of transferring its goodwill. If you make a naked license without the goodwill, you could have big problems. Lastly, you should ALSO consult with your CPA before you do anything since many of these choices have significant tax implications as suggested by others that have previously responded. Seek an experienced business and intellectual property lawyer right away. Good luck!",
        "From your question it appears the trademark is registered in the name of the LLC. As indicated in prior answers, how it is to be set up depends on various factors such as when and by whom you expect the trademark to be reused, the value of the trade mark, any tax implications from the manner it is to be distributed, the relationships between the parties, .the actual method title to the trademark is to be held, i.e. outright or in trust, the need to register the trademark, etc. etc. The very fact and manner in which you have asked this question indicates your need for professional guidance particularly if the trade mark has any significant value. To hopefully avoid future conflict and grief talk to and retain a knowledgeable attorney.",
        "Dear Van Nuys, Your suggestion is certainly possible assuming all the LLC owners are in agreement, (and get that in writing from ALL owners). The other low cost possibility is that it be transferred to all the owners, assuming there are only 2 or 3 and assuming they all will own the new LLC and all agree to a subsequent transfer. If you are going to form a new LLC, just have the assignment done immediately upon formation of the new LLC...the dissolution of the original LLC can take its time.\n\nReally the question is WHY are you dissolving and is there conflict among the owners already such that if you go ahead with your plan, you may be inviting litigation. When an LLC dissolves, the assets are distributed to the owners, not the managing member, in percentage of ownership holdings, or as otherwise defined in the LLC operating agreement. Since this asset is clearly valuable, you do need to make sure the dissolution process is correct, and that the debts are paid, including the final tax return...(in CA even if 2014 is your last return, you still owe the $800 min even if there is no income--(if you havn't paid it already).\n\nMy point is if the dissolution is due to some conflict you'll need more advice than the simple question you ask. As my colleague states, a legal strategy consultation is probably in order to determine other points you have not stated that will come into play.",
        "There are dozens of possible solutions to this problem. Some have been previously suggested by other attorneys and are certainly worthy of considering.\n\nFor example, many of my clients have formed an intellectual property (\"IP\") holding company to manage and maintain their intellectual property assets. Then, the IP holding company will license the intellectual property to the operating company. By doing this, the intellectual property assets aren't owned by the operating company so the operating company can go out of business without impacting the intellectual property assets.\n\nWhile this solution is a good choice for some companies, it's not appropriate for every situation so don't make a decision based on this suggestion only. This is definitely a situation where the right decision is best made after consulting with an experienced professional so as to avoid any potential harm to the trademark.",
        "I agree with my colleague that an escrow or an attorney or even a trustee would be a better option. A consultation with an experienced attorney wouldn't be a bad idea here. Good luck.",
        "have you considered having an escrow company hold the asset, or you could probably have an attorney hold the trademark, until you reorganize or until continuing to hold will have tax consequences. I would see a competent Corporate attorney and your CPA regarding tax issues."

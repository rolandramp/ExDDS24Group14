        "This loan should be dischargeable in bankruptcy. When you say \"the SBA\" started garnishing your check in 2011 - I don't understand how that would happen if they charged off the loan - is it a collection agency? Did you file a Claim of Exemption when you received the garnishment? Or attempt to? I'm curious who is \"them\" that is garnishing your wages? If you don't have money to pay a lawyer to fiile bk you can do it yourself by going to the Self-Help desk at the Woodland Hills bankruptcy court or Public Counsel downtown. I volunteer at Public Counsel and we do intake downtown. If accepted and you likely will be - you will attend a seminar that walks you through the filing process step by step."

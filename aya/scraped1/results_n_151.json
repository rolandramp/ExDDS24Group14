    "title": "I was just served a creditor lawsuit, can I somehow file California bankruptcy in 2021?",
    "question": "I was just served a creditor lawsuit and my deadline to respond is December 13. Is there any way to extend the lawsuit into 2021 when the new, more favorable California homestead exemption law comes into effect? I qualify for the existing $175,000 exemption and my house is worth less than that, but would prefer the new exemptions.",

        "Be sure to consult with an experienced bankruptcy attorney sooner than later. The last thing you want is a default judgment and then a lien put on your home to enforce that judgment. Best time to start consulting with lawyers is now.\n\nBest of luck!",
        "You need to get an attorney to advise you how to best deal with this issue.\nWaiting and doing nothing, is not going to help you. So the other answers\noutline what course of action is best but get an attorney.",
        "I agree with the other answers, but just wanted to point out that there are limitations and exceptions to the new higher homestead exemptions, so be sure you consult with an experienced bankruptcy attorney about your situation to make sure you are able to get the higher exemption amount after January 1, 2021.",
        "You need to find an experienced,, local attorney to review your information and help you file. If needed, you can have your bankruptcy attorney contact the creditor's attorney and request an extension of time to respond.\nI would like to note, however, the creditor must still take several actions before they can collect on the debt, including entering your default and requesting a default judgement, which are likely to take until next year to complete. Only then can they lien your house. By then the homestead increase would have occurred, and you can file and protect the higher exemption values.",
        "You have several options: 1. File a General Denial, (one page form available on the court's website forms tab (unless you successfully bring a motion for a filing fee waiver, you will have to pay the court filing fee of between $255-$450 depending on the size of the debt); 2. Do nothing and risk having a default judgment taken against you with a possibility of an abstract of judgment being recorded against your real estate; 3. Calling opposing counsel to request an extension of time (probably zero chance of them granting it unless you tell them you are filing BK and giving them the name of your BK lawyer); 4. Contacting an Avvo lawyer to make the request for additional time to respond due to a pending bankruptcy (probably 95% chance of success).\n\nFind/consult/hire a lawyer in your area using the Avvo feature \"Find a Lawyer\".

        "Of course. Just file a written response in Superior Court on time, whether answer (or demurrer or motion to strike), and file your bankruptcy petition on or after January 1, 2021.",

    "title": "How do I stop a levy on my bank account?",
    "question": "I just discovered that GE Capital Bank has a judgment against me and a levy on my bank account. They took all the money from my checking account and are threatening to continue to take the remaining funds as they become available unless I make a payment arrangement with them. Is there a way to get my money back and stop the levy? This debt was from 2004 and I understand the statute of limitations has run out.",
    "answers": [
        "You need to talk to an attorney. Depending on your situtation you may have several options.",
        "If they took the money from you, they have a judgment against you which means that the statute of limitations is no longer relevant. If you file bankruptcy within ninetey days of the levy and the amount taken from your account would have been exempt had you filed bankruptcy, then your bankruptcy attorney can probably get the money back by filing the appropriate motion. Not all bankruptcy attorneys know how to do this, so make sure yo hire an experienced attorney and discuss this with him.",
        "If they have a valid judgment against you, there is not a statute of limitations issue on their collections. If you were not served with the lawsuit that led to the judgment, you could perhaps attack the judgment on the basis that you did not have notice of the lawsuit. You could also potentially file a bankruptcy, which would stop any further collection efforts and give you at least the potential of recovering amounts garnished in the 90 days prior to filing. However, there are many issues in bankruptcy. Your best option is to set a consultation or two with a bankruptcy attorney as soon as possible to discuss whether bankruptcy is right for you in the context of your entire financial situation. Many do free consultations.",
        "I don't think the st. of lim applies. Once you file for bankruptcy you can do a Motion to avoid lien to remove the judgement but until you file they can do what they want with your account.",
        "You need to discuss the Statute of Limitations with an attorney; the rules can be complicated, and it's likely the case was filed prior to the SOL expiring. Meanwhile, you have other options. If the service of process to you was defective, you may be able to set the case aside. Alternatively, bankruptcy might be a viable option, if you qualify and if the debt is large enough. These are all matters to discuss at a free consultation with a debt attorney. Good luck, and remember to designate a best answer!",
        "The statute of limitations was a defense to raise in the lawsuit, not after."

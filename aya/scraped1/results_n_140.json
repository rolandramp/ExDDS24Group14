        "Yes, the new homestead exemption goes into effect January 1, 2021 and as the others have stated, the amount will be between $300,000 and $600,000 depending on the median income in the county where the case is filed and property is located.\n\nThis only applies, however, to properties purchased more than 1215 days (approximately 3.3 years) prior to the filing of the bankruptcy case and it is important that the funds paid for the home not have come from an otherwise avoidable transfer. For example, you can't just take $200,000 sitting in your bank account now and pay down your mortgage just to protect the $200,000 with the new higher exemption.\n\nAs always, it is important to consult with a qualified bankruptcy attorney about your specific facts and circumstances.",

        "On September 15, 2020, California Governor Gavin Newsom signed into law Assembly Bill 1885 (AB1885) which increases the creditor homestead exemption for personal residences in California. The new homestead starts at $300,000 and up to $600,000 based on the median sale price of homes within a particular county in a particular year. The new homestead amounts will also be indexed against inflation in the future, so the amounts automatically increase without further legislation. Wait until after the new year to file the bankruptcy and you must consult with a qualified bankruptcy attorney in your area.",
        "The amount of the new homestead exemption that becomes effective January 1, 2021 is the greater of $300,000 or the countywide median sale price of a single-family home in the calendar year prior to the calendar year in which the judgment debtor claims the exemption, not to exceed $600,000. There is a single amount countywide, no longer tied to marital status, number of dependents, age, disability or income.\n\nAccording to the Los Angeles Times in an article published October 21, 2020, in Los Angeles County, the median sales price rose 14.5% from a year earlier to $710,000. That would result in Los Angeles County residents being entitled to the maximum exemption of $600,000.",
        "It's true. AS of January 1, the homestead exemption in California will vary from a minimum of $300,00 to a maximum of $600,000. The exact number will depend on the median value of a home for the previous year in the county in which you reside. In Los Angeles County you will probably be close to the $600,000 number, but please consult with a bankruptcy lawyer in the county in which you reside."

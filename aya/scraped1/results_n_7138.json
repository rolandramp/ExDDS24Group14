    "title": "Forgot to declare equipment in CH7 - what can they do?",
    "question": "I filed CH 7 3 weeks ago and I have two laptops I ordered on a Best Buy credit card - one was 2 months ago and a second a few weeks before I filed CH7. I spaced and forgot to list them in my BK filing (my lawyer is out of town and I am trying to find an answer today). The filing was made last week.",

        "First off, try not to stress out about filing the amendment TODAY. An amendment can be filed at any time before the case is discharged, even after the 341 meeting. Just be sure to mention these circumstances to your attorney before you go into the meeting and typically Trustee asks if there are any changes to make to the petition and that is your opportunity to disclose and explain that you forgot to list this item. It is not unusual, although all efforts are made to prevent this, for a debtor to forget something on their petition.\n\nYour attorney will want to amend Statement of Financial Affairs and discuss the theft of the items. In my experience, Best Buy doesn't come to the 341 but they do send letter and/or call your attorney to discuss reaffirming the debt, settling amounts owed, or turning over the property in question. Reason for this is that unlike other credit cards, store credit cards, as other counsel pointed out, typically have a security interest in the purchased items. Also, the purchase so close to the filing is another issue. Discuss this with your attorney, there is time to get this straightened out. The best route is to disclose even if the facts are bad and deal with them, not hide them. If you are honest and disclose, the worst thing that can happen is that you might have to pay for the laptops. If you are dishonest and don't disclose the information, you risk your entire case as a bad faith petitioner.",

Because you charged the laptops so close to the date you filed your petition there is a presumption that you were planning to file your bankruptcy when you made the purchases.

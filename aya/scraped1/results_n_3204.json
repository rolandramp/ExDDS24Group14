    "title": "My husband is declaring bankrupcy and he is an authorized user on my credit cards. What do I do.",
    "question": "Should he list my credit cards on the bankrupcy, or should I call credit card company and have new cards issued solely in my name.",
    "answers": [
        "He is listing the debts he believes he is responsible for, even though he may not legally owe the debt. You should ask the CC companies to reissue cards solely in your name and that you are not filing BK.",
        "You would still be responsible for the cards if they are on your name. You can have him removed as an authorized user.",
        "have his authorized user cards cancelled and get cards solely in your name",
        "First, this assumes you are still together with him.\n\nSecond, any debt incurred during your marriage with him is community liability no matter what in CA with few exceptions not relevant here.\n\nThird, if together later it wont matter ..any debt incurred during marriage is both of yours.\n\nFourth, he must list all debts incurred during your marriage or he incurred before marrying you! Thus even if NOT in his name any card used by you during marriage with balance he must list!\n\nFifth, UNLIKE I BELIEVE EVERY OTHER ANSWER HEREIN I DONT BELIEVE YOU WILL BE LIABLE AT ALL AS LONG AS MARRIED TO HIM. A VERY RARE SECTION OF THE BANKRUPTCY CODE ATTORNEYS RARELY CITE (PROBABLY AS MOST ARE NOT IN COMMUNITY PROPERTY STATES) BUT 11 USC 524 WILL PROHIBIT THE CREDITORS COMING AFTER YOU ASSUMING YOU DID NOT FILE RECENTLY A BANKRUPTCY IN THE LAST 6 YEARS OR ABSENT A FRAUD TYPE CASE AND EVEN THEN THE CREDITOR MUST SUE YOU IN HIS BANKRUPTCY CASE!\n\nThus, all the marital debt will be discharged also! I welcome other attorneys comments on that section or agreement that my quotation is correct.\n\nYou need and want to enjoy your fresh start also. But the most important thing is to meet with an attorney as you asking this question means you have not. You care about 2 goals: keeping everything you have equity in and discharging all your debts. If you don't have any of the exceptions to discharge you will obtain that goal; most exceptions are set forth in 11 USC. 523 (Google it) like child support, some income taxes, traffic (in a ch 7) and criminal fines , and presumption of student loans. But some debts are dischargeable in a ch 13 but NOT in a ch 7 so you want to make sure and your attorney will discuss any such types with you also!\n\nYour exemptions depend on what state you have lived in in the last 2 years and thus if in your state, then your states exemptions will apply. Most persons filing keep everything they own but your attorney will confirm that with you when they learn everything you own and the equity thereof!\n\nSome secured debts like homes, vehicles, other secured debts an attorney will discuss your options on also as you must list any debts; but that does not mean you will lose them unless you have too much equity or are in default on paying for them! Discuss those options if they apply with your attorney too.\n\nBut other issues can arise that can greatly harm your case. Just one example: If you paid back a relative $3,000 11 months ago and now file bankruptcy next week, the trustee can SUE that relative to retrieve that $3,000 (under what is called a preference) for the benefit of the bankruptcy estate. As a result, most attorneys don't charge to meet with them the first meeting so meet with one no matter what.\n\nMany great attorneys can be found right here on AVVO in your state so look, call, and meet one as soon as you can.\n\nYou should also want to know when to file: is there an advantage of waiting versus filing now and who should you pay between now and then! Good luck and enjoy your later fresh start.",
        "You can contact the credit card company to remove him as an authorized user but it may still appear on your credit report that an authorized user or co-debtor filed a bankruptcy. Since you, presumably, will maintain current payments on the account it should not have much of an adverse impact on your credit. Keeping him on as an authorized user, or putting him back on after filing, will help him to rebuild his credit as the good payment history on your account will likely appear on his credit report.",
        "If you live in California and were married while the debts was incurred, then you both have liability on the credit card. Therefore, you husband will receive a discharge on the debt despite only being an authorized user. You can try to remove him from the account before he files which may allow you to keep the card. I recommend that your husband hire a bankruptcy attorney as there are some other issues that he needs to be aware of when spouses file without the other.",
        "You can take him off the cards. But you should have him include the debt to make sure that he is not liable for it. Also you will remain liable as you are the card holder.",
        "Your husband MUST list the credit cards on his bankruptcy because it I is debt and they are creditors subject to notice requirements. This however will not effect you or your credit report. His liability will be discharged and yours will remain. Just continue making payments. (This is similar to co-signor). Best of luck",
        "As an authorized user he is not responsible for the debt, he is merely authorized to make charges, which you must pay. So it should have no effect whatsoever on your credit cards. They are already solely in your name. But feel free to call and verify this information with them.",
        "You need to see of you can get separate credit. They may or may not allow you to. You will still be liable for all the debts in both names.\n\nsee https://www.mint.com/blog/credit/what-happens-to-my-debt-if-my-spouse-files-for-bankruptcy-0413/"

    "title": "What kind of assistance can a lawyer provide for a federal student loan debt crisis?",
    "question": "I owe $70,000 in federal student loans and with my current salary, even on an income driven repayment plan I am unable to make the monthly payments due to the high cost of living in California. I am an Registered Nurse with my Bachelors degree, which I received from Northern Arizona University. I am married and have one child. I am currently in a forbearance, but I am limited on how many months I can continue it. I made full and timely monthly payments on an income driven repayment plan for 5 years, but the payments did not cover the interest accruing, so my debt has continued to grow despite my payments. Now with my California salary my payments could be close to $800/month, which I can not afford. I was directed to Avvo for assistance through another law firm, that currently does not have assistance for federal loans. Please advise, any assistance or guidance would be greatly appreciated.",

        "Federal Bankruptcy is a complex area of law. More and more, across the country, some attorneys are focusing parts or all of their practices on student loan law. Engaging a College Debt attorney to help you navigate towards a student loan resolution is a good idea. College Debt attorneys can help you select a repayment plan, determine if you might qualify for loan forgiveness (for example, you mentioned you are a nurse - perhaps you qualify for Public Service Student Loan Forgiveness). I have written extensively on this subject here: CollegeDebtLaw.com",

        "I understand this is not the question being asked, but if you have 5 properties (assuming they are income generating revenue properties) it would be prudent to create a corporate entity to insulate them from personal liability and such. You can then put the shares to the corporation into the trust. Just an idea!",
        "To answer your question, assets in a revocable living trust can be transferred to an irrevocable trust. The next part of your question is more of a challenge. If the liability you are seeking protection from already exist, the transfers and the irrevocable trust will not likely provide you the protection you seek. You need to consult with an asset protection attorney to explore option, if any. You can contact the local bar association or try the Avvo Find a Lawyer tool.",
        "You can convert a revocable trust into an irrevocable one. If you already have liabilities when you do this and you are trying to avoid those, the court will likely not respect that. Once you convert the revocable trust to an irrevocable one you will no longer have the control you have now, in that you can not take the property out or change the trust, so be sure to consult with a reputable attorney to help you with this and to advise you as to the best option for your needs.\n\nIf you are trying to protect assets from a liability you already have, there is not really an option that the court will respect for that. If however you are just protecting for the possibility in the future, an attorney will likely be able to help you with this, in a way the court will be more likely to respect.",
        "The short answer is that it depends. Yes, you can transfer your real property from a revocable living trust to an irrevocable trust. Yes, that trust, with the right language, would protect the assets from creditors, but there are a whole lot of exceptions to that - for instance, if the IRS claim is for fraud in 2010, and the asset was held by you in 2010, and was not transferred to the trust until 2015, then the asset itself is probably fair game. Further, there are an entire host of ways that a court could interpret the trust as having the authority/obligation to pay your debts, or would interpret the creation of the irrevocable trust as an intent to avoid/defraud creditors. You really really will want to consult with a reputable trust/estate attorney on this."

    "title": "If my “friend” sends me money through PayPal using a credit card and I send it back to her can a dispute with bank be filed?",
    "question": "My “friend” asked me to do her a favor and if she send money off her credit card Could I send it back to her because she was “in a bind.” Well she sent me 3 transactions. Only one of which I truly agreed to but that’s besides the point. Fast forward a few days later and claims have been filed with the credit card company for unauthorized use. I didn’t realize at the time but she sent the money as though I was a merchant, not sure if that matters. Anyway...PayPal rules in her favor after I respond to them informing what happened. So I filed a claim With PayPal re the money I sent back to her and showed them documents I had showing that she sent and received the money. Well, PayPal denied my claim saying I sent using friends and family so this cannot be disputed.",

    "title": "Cash purchase of a house during Chapter 13?",
    "question": "We are 2 1/2 years into Chapter 13 and are current on everything. We are upside down on our mortgage. We owe 400,000, value is 220,000. We have an opportunity to purchase another home for 170,000, well under market. This is an opportunity for us to have a secure place to live as our children grow and move away. In our view, it would be worth a withdraw from 401k to pay in cash and own the house outright. We would then like to short sell our current or if necessary, convert to a Chapter7. My obvious questions all amount to one which is, can we do any of this while we are in Chapter 13?",
    "answers": [
        "Why are not you talking to your bk lawyer about this? Why not convert to CH. 7 now, get rid of the outstanding obligations under the existing mortgage note as well as other debts and then purchase a house?\n\nFurther, depending on many factors, it is very possible that you may end up owning the house where you currently live long after you receive your BK discharge. There is no way to compel a lender to foreclose on a property or take possession of a property. We have many clients who were discharged in a 7 or 13, purchased new homes, and the lenders decided not to bother with the foreclosure on their old properties.. All of them are now being sued by HOAs.\n\nThere are quite a few additional issues that should be reviewed with your bk counsel:\n\n1. Are there any joint debt obligations?\n2. IRS/state tax debt?\n3. The effect of converting on any avoided liens.",
        "You wrote, \"My obvious questions all amount to one which is, can we do any of this while we are in Chapter 13?\"\n\nA: No.",
        "Timing is everything, and if you qualify to convert to a Chapter 7, I would do it now rather than after you purchase the new home. Hope this perspective helps!",
        "Yes, but there are several moving parts here. Selling your house may require action (if that is what you are doing), and you may want to get a \"comfort order\" notifying everyone that you are using exempt assets to purchase your new home. Also you will almost assuredly have to modify your current Chapter 13 in order to surrender the current house and discharge the remaining debt.\n\nBottom line: get your Chapter 13 lawyer involved right away and they will know what to do to get this handled.\n\nGood luck!"

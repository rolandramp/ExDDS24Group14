        "You have a couple of things going on here. First, you did not identify what chapter your parents filed, 7 or 13. If they filed a Chapter 13, you would be protected absent a motion filed in their bk.\n\nIf they filed a Chapter 7 and obtain their discharge, then they could come after you. More importantly here, is the fact that your parents filed BK and a state court lawsuit was filed also. Was the lawsuit filed before, or after they filed for bk? They need to make sure they have that issued addressed by their bk attorney.\nYou will have to consult with your own bk attorney and have your options reviewed.",
        "Your parents' bankruptcy would not discharge your personal obligation to pay. You would have to file your own bankruptcy.",
        "Unfortunately, the only joint filing permitted is one by spouses. So, while your parents can jointly file bankruptcy and obtain a discharge benefiting both, it will not serve to discharge your liability on the joint debt. You will need to file your own bankruptcy proceeding.",
        "Some debts cannot be discharged through bankruptcy, for example, student loans. However if its not a student loan its likely that it can be discharged through her bankruptcy case. Unfortunately, YOU cannot discharge YOUR obligation someone else's bankruptcy.\n\nIf this question relates to a student loan, you might want to post a new question with more specifics about that loan. Most other consumer debts can be discharged in a bankruptcy case.",
        "Probably; most debts in contracts between individuals are dischargeable unless there is some kind of fraud in the inducement of the contract."

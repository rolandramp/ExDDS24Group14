    "title": "Am I Liable for a Debt Collector's Legal Fees?",
    "question": "I got sued for medical debt by a debt collector. My insurance company asked me not to pay the bill because they were sorting out some coding issues with the provider, who went ahead and took me to collections anyway. My insurance company has now settled with the provider. I asked the provider to straighten it out with the debt collector which they did. The debt collector says they will go ahead and get the case dismissed but they want me to pay their legal fees. Please advise. Thanks.",

        "You haven't said how much that is. The smaller the amount, the stronger I would lean towards paying it to be done with the whole thing.\n\nIn all events, you are not liable for any lawyer fees unless your agreement to pay the doctor is in writing, and provides for the recovery of fees. And, there may be other defenses. Most medical fee agreements usually say that the matter will be taken to arbitration. If that is what your agreement states, the collection agency has apparently breached the agreement by filing the matter in a court instead of seeking arbitration.\n\nIf you truly want to know where you stand, visit a lawyer for advice and take the pertinent papers with you.",
        "If there is some legitimate basis for you having to pay their legal fees and you cannot afford to pay it or make payments on it then you may want to consider your bankruptcy options. It just depends on your situation and how much you owe their legal fees and how much you owe on your legal fees. More information is needed to be of better help to you. Feel free to contact a bankruptcy attorney here on AVVO as many of us offer free consultations.",
        "They would have no legal basis for requiring you to pay for attorney fees when they are the one's dismissing the case. You might want to have your insurance company contact the debt collection agency to avoid paying their attorney fees.",
        "So is there a court judgment saying you have to pay the legal fees or not? Did the contract you entered into with the original creditor say you agreed to pay legal fees for collection? Please don't ask me to guess about what important documents might or might not say. I need to keep my crystal ball in shape for the next Powerball payoff! Hope this perspective helps!"

    "title": "Debt passed statute of limitations. However written contract signed which extended sol before medical treatment was given.",
    "question": "I have some old medical debt. That appears to be past the statute of limitations for CA. However, before I had the treatment. The intake contract, included stipulation to extend the Statute of Limitations an additional four years. Would this be legally enforceable and considered a tolling agreement under 360.5?",
    "answers": [
        "If the intake contract contained a term that extended the statute of limitations, and you had capacity (you weren't unconscious or otherwise unable to agree), AND you signed the agreement, then it is probably enforceable. Most contracts are enforceable, unless the contract is illegal or against public policy. If you are sued, contact a debt collection defense attorney that has experience with medical debts."

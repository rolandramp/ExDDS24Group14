    "title": "Preliminary/Final Disclosures Documents in divorce",
    "question": "I am the respondent. I already filed my response and now I have to file preliminary disclosure documents. Is it ok to submit one set of documents (FL140, FL141, FL142, FL150, FL335) with required exhibits and tick both Preliminary and Final boxes as there will be no change in these documents content. Or do I have to file preliminary and final disclosures separately even though these will have same content. Actually, I already mailed this set of documents to the court today (marked both Preliminary and Final). Will these be rejected?",
    "answers": [
        "If you are at a stage where you already have the documents to attach to your Schedule of Assets and Debts (reflecting ownership of property, bank statements, pensions, credit card statements, etc.), then you should be able to check both Preliminary and Final to these forms. Be detailed.",
        "I agree with some of the answers above, you do not need to file the Schedule of Assets and Debts or the Income and Expense Declaration. The only document that requires filing is the Declaration Regarding the Service of these documents. That said, the Court will not reject your filing simply because both boxes are checked. However, I must advise you that if your matter proceeds to trail, you may still have to complete a second set of the documents prior to trial as some of the disclosure information will change (balances in bank accounts etc.).",
        "The preliminary declaration of disclosure with its exhibits is usually served very early in the case. In most cases (but not all) the final declaration of disclosure is done up to a year or more later and therefore all of the statements/exhibits need to be updated and asset information will likely have changed or will need to be updated by the time the parties are ready to exchagne their final declarations of dislcosure. If you end up settling and not going to trial, the parties can waive the exchange of the final declarations of disclsoure. In either case, the ONLY thing you file with the court is the declaration regarding service of the declaration of disclosure.",
        "The final and preliminary declaration of disclosures are not file with the court but are exchanged with the other party. You only need to file what is called a Declaration of Preliminary Declaration of Disclosure or Final Disclosure."

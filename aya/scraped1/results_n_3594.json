    "title": "BK 7 discharged 3 years ago. Collection agency for lienholder refusing to release title until paid off. How do I get my title?",
    "question": "BK discharged in 2011. HSBC sold the loan/debt to Resurgent collection agency. Both parties were discharged through the BK. We had to write off the debt in our 2010 taxes. This was an HSBC credit card where we purchased a quad, dirt bike, and street motorcycle. HSBC put a lien on it. How do we get Resurgent to remove themselves from the title? They had the opportunity in the court hearings to request the vehicle back and/or reaffirm the debt which they chose not to do. I live in CA. We want to sell the vehicles and need the title to be clear. I have faxed over my request and documentation that it was discharged in the BK, but Resurgent has said they still will not send me a clear title. HELP please.",

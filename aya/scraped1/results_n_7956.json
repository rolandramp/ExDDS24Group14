    "title": "Can you borrow money after the 341 but before chapter 7 discharge?",
    "question": "I have seen at different legal websites that you can't acquire new debt while a bankruptcy case is active - even during a chapter 7.",
    "answers": [
        "I agree with the other answers, with one qualification. You should not take out a loan secured by your property (such as a home equity line of credit or auto title loan) until your case is closed. Technically, your assets are part of your \"bankruptcy estate\" until your case has been fully administered, so taking out a loan secured by your assets should not be done without a court order.",
        "To my knowledge there is no restriction upon borrowing but part of the reason you have filed bankruptcy is to be free of debt-- why take more on? A chapter 7 gives a debtor a clean slate and I hate to think you will be owing someone even before the ink dries on your discharge from the court.",
        "If you are in Chapter 7 you can acquire new debt. I agree with the other attorney who answered your question. I would qualify my answer with a big IF, if you can find someone who will lend money to you. The purpose of your chapter 7 discharge is to give you a fresh start. I would encourage you to borrow money for an important purpose, to assist you in your fresh start. You can file bankruptcy only every 8 years, so be sure that you can use the new funds wisely. Also I encourage you to seek the advice of an attorney in your area. There are restrictions on borrowing new funds during chapter 13 and chapter 11, you must have court approval.",
        "If you were in a chapter 13 case. you cannot acquire new debt without court and trustee permission while the case is active. If you are in a chapter 7 I know of no restrictions on borrowing if you can find someone to lend to you, which may be the major hurdle. In chapter 11 borrowings are frequent when the debtor is putting together a plan of reorganization."

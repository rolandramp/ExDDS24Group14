        "I can answer your questions with some general guidelines. Since your brother-in-law died in South Carolina but his residence is in Georgia, the Georgia court has jurisdiction over his estate. Title to the house in Georgia will depend on Georgia law and how the property is titled. In California, if the house was in joint tenancy between husband and wife, the surviving wife would receive title without going through probate. You need to consult a Georgia attorney. The State where property resided has jurisdiction over the property and the California property may have to go through an ancillary probate in California unless title is held as joint tenancy between husband and wife.\nThe answer to all of your other questions depend on Georgia law pertaining to responsibility for debts, medical bills, etc. In California, a spouse is responsible, in most instances, for debts and final medical expenses of a deceased spouse. However, because of the State of residence, Georgia law will apply.\nConsult a Georgia attorney for a proper answer to your questions.",
        "Just to add to Mr. Carrier's answer. Real estate must always be probated in the state in which it is. This even applies to timeshares in most states. Thus, because I live in Las Vegas which is a vacation destination, I get a lot of request to do ancillary probates of timeshares in cases in which the main probate was done in a different state.",
        "Primary probate in Georgia, ancillary probate in Cali\nThis will get her the real property as well as the various items of personal property held by the sheriff.\nShe is not personally liable, but the assets in the estate are liable for the debts"

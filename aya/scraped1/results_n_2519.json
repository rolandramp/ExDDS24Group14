    "title": "Can a Chapter 7 Trustee sell a Debtor's real property when the Trustee is aware the potential buyer is engaging in fraud?",
    "question": "Foremost, PLEASE KNOW, I have been trying to retain an attorney for 2 months with no success. NOBODY will take my case at this juncture. I own a home valued at $460,000; approximately $260,000 still owed DIRECTLY RESULTING from a $200,000 down payment I personally made from inheritance funds. I am in the midst of a divorce and my husband has arranged for 'his parents' (because it would be illegal for him to do it) to make a $145,000 offer on the home \"subject to any and all claims of lien, encumbrance,\" etc. My husband then intends to FLIP the home for his personal gain; this, coupled with his sharing of the $100,000 H.E. ensures I cannot recover my personal investment. The Trustee knows all of this. Should the Trustee have declined the offer due to the underlying illegal activity?",
    "answers": [
        "I feel that you have valuable property rights to assert, and immediate action needs to be taken by you. Among things to consider will be an opposition to the trustee's motion to approve the proposed sale; a motion for relief from automatic stay so that you can have a divorce trial where you will seek reimbursement from community property for the amount of your down payment, and immediately filing a proof of claim in the BK case. You might even file an action in the bankruptcy court seeking such a determination, and ask the bankruptcy court to decide all the issues, or else grant relief so that you can try your issues in divorce court.\n\nI wish you had provided more info as to why you have not been able to retain an attorney. If you will do so, perhaps the lawyers participating here will have some practical suggestions to help you.",
        "Respectfully, I do not see any fraud. The trustee's obligation is to obtain the highest and best price for the residence so that there is the most money to distribute to unsecured creditors.\n\nYou certainly can make the circumstances known to the trustee and the trustee may choose to further expose the property to the market. However, a trustee's sale is a distressed sale and if the trustee considers the parent's offer fair, I don't know how you can stop the sale.\n\nBTW, the time to have consulted and retain qualified Chapter 7 bankruptcy counsel was before you filed, not after.

        "I would need more information to analyze the situation. Like how much in other debt do you owe to start. Do you have an attorney in your chapter 7?",
        "Wihout getting into the facts of your case-- which are, as noted by other counsel, complex -- a bankruptcy sale is ALWAYS an auction. If the property is worth more than the amount being offered by your inlaws then overbids will be accepted. Contact anyone who has expressed and interest or a real estate agent or convince the trustee to market the property for a longer period of time so overbidders can come to the hearing.\nYou state that the offer is being made subject to existing liens and encumbrances (in other words the inlaws will need to assume the liens and encumbrances on the property.) Most deeds of trust have a due on sale clause which they will enforce if the property is sold without their consent. Have you checked with the secured lender on the house? If they have not approved the inlaws to assume the loan and have a due on sale clause, they may object to the sale if they are not paid in full.",
        "\"Illegal\" means \"in violation of a specific law\". What you say may or may not be \"not right\" but it is not illegal and it is the trustee's job to take the best offer. If your home is truly worth more, someone will make a better offer, if the house is on the market. What you paid has absolutely nothing to do with what it is worth today, and bankruptcies often include homes that have not been kept up as well as they had been or are in areas where the value has dropped.\nTo \"flip\" a home includes putting work into it. If your home needs work, and a buyer puts work into it, you are not \"entitled\" to the money the home will be worth in great condition, if it needs work. If it DOESN'T need work, someone will offer you the same as they would offer your husband.\nThere is likely a reason no lawyer will take your case, and sometimes the simplest explanation is the best - that perhaps you have no case.",
        "Sacramento has many very good bankruptcy attorney who can assist you. However, as indicated, perhaps the goal you wish to achieve cannot be accomplished and that is why the attorneys have declined to take you on as a client. Absent some details, it is very hard to comment otherwise."

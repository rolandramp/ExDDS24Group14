        "BK is not a DIY project. Find/consult/hire a BK lawyer ASAP. According to stats from the US Trustee, virtually all non-lawyer assisted 13s are dismissed. That said, it may not make any difference how many dependants you have if you have no problem passing the feasibility/budget analysis using 3 dependents (yourself, plus 1.5 of the 3 kids which you have 50/50 custody). Some of us offer a free consultation by phone. Take us up on it.",
        "If you are paying the expenses of your children on a regular basis, the household size would be 4. The means test can be complex and you would want to have an experienced bankruptcy attorney's advice. Chapter 13 cases are much more involved than Chapter 7 cases. Most bankruptcy attorneys offer a free consultation.",
        "In my district you would have a household of 3. Actually 2.5 but since our judges don't recognize fractional children, you round up. You have you (1) + your kids (3) @ half time.(1.5). So you have 2.5 people in your household. Many but not all courts use this method. You're best served by consulting with and retaining a local bankruptcy attorney to determine how your district handles this issue.",
        "Not hard & fast answer to this question I am afraid. What does your domestic order say about tax exemptions for the kids? And If I looked at how much you pay for the kids' support vs how much your ex pays for them, what would the numbers indicate? And why don't you retain a qualified Chapter 13 attorney in your community to help you make this decision? Filing Chapter 13 is mostly about the legal strategy, and plenty of people fail at Chapter 13 because they have unrealistic expectations and no defined goals. Hope this perspective helps!"

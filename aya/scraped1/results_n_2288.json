    "title": "HOW DOES AFFIRMATION OF MORTGAGE LOAN IN CHAPTER 7 BANKRUPTCY WORK?",
    "question": "I have a property that was under foreclosure process, I was under a trial payment and then filed a chapter 7 bk, I stated that I wanted to affirm the debt on my paperwork but I was never provided a reaffirmation agreement. My mortgage servicer instead lifted the automatic stay. Is the loan servicer responsible for providing a reaffirmation agreement? or am I supposed to contact them for it? can anyone provide a Federal Code regarding affirmation of real property during bankruptcy? or a law in regards to reaffirmation contracts? please help.",
    "answers": [
        "It is 100% within the lenders discretion to offer you a reaffirmation. Most won't, no matter what, others won't unless payments are current. While you are welcome to apply for a new modification after your Chapter 7 is discharged, if you can't work out a deal before a foreclosure sale is scheduled, you may have to file another bankruptcy under Chapter 13 to save your property. Too bad you didn't have an attorney to caution you against filing while in the trial period. Hope this perspective helps!",
        "You need to find a lawyer to review the loan modification terms and the motion to lift the automatic stay. My colleagues here are correct regarding reaffirmations and you should not sign them.\n\nTo your question about the loan mod, there is no right to one, regardless of reaffirmation agreements. The fact that you filed Chapter 7 while still in the trial phase may have started the process over again, as the Chapter 7 fundamentally alters the nature of your mortgage and your financial situation. One can hope their motion to lift the stay was for them to complete the modification process rather than resume foreclosure, but we do not have those details here.",
        "If you are in default in a chapter 7, the bank does not have to offer you a reaffirmation or even attempt to negotiate a modification for that matter. If you are in default, and the bank is not willing to modify your loan (and it appears that they are not willing to do so) they can, and will, file a motion for relief from the stay which will allow them to proceed with the foreclosure in State court, however, the Order from the bankruptcy court will specifically forbid them from seeking monetary damages from you. In other words, the Court will allow the bank to go after the house, but they can't come after you for any money.",
        "Never reaffirm a mortgage debt. California has an anti-deficiency statue which means that if you can't make your payments in the future, all the lender can do is take the property through foreclosure; the lender cannot come after you for the difference between what you owe and what the lender got at foreclosure. If you sign a reaff, you have agreed to be personally responsible for that difference. Whether the loan mod went out the window when you filed bankruptcy is another question and that depends on the loan mod agreement.",
        "Reaffirmation of debt is a serious matter which should never be undertaken without legal assistance, and an understanding of the consequences of signing it, then defaulting. You could find a consumer bankruptcy attorney on AVVO or use the link below."

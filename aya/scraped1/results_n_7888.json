        "First, you or your representative should be present at all hearings. Second an example of default is where you serve divorce papers on someone and they don't bother to file a response with the court. Sometimes, you can even have a person's pleadings stricken by the court and then proceed with default.",
        "A review hearing is synonymous with a status conference. The court wants an update on what is happening with the case and if it is going forward. A default hearing is where they hear the default while the request is simply request to default the other party."

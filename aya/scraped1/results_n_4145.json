        "The real question is whether or not your civil litigation case was file prior to you filing your BK Petition. If so, you should have listed it as a possible asset. Moreover, if this (done prior to your filing BK) the automatic stay should have been in place prohibiting the civil case from proceeding, especially the defendant obtaining a judgment against you. I think you have a decent argument that the debt or the reasonable foreseeability of it arose prior to the filing of the BK. Basically, all debts incurred prior to the filing of the BK are subject to being discharged. Thus, since your case is still open you should amend your schedules and add him as a creditor. If your case is what is called a \"no asset\" case then this should be a simple procedure.",
        "Any liability which arose prior to the date you filed your bankruptcy can be part of the bankruptcy. In fact, it should have already been disclosed to the Trustee. In the Tenth Circuit, if you are a no asset case (the trustee does not take any of your property and pay a dividend to your creditors) , even undisclosed creditors are discharged. The Ninth Circuit, where you are, may be different. In any case, you need to amend the schedules to disclose the omitted creditor. See a bankruptcy attorney right away. Do not wait. This is one of those cases where trying to save money by doing your own bankruptcy may end up costing you much more than if you have hired an attorney in the first place.",

If not too late, I would do as one attorney indicated to amend the schedules and make sure listed in all places noted by the attorneys, but you might also file a motion for reconsideration of the civil case judge that any attorneys fees you are liable for should ONLY be post petition fees as the others would be discharged upon you receiving a discharge! Good luck...Because you indicate you already made payments on the judgment, your time with the court may have expired possibly but talk to an attorney on that. But if so, maybe a motion in Bankruptcy Court to find that the portion of attorney fees awarded in the civil court that were incurred pre petition should be found to be discharged. Maybe an agreed order with the other attorney awarded the fees could resolve it also if they agree or you can threaten additional fees for violation of the discharge. Finally, unless your debt falls w/in one of the exceptions to discharge, do not forget you can always do a chapter 13..but waiting till 4 yrs after the ch 7 petition date if possible may cause you to have to pay out less monies than the 100% requirement if you file less than 4 yrs after the ch 7 date.

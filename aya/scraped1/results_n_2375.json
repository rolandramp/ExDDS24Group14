    "title": "Can a partially paid promissory note be transferred to third party? The debtor is in bankruptcy.",
    "question": "I have a promissory note from a debtor and debtor paid 1/3rd of money.The debtor is in bankruptcy. The note does not have transfer clause exclusively. Also the note does not have restriction of transfer as well. Can this note be transferred to a third party. What happens if trustee wants to file preferential for the already paid payment? Does any one has an idea in these kind of situations?",
    "answers": [
        "As other attorneys have said, unless you are an insider, preferential payments are limited to those made in the 90 day period prior to the filing of the bankruptcy case. Also, if the payments were in the ordinary course of business you would have a good defense against any such recovery. Finally, for a consumer debtor, a trustee can only take steps to recover such preference payments if the aggregate of the payments within the 90 days prior to bankruptcy exceed $600. There may be other defenses as well. See a lawyer if push comes to shove.\n\nThe idea of alienating the note sounds like it has some devious quality. If you were to sell the note without disclosing the bankruptcy case of the debtor, as if the note had the unpaid value, I would think that equates to fraud on the person you sold it to. You will really need a lawyer then.",
        "If the debtor made payment to you within 90 days of filing bankruptcy then the trustee has the right to ask you for the money paid within that 90 day period. If you are an insider, have a special relationship to the debtor, husband, wife, brother, sister, trustee, child father something along those lines then the preference period is a year. As to transferring the note, that is not likely. It is a debt and the debtor's obligation to you will be eliminated unless you have taken collateral. If you have taken collateral as security, you may only look to the collateral for payment and you have to take steps in the bankruptcy to get relief from stay before taking and selling the collateral. If the collateral does not bring you enough to cover the balance then you are out of luck for the shortfall. If it brings in more, then you have to turn the excess over to the trustee.",
        "The Note is a debt and as such should be listed in Schedule F (if is unsecured). You are a creditor of the bankrupt debtor. You are free to transfer the Note as you see fit, but, who is likely to pay anything for a note from a bankrupt debtor? As far as the trustee seeking to recover payments paid within 90 days of the debtor's filing date, a transfer will do nothing to prevent that. Remember, BK is not a DIY project. You need help from a BK creditor's rights lawyer. Click the Avvo tab, \"Find a Lawyer\". Many of us give free case analyses. Preference law is a minefield for the non-attorney. Consult with a lawyer ASAP.",
        "I agree with attorney Lysle. The note is likely transferrable, but who is going to buy a note that is subject to discharge in bankruptcy? Depending on when the debtor made payments on the note, the amounts, the relationship of the parties, and other factors, the trustee may pursue a preference action against the note holder to recover all or a portion of the payments made. There are defenses to preference actions, but transfer of the note to a third party isn't one of them. Definitely consult counsel.",
        "Unless there are facts which have not been included in your message, the holder of the note has the right to transfer the note to someone else. In regards to the Trustee seeking to recover money paid, more facts are necessary. Transfer of the note will not prevent the Trustee from going after the original holder of the note. You should probably meet with a bankruptcy attorney before you create an additional problem."

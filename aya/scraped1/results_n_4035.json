    "title": "If a mortgage is discharge in Ch 7 BK, can the bank foreclose if you stay current after discharge?",
    "question": "I had a mortgage discharged in Ch7 on Jan7, 2014. I'm remaining in the home and am in a HAMP trial period. I have made current monthly payments to the HAMP Trial for Jan and Feb 2014.",
    "answers": [
        "To stay in the property requires you to make all contracted payments. If your HAMP modification is addressing the arrearages, these letters may be an oversight, but I would be on the phone to find out whether the HAMP agreement addresses your arrearages or not. If you are keeping your house, you keep all the payments, irrespective of your bankruptcy discharge and reprieve under the bankruptcy stay! Hope this perspective helps!",
        "The quick answer is yes, if you are not current on past due mortgage payments then they can foreclose and take the property. Your personal liability as to those payments is discharged but they can still foreclose on the home.\n\nThe bigger question here is if you are on a trial modification and you have made all those trial modification payments on time then you should be approve for a permanent modification and the lender should not foreclose unless you possibly missed a trial modification payment and the lender has given you written denial for a permanent modification and the appeal time has elapsed. Otherwise, with the trial modification, if you followed all their instructions, you should receive a permanent modification and be current on your mortgage and out of foreclosure.",
        "Generally, yes they can. You say you know how liability works, but you seem to be confused about \"past due payments discharged in Bankruptcy.\" The entire debt was discharged, if not reaffirmed. Now the lender can choose to foreclose if they choose."

        "Probably, as explained by my Avvo colleagues. You should be liable if the crime were committed on behalf of the community and, if it wasn't and you divorce, you should seek by negotiation to have it awarded to husband and have him hold you harmless as to it.",
        "You are not required to pay restitution for a criminal conviction any more than you would be required to serve a spouse time, if the restitution is part of a criminal conviction. On the other hand if it is a tort in civic court, and the judgment was only against the spouse, then the plaintiff can come after community income if the couple is still together. This issue is a lot more complicated and more information would be required to understand exactly what it is you want to know. Every case is different, and one fact can change the answer... so without all the facts in the case it is impossible to respond fully.",
        "This is actually a heated issue in family law right now. It depends somewhat on the nature of the crime, but I'm afraid that the answer is probably yes.\n\nThe case of United States v. Berger, No. 08-50415 (9th Cir., Jul. 31, 2009), illustrates the seemingly unfair liability an innocent spouse might have due to the criminal conduct of his or her spouse. In that case, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals determined that the community property, including that portion which otherwise would be awarded upon dissolution of marriage to an innocent spouse, may utilized under the Mandatory Victim Restitution Act (MVRA) (18 U.S.C. ยง 3663(a)) to satisfy a restitution judgment obtained against a criminally liable spouse.\n\nIf you are considering divorce, then I highly encourage you to speak with a family law attorney."

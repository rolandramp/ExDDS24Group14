    "question": "My spouse won a law suit involving a surgical Mesh for $45,000. She is unable to collect this money until an issue with a bankruptcy we filed back in 2012 is taken care of. We were told by the law firm that they are holding the money and that we would have to reopen the bankruptcy in order to collect the money. I'm not sure why. But I also just found out that there are liens on my home placed prior to my bankruptcy that still exists. I thought these liens were taken care of during my bankruptcy back in 2012. I need advice and representation to solve my problems. Does any one have any advice and that would like to take my case? My bankruptcy was filed in San Diego if that helps. What type of attorney do I need to seek to take care of these issues?",

        "As D J said, your first stop is with the attorney who filed your case.\nIf unsuccessful there, you need to reopen your case and list the cause of action and exempt it.\nOnce disclosed and exempted, the money can be released to you.\nThe liens are another matter ... they remained after your BK, but they may be able to be removed. The issue will then become, \"does removing those liens create additional non-exempt equity in your home that your BK Trustee will want to pay to your creditors out of your settlement?\" That seems unlikely since you saqy you didn't know about the liens at the time.",
        "You need to go back and have a chat with the attorney who filed your bankruptcy case. That would be a good place to start.",
        "Perhaps a BANKRUPTCY attorney would be able to help since the issue involves a bankruptcy..."

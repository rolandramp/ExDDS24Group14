        "You only have a few options at this point: You could try and set aside the judgment and defend on the merits, but I'm not sure you will have much of a defense to assert, as you are responsible for your HOA dues. You can defend against each collection procedure (wage garnishment, bank levy, etc.) by filing a claim of exemption, but you are likely going to end up having to make some regular monthly payment that the the court determines reasonable. Alternatively, you could talk to a bankruptcy attorney and seek bankruptcy protection.",
        "You should have filed an Answer when you were served with Summons and Complaint. If you could not afford the filing fee, you could have asked that it be waived. Now, unless you file a motion to set aside the default, you are limited to filing a Claim of Exemption if they attempt to garnish your wages.",
        "If the HOA has a money judgment against you, the HOA can enforce its judgment by levying your bank accounts and garnishing your wages.\n\nIf you are a debtor in California who has difficulty satisfying a judgment after being served with a Writ of Execution, you can file a Claim of Exemption along with a Financial Statement. A Claim of Exemption is a form a debtor files with the levying officer (like the sheriff) explaining why the wages that the creditor wants the debtor’s employer to garnish should be exempt (excluded).\n\nThe forms are:\n\nhttp://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/wg006.pdf\n\nhttp://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/wg007.pdf\n\nTurn in 2 copies of the Claim of Exemption (Form WG-006) and the Financial Statement (Form WG-007) to the levying officer in your case (like the sheriff) within 10 days of receiving the Notice of Levy. Keep one copy of both forms for yourself.\n\nYour employer will hold on to the money garnished until 10 days go by and the creditor hasn’t opposed the claim of exemption, or the judge makes a decision at the hearing on the claim of exemption. If the creditor doesn’t oppose your claim of exemption, your employer will return the wages to you. If the creditor opposes your claim of exemption, you will receive a Notice of Opposition to Claim of Exemption and Notice of Hearing on Claim of Exemption that will set a court date for a judge to make a decision. If the judge agrees with your claim of exemption, you will get the money back. If the judge agrees with the creditor, your employer will send the money to the creditor every month.\n\nFor Claim of Exemption for non-wage garnishments, use Form EJ-160 instead of WG-006:\n\nhttp://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/ej160.pdf\n\nFor a list of current exemptions in California, see:\n\nhttp://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/ej155.pdf"

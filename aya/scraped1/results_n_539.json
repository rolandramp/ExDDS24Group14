    "title": "Does it seem likely that collection agencies will pursue judgments against me if I can't make payments on their terms?",
    "question": "In Oct '18 I was at fault for a 3-car crash. My insurance of over 20 yrs had quietly lapsed. I have been contacted by 2 collection agencies demanding subrogation payment. I agree that I owe the ~$12,000 but I can't pay it. I work a part-time job 47 miles from my home making 266/week. Most of my paychecks go to food, basic bills, and reimbursing a coworker who drives me to and from work. I have 300 dollars in my bank account. An asset check will reveal I have no other income or property of value. My options to improve my financial situation are limited. My car was totaled and I released it to the storage yard for sale through DMV, and my DL license was suspended by DMV. One collection agency won't put the low payment plan they agreed to in writing as I requested, and the other rejected the highest monthly payment I can afford. Bankruptcy over $4800 and $6800 respectively feels like overreaction but I'm concerned that judgments and bank levies will do more damage than bankruptcy if I can't improve my financial situation in the near future.",

Make sure you do not leave larger sums of money in your bank account and do not disclose any of your financial details to the collection agencies which likely will be contracting you.

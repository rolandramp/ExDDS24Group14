    "title": "I filed for BK while being sued in a civil suit. My BK has been discharged but the plaintiff hasn't dropped the case. What now?",
    "question": "When I got served as a defendant in an unlimited civil suit, with no means for a lawyer, I filed for Chap 7 using a prepaid legal lawyer. The person suing me was listed as a creditor and was notified (along with their lawyers and the court) that I filed. It seemed that the stay never took place because a case management conference took place during the stay and was rescheduled. Now, I've received a discharge but the judge (in the civil suit) issued something saying if I don't file a response I could be subject to sanctions. My BK lawyer (who now will not help) said once it was discharged the case should be dismissed. What should I do? I don't want to pay fines but I don't know how to let the court know that the claim against me is discharged. Their lawyer doesn't respond to my calls.",

        "I agree with all of the attorneys answering your question.\n\nMany years back my firm was involved with a newly-minted judge in a civil case. A suggestion of bankruptcy was filed. The state court judge refused to stay the case.\n\nThe bankruptcy judge was an old hand at this, and called up the state court judge and invited him to lunch.\n\nThe next day the case was sua sponte dismissed. I had heard that the state court judge was surprised, as he said, that he could be \"hauled off in leg irons for ignoring the discharge injunction.\"\n\nMy only question is what is the civil case in state court about? What are they suing you for? If its one of the debts excepted from discharge in 11 USC 523, then they may have a leg to stand on.",
        "It would be worthwhile to try the following: make a copy of your discharge order issued by the bankruptcy court as well as the list of recipients. Send a letter (via Certified Mail with signature delivery) to the attorney who represents the plaintiff. The letter should state that the plaintiff was listed as a creditor and that the debt/claim has been discharged. You should also notify the superior court judge that issued any case management order -- sending a copy of the discharge order and the letter that was sent to opposing counsel should be adequate.\n\nThe superior court judge does not know about the discharge because the Notice of Stay was never filed, but once that information is received, the court would then not require you to do anything further. Contact a consumer attorney or debt collection defense attorney if the problem does not get resolved.",
        "I had this happen in one of my cases. I actually had to file a motion to dismiss the case and attached a copy of the discharge and schedules listing the debt to the motion. In my case I wasn't dealing with a malicious plaintiff; I was dealing with an inattentive attorney who didn't know anything about bankruptcy law.",
        "Your debt is discharged, and the creditor is violating the discharge injunction. The creditor can be compelled to pay money damages for intentionally continuing the collection effort. Your BK lawyer is correct. When you filed your BK, listed the debt, including the lawyer representing the creditor, you have done what is required. A thorough BK lawyer would also notify the State Court by using the form suggested by others. Once you file the Notice of Stay form with a copy of your Notice of Filing, any judge who ignores that will do so at his/her peril. It has been my experience that a BK notice sent to the State court is like a poison pill. Far from you being sanctioned, the State Court and the plaintiff creditor are in real danger of being sanctioned.",
        "Attorney Ruthven has provided the document. In reality, the plaintiff should after they receive the discharge notice, then file a motion to dismiss assuming there are not any codebtor's. As a matter of law, any attempt to award any damages against you would be in violation of the bankruptcy discharge provisions. But do send a notice to that civil court and a copy of the discharge and indicating you have no objections to the case being dismissed. In some states, the plaintiff cannot dismiss w/o your consent depending on various factors beyond the scope of this forum. Good luck on your new start and order your credit reports 45 days after discharge and object to any thing that is untrue or shows a debt owed..they should state \"zero owed, discharged in bankruptcy\". Have a great Sunday night!",
        "You can send the state court a letter along with your petition, your 341 notice and your discharge that this liability was discharged in your bankruptcy. If that does not take care of it, you would need to file for relief in the bankruptcy court for violation of the discharge order by the creditor. You should not be doing these things on your own. If your lawyer is not calling you back, then you ought to find other experienced bankruptcy counsel in your area and schedule an appointment.",
        "Your bankruptcy attorney should have filed form CM-180, NOTICE OF STAY OF PROCEEDINGS, along with a copy of your Notice of Bankruptcy Filing, with the court in which the lawsuit against you was filed and also with the attorneys for the party suing you.

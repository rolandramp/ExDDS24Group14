    "question": "my spouse will be filling alone chapter 13. I am receiving ihss income will that be counted as disposable income?",
    "answers": [
        "Yes. IHSS is income for purpose of determining C13 plan payment amount and feasibility of C13 plan.\nDisposable income is term used in calculating Means Test and eligibility to file C13.\nCarefully distinguish each in determining which chapter appropriate and in your best interests..",
        "It will be counted as part of your household income. However, you may be able to deduct all or part of it to the extend that it is not used for joint living expenses.",
        "I agree with the other lawyers who have answered this question. IHSS is considered \"income\" in chapter 13 and will be considered in determining the amount of your plan payment. But as the other attorneys mentioned, there are a lot of moving parts in chapter 13, so it would be wise to consult with and hire an attorney to represent you. Very few people who represent themselves in chapter 13 are successful. Many, if not most, bankruptcy lawyers offer a free initial consultation.",
        "Your IHSS income will be considered part of your household income. \"Disposable income\" is determined by the Means test, which takes into account most income sources and certain deductions/allowances. The Means test can be very complicated. I suggest you consult with a competent bankruptcy attorney to figure out all your options.",
        "Your IHSS income for the six months prior to filing will be counted on the means test as income, yes. Whether or not it is \"disposable income\" depends on your spouse's income, whether your household is over median, and if so, the deductions that can be taken on the means test (possibly including a marital adjustment for your expenses). This is a highly complicated issue, and I would strongly recommend that you and your spouse sit down with one or more local attorneys to discuss all of your options as a couple before one spouse files. Sometimes just one spouse filing makes sense, and sometimes it doesn't - good advice up front could save you a lot of trouble, hassle, and expense later. Best of luck to you."

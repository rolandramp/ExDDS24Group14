    "title": "I am a judgement creditor and am preparing a \"writ of execution\"",
    "question": "I plan to deliver this to the local sheriff who will take it to the judgement debtor's bank. I know the bank and the debtor's account number. However the judgement debtor knows I will be doing this soon. What is to keep them from taking all their money out of the account before the sheriff comes and then putting it back in once the writ has been served.",

        "Other counsel have provided good answers regarding the pitfalls of known attempts to levy assets. I just want to supplement their answers by pointing out you cannot simply fill out a writ of execution and deliver it straight to the county sheriff. You must first submit it to the clerk of court in the court in which the matter was filed along with a check for $25.00 payable to \"Clerk of the Court.\" If the writ is accurate, the clerk will issue it and return it to you in the SASE you provided; it may take weeks for the clerk to issue the writ. Don't forget to file and serve a memo of costs to claim post-judgment costs and interest.\n\nOnce you receive the issued writ, send it not necessarily to your \"local\" sheriff; send it to the county sheriff who presides over the area in which the bank is located. The sheriff probably has a website; look under a category such as \"court services\" or \"service of process.\" You must write the sheriff a letter containing certain information plus levy instructions; the website might provide a fill-in-the blanks form for levy instructions. The sheriff will charge a $30-35 fee.\n\nThe Rutter Group's \"Enforcing Judgments and Debts\" practice guide is very useful for judgment enforcement procedures.\n\nGood luck!",

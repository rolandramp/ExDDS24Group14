    "title": "Suing for repayment of loan under oral contract, but borrower will likely file bankruptcy before case goes to court. What now?",
    "question": "I hired an attorney who started proceedings to collect a debt owed to me under an oral contract. While it is an oral contract, the attorney thinks I have a good case based on evidence I have. The court date is not for several months, but it appears that the person I am suing is going to file bankruptcy. Would this put a stay on my lawsuit? Would I be able to be included as a creditor in the bankruptcy?",
    "answers": [
        "You may continue to pursue your lawsuit as this person may never file for bankruptcy protection. however, Note that If the other party files a chapter 7 BK you will get nothing. Does the attorney fees for pursuing the lawsuit justify the tax deduction you will get from a judgment on which you can not collect? If you know there is a possibility of BK then it seem like you are throwing good money after bad.",
        "If you already have an atty s/he should be answering these questions. If there is no fraud and this is a garden variety BK you are more likely than not to be out of luck and even now wasting your money by throwing good money after bad...",
        "Until the defendant files a petition for bankruptcy protection, carry on with your case. He may never file, and you can't let the possibility of bankruptcy drive your decisions--there's always a possibility of bankruptcy.\n\nHowever, if he does file, your civil action is automatically stayed--stopped in its tracks.\n\nYou can file a proof of claim in the bankruptcy court, and you can seek to have the stay lifted to pursue your civil action, or file an adversary proceeding in the bankruptcy court, if the conditions permit. Consult with your attorney about these details.\n\nAs for the tax deduction, check with your CPA and/or tax attorney.\n\nGood luck."

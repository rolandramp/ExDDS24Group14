    "title": "How can I negotiate down and pay-off my student loan?",
    "question": "I am a 50 year old single female. I have $17,000 student loan since 1989. I have not worked since 1991 and did not file income taxes. I have no more than $5,000 in my bank account, no assets. My credit score is good and my credit cards current. The outstanding student loan is not reported on my credit report. As I moved so many times I started to received letters from collection agencies in the last 4-5 years. There were letters from 3 different agencies. 2 years ago, my neighbor, a lawyer, did me a favor and negotiated a settlement. The collection agency offered a settlement of $25,000 payable in full. I didn't have the money and offer was not pursued. The last collection letter from a different agency was 10 months ago asking for $57,000 including $17,000 in principle, $26,000 in interest, $9,000 in fees. I have not received any more collection letters since then. My mother is going to give me some money as downpayment to buy a small apartment in my name. I am concerned the collection agency will put a lien on my property. Is it possible to negotiate a smaller settlement to put the matter to rest before I buy the apartment?",

        "We are obviously talking about federal loans becuase private loans have statute of limitations which would have long expired. That being said, a debt collector has no power to put a lien on property. The only way that happens is if you are sued, and I can tell you, you are not the type of debtor that would be sued - you have nothing to attach. This is easier than you think. 1) get out of default, consolidation sounds the easiest, and 2) get on a payment plan you can afford, like IBR. That is it. If you need assistance, Google student loan lawyer.",
        "Perhaps you can claim hardship and will never have the ability to pay the loan based upon no employment since 1991. You would have to check with the lender on that procedure, but they may no longer own the debt.\n\nBW",
        "Ignoring your obligations for 23 years can be costly! It sounds like the lender has not been aggressive about pursuing you, but since the loans cannot be discharged in bankruptcy, it does not have to be. How is it that you have not worked for 21 years, you have money in the bank, and you are able to pay your credit cards, but not your student loans? You should attempt to seek a discharge directly from the student loan agency if you are unable to work. Your neighbor already negotiated a settlement for you and you did not accept it. So yes, it is possible, but you have to be in a position to pay the settlement, and you were not the last time."

    "title": "Do I have any legal recourse against a tax preparer who lied on my tax return to get me more money, even though I was not aware?",
    "question": "I now owe the IRS $8500 for two years worth of faulty taxes prepared by a man who supposedly worked for the IRS and told me that he knew of several tax cuts that most people don't. I even told him I didn't save receipts and he told me it didn't matter. He charged me $250 a return, because he was some supposed tax expert. I naively trusted him and signed on the dotted line. The IRS consultant who I spoke with said that it was my fault for signing and trusting him, even though I was completely bamboozled by this criminal. I am a public school employee and on top of my other debts, this is causing me to come very close to financial devastation. I know of 4 others who went to the same man, were told the same thing as I was, were audited, and now owe the IRS thousands.Anything that can be done?",

        "Unfortunately, since you signed the tax return you are responsible for paying the IRS the additional taxes. You may - and I stress \"may\" - be able to qualify for having the penalties waived if you can persuade the IRS that you legitimately relied on your return preparer; however, since you asked about the receipts that demonstrates that you had reason to believe they were necessary so it is very unlikely that you'll be able to get the penalties waived.\n\nYou could try suing the preparer for the damages he caused, but again, you are very unlikely to get anything other than the $250 you paid him, and that's only if he has the money to pay you.

Since the amount you owe is most likely still below $10,000, you have a good chance of getting an installment plan that will allow you to pay the tax off over several years. Keep in mind that penalties and interest will continue to accrue until the taxes are paid in full (the current interest rate on unpaid taxes is 4%).\n\nOther than that, please contact the IRS Office of Professional Responsibility and report this individual to them. It may be cold comfort, but the IRS is very likely to go after him, definitely for very large penalties (which he cannot get rid of) and possibly for a criminal prosecution as well.\n\nGood luck.\n\nwww.newyorktaxcounsel.com"

        "It depends on whether or not all appropriate documents were properly prepared and signed, and which court you filed in. The judgment clerk will reject the judgment package unless all appropriate documents were properly prepared and signed, and at least four Notice of Entry of Judgment forms were included in the package. With properly prepared and signed documents, it typically has taken between 1 week and 2 months for the court to process the documents and enter judgment, depending on the particular court. Because of court personnel cutbacks due to the economy, it could take longer.",
        "A little more information would need to be provided in order to give you proper advisement about this. If the Agreement that the two of you signed was properly executed (notarized and signed by both parties, and also put into the proper format for Judgment or Stipulation), this packet can be sumbitted to the Court for signature as long as Disclosures were also exchanged by both of you. Since your spouse's Default was entered but he signed an Agreement, the Disclosures must be completed by both of you, not just you. One of the things that has to be stated in the Judgment is that you both had knowledge of the other person's assets, debts, income, and expenses. Forms can be completed in order to fulfill this requirement and hopefully this was done already since those forms should be exchanged before an Agreement is signed. You may want to go the Family Law Clinic and show them what you have in order to find out if you need additional forms to be signed and/or exchanged by both of you. Once a Judgment is properly completed and is submitted to the Court, it could take about 5-10 weeks to receive back from the Court. It all depends on how busy the Judgment Clerk is and how soon after the Clerk reviews thew Judgment packet the Judge signs off on the paperwork. If a packet is returned because something essential is missing or improperly done, then extra time will obviously be needed to correct the problem. You really want to be sure that what you submit the first time around is correct in order to avoid undue delay. A family law attorney could look over your documents and perhaps make some suggestions to you about what, if anything, still needs to be done. It may cost you some money to get that advice, but it could be worth it in the end so that you do things correctly. It is so easy for there to be mistakes because there is a lot of detailed language required in Agreements and a lot of forms that are submitted with a Judgment packet and Agreement.",
        "It is not uncommon for your judgment paperwork to be rejected by court staff. Unless you included a large prepaid self-addressed envelope with your paperwork, your papers might be rejected and you will never know.\n\nThe court probably maintains a public pick-up box.

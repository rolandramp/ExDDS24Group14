    "title": "If a Junk Debt Buyer sues a California resident for credit card debt and the card has the 'governing law' clause",
    "question": "from another state - \"No matter where you live, this agreement is governed by the law of the State of...\", say, Virginia (Capital One) - does that mean that the defendant can *not* use CA case law that is not a result of a CC case, but still applicable, in defending the suit since Virginia law has to be applied?",
    "answers": [
        "Absolutely. In fact there are published cases (against Capital One as it happens) stating that. As Mr. Stempler states, VA has a 3 year Statue of Limitations.",
        "If the Choice of Law provision is valid, the California court will apply Virginia Law, with certain exceptions which you can study in your third year of law school.",
        "Yes, VA law would appear to apply. The good news is the plaintiff would have the burden of proof as to what VA law is.",
        "I do not agree. A statute of limitations provision in a local court (say, CA) is not governed by choice of law language in a contract - choice of law refers to substantive legal issues relevant to the contract, not procedural rules/laws in a local forum. Procedural law is almost always local. One exception - CA is known for its \"borrowing statutes\" - something like a SOL from another state if that's where the cause of action arose. Most likely, I'd say the CA SOL would apply here with the court using VA contract rules. Therefore, you'd not be able to use CA case law defending the actual case. You should, however, run the specifics by a local attorney.",
        "It means that Virginia law applies with respect to enforcing that contract. For instance, Virginia's three-year statute of limitations should be applied to the case, such that if they file a debt collection lawsuit on this account after the three year period expired, then the debtor would be able to assert this as an affirmative defense to the lawsuit. It may also be a violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, if the debt is time-barred when the lawsuit was filed or threatened.

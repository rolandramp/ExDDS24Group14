    "title": "How do I add an addendum to our prenup? Does it need the addendum need to be notarized?",
    "question": "My wife and I drafted our own prenup. We are now married and it was pointed out to me that I had forgotten to include some tax debt on the schedule of my debts. I know i can make some kind of addendum, but what should it say and does it need to be notarized? We did get the prenup notarized when we signed it.",
    "answers": [
        "The type of addendum that you need to do is partially based on the language in the prenup that you executed previously as to modification of the prenup. But, in any case, the more thorough the better. And, yes, I would say that you do need to have it notarized again.\n\nMy last thought is that it would have made sense to have an attorney review the final version of your document before you both signed it; however, a bit too late for that.\n\nGood Luck!",
        "Whether you can do an addendum or amendment to your pre-nuptial agreement is determined by the laws of your state and the terms of the existing agreement.\n\nYou should only attempt to amend the existing agreement with the assistance of a lawyer qualified to practice in this area."

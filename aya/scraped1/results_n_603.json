        "Hahahahahaha. No. No you cannot. This is a debt buyer trying to trick you. I'm not even going to hedge my bets on this one. It's important to note that the \"state capitol\" has far, far more important things to do than to call people on 4 year old debts.\n\nThere is a think in California called teh \"statute of limitations.\" The SoL sets up a time limit for a person to bring certain kinds of actions. For a medical debt (and, indeed, all debt except those based on an oral contract) it's 4 years. So the \"creditor\" has 4 years from the last time there was activity on the account to sue you. If they don't, they lose all ability to enforce the debt.\n\nThis company is a debt buyer. They bought a book of old debt from some creditor and are trying to get you to pay them money on something. What we do, as lawyers, is issue the creditor what's called a verbal notice to \"pound sand.\"\n\nDon't pay it. Don't answer questions about it. Don't give them any information about you or it.",
        "The State Capitol would not be contacting you regarding a medical debt. That's ridiculous. If the party claimed they were from the State Capitol, it's a scam. If this is a legitimate claim, have them provide evidence of the claim. Do not make any payments, as this will restart statute of limitations.",
        "You may have a couple things going on.\n\nFirst, If someone is claiming they are from the state capitol and trying to collect a private medical debt then you may have a claim against them and as such I would suggest contacting a consumer lawyer who deals with creditor harassment and debt collection claims.\n\nSecond, if you have this debt and others you cannot afford to pay back then you may want to consider bankruptcy. Bankruptcy wipes away most debt and provides the debtor a fresh start. Also, bankruptcy prevents wage garnishments and bank levies. If this sounds like your situation then I suggest you contact a bankruptcy lawyer. There are many good bankruptcy lawyers here on AVVO."

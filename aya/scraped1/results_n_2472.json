    "question": "my email is ----Lenny-Jive@hush.ai",
    "answers": [
        "yes, if you're unhappy with your carrier switching phone companies before you file Chapter 7 is often a good idea",
        "I agree with the others in a Chapter 7 if you make the payments the cell phone carrier will normally be happy to keep you if you are ready to start over and cancel the contract you can do that as well.",
        "I concur with the advice offered by my colleagues. Either of you can cancel the agreement due to a BK, but cell phone business is very competitive so if you are not delinquent on your bill, the cell company will probably keep you as a customer because all charges incurred AFTER you file BK are post-petition debt and not covered by your BK.",
        "There are always cheaper plans too. Just list your creditor in plan and debt and contract discharged. Then go get a new cheaper pkan!! Good luck.",
        "1) do you want it to be cancelled?\n2) are you current?\n\nif u want it to be cancelled it can be. If you are current, I have never seen a provider cancel the agreement.",
        "Yes, absolutely. Do you mean can you cancel the contract as part of your bankruptcy, or can the carrier cancel it because of the bankruptcy? The answer in both situations is yes."

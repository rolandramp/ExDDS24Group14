        "Employer must comply with valid EWO/garnishment. Collect all documents related to EWO/garnishment. Send to employer with demand to comply. If no compliance, you may sue employer for damages and sanctions. Consider debtor exam to place additional pressure on defendant and to determine current employment and assets. Consider writ of attachment and levy on other accounts. Consult debt collection counsel.",
        "You can also file a judgment debtors exam which will bring in the person you sued into court to exam him for his resources to use for you to obtain your judgment. This is a pretty strong strategic move to use in order to get someone to comply with you. Best of luck.",
        "California law states that an employer can be held liable for failing to withhold wages pursuant to a wage garnishment. Get copies of the paperwork from the sheriff's department proving that they employer received the garnishment order and then file a motion for an order holding the employer liable to you."

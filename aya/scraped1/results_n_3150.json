    "question": "I'm filing a chapter 7 bankruptcy petition. I was involved in a car accident a couple of years ago and settled with the defendant about 6 months ago. After paying my attorney and all medical providers, I have about 25K of that settlement left in my bank account.",

        "Proceed with caution. Yes, under CCP 703, you can protect the cash proceeds up to $26,925; this exemption consists of $1,350 plus any unused portion of the $25,575 homestead or burial plot exemption.\n\nHowever, as mentioned by some of the other attorneys, this will leave other assets potentially unprotected, such as a vehicle with equity more than $5,100 (or any additional vehicles with any equity at all), and could leave any cash in hand or money in other accounts unprotected as well.

        "Agree with colleagues. Yes. CCP 703 \"wildcard\" can be used to exempt and protect amount in bank account. Yes. CCP 703 can be used to exempt personal injury proceeds provided all necessary prerequisites are met. Be careful in analyzing the character of the money left in your bank account to ensure it is traceable to personal injury settlement. Consult BK counsel before committing yourself.",
        "You can use the wildcard, but be VERY careful here. It wont cover all the money if there are other assets that exceed their own category of exemptions. I realize that money may be tight but for like $1500 or less you might not only save yourself some grief and stress attempting to do this yourself but also loss o property. The court records are littered with do it yourself cases that went very wrong for the debtors. Just a week, ago I was contacted by someone who filed their own case in 2011 and at that time he was happy that an attorney friend helped him buy didnt represent him or charge him, he helped alright, sort of. The result is a loss of $10k 3 years later.",
        "The issue of a plaintiff filing BK during or right after a personal injury case is one that many personal injury attorneys face... it's sometimes a result of the injuries... bad injury means no work... no work means no money... no money means debts... debts mean debt collectors... because PI attorneys face this issue somewhat regularly... they usually have a few local BK attorneys that they recommend... the initial poster here stated an attorney was paid... thus, the first place to start in the quest for a BK attorney is that PI attorney for a referral... if that does not work... an Avvo search will likely help... bottom line? no matter how a BK attorney is hired... such a case should have one on board... trying to exempt an injury settlement is not for a pro per or some self proclaimed hot shot document preparer.\n\n- Paul\n\nPaul J.

        "If the $25k is the only asset you have and you do not have a car worth over $5,100 or real property with equity, then you will be able to apply the California state 703 wild card exemption which currently provides just over $26k of protection. Just make sure you speak with an experienced bankruptcy attorney and possible retain one to handle your case for you. There are great, experienced attorneys out there who can represent you throughout your case for relatively low cost and they will make sure no issues come up with the Trustee. It is definitely worth it.",
        "You need to speak with an experienced, local bankruptcy attorney. It seems as though you have done your research, but not using a bankruptcy attorney is extremely risky. Use avvo to find someone with whom you are comfortable. Good luck to you!",
        "I recommend that you speak with a local bankruptcy attorney in person as soon as possible. Personal Injury settlements are exempt up to a certain amount in most states but you can loose this exemption or the \"wild card\" exemption if the funds are commingled with other non-exempt funds. If the personal injury settlement is in a bank account that contains money from other sources it may no longer be exempt.",
        "Wildcard exemption is a Federal exemption of $10,000. This means that you must use Federal exemption all throughout. For example, in the State of New York, we have a homestead exemption of $150,000. If I use the wildcard, I cannot use the NY State exemption of $150,000 but I have to use the Federal homestead exemption amount which is significantly less. Consult a California bankruptcy attorney to discuss your options."

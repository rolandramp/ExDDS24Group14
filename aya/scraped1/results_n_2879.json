    "title": "Should I consider filing bankruptcy for $25k in credit card debt? I have no job and am living off my savings.",
    "question": "I've been unemployed for the past 6 years, and married the last 4 years. We accumulated credit card debt, but paid most of it off during the marriage. Now we are separated, I am still paying off $25k in cc debt, I have no income, but I still have $35k in savings. My husband will not settle our divorce unless I agree to give him $50k, which we used to pay down our cc debt incurred during marriage, plus he wants half the equity increase in my home (owned by me and in my name only since before the marriage). My home is all I have besides what's left of my savings which I need to pay for my living expenses. What are my options?",

As to your spouse's demands to pay $50k, it doesn't seem reasonable as it appears the previous debt was a CP debt and it was paid off by CP funds.

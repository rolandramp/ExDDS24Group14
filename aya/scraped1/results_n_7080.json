    "title": "In California, when does the 10 year clock start for a default judgment start?",
    "question": "Procedurally, in California, when does the initial 10 year clock for a default judgment start? Upon the initial \"Notice Of Entry Of Judgment\" date? Or is it when the case is filed? At some other procedural point?",
    "answers": [
        "The 10 year period starts when the judgment is entered by the court. Notice of Entry may happen at a later date. If the judgment was recorded with the County Recorder, it may cause you trouble even after the end of the 10 year period if you own, buy or refinance a home.",
        "The judgment is enforceable upon entry of judgment. This date is usually the date the judgment is filed with the court (not when notice of entry of judgment is filed with the court, or when the complaint was initially filed).\n\nIn California, an enforceable judgment may be renewed for a period of 10 years if the renewal is filed before expiration of the judgment. ( Code Civ. Proc., §§ 683.120(b), 683.130(a).)\n\nFiling of a renewal application automatically renews the judgment. (Code of Civ. Proc., § 683.150(a).) The period of enforceability of a money judgment expires 10 years after the judgment is entered. (Code Civ. Proc., § 683.020.) If more than 10 years have elapsed since the entry of judgment, the judgment may no longer be renewed. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 683.130.)"

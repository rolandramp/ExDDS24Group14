    "answers": [
        "First you need to review the loan documents some SBA loans require a UCC-1 or financing statement that secured the loan against inventory or accounts receivables. You should have these documents reviewed by an experienced Bankruptcy attorney before filing any kind of Bankruptcy as Chapter 13 has limits on how much debt you can owe and still qualify. Currently the 109(e) limit for unsecured debts is $383,175.00 so if this is an unsecured debt then you won't qualify for Chapter 13 and then you might have to file under Chapter 11 or Chapter 7",
        "Are the SBA loans the only debt that you have? What is the purpose of the Chapter 13? Local competent counsel has to review the total debt picture. Chapter 13 is a tricky animal, so seek the advice of counsel, ASAP.",
        "All three contributors made valid points. One other factor an attorney that reviews this issue must make relates to the value of the collateral if the SBA loans are secured by real property or other property. If the SBA lien is subordinate to other liens and the value of the SBA's collateral is less than the amount owed to the prior lien holder, the SBA claim is still unsecured. If the value of the collateral only exceeds the amount owed to the prior lien holder by the sum of $10,000.00, then the SBA still holds $390,000.00 in unsecured claims and you would still be over the unsecured debt limit.\n\nFinally, all unsecured debt is considered in the analysis, even unsecured priority debt owed to the IRS or other taxing authorities, owed in the form of back child support, or owed to holders of other types of priority claims. Thus, an attorney not only needs to look at the SBA loan documents, he/she needs to have a clear understanding all of your finances before advising you.\n\nOne thing is clear, these issues are complex and an attempt of handle a chapter 13 without the assistance of competent bankruptcy counsel is a mistake.",
        "You would have to look if you put up any assets as security for the loans. If you did not, and the loans are all unsecured, you would be over the Chapter 13 unsecured limit.",
        "You need an attorney to review the loan documents and the specifics of the business history.

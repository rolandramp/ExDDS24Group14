    "question": "If I have a judgment that I forgot about that has not been paid on but has gone over 10 years can I still get it renewed or just out of luck?",
    "answers": [
        "The only slight possible shot could be is IF the ten year anniversary of the entry of the judgment fell between the dates declared by the Governor and / or Chief Justice of California Supreme Court to be the COVID-19 emergency and you were to submit a notice of renewal within the extension period. Off hand I don't know what that is but if you wanted to look into it, you might start there.",
        "After the judgment has lapsed (due to your negligence) there is nothing you can do.",
        "Judgment valid 10 years in California.\nIf 10 years have elapsed without renewal, it has lapsed, you may not renew."

        "Since this is a voluntary lien, you cannot get rid of it in a Chapter 7. Depending on the value of your house, you can probably strip at least a portion if you do a Chapter 13 repayment plan.",
        "Bankruptcy has no provisions to avoid a voluntary lien. To get that money, you would have voluntarily agreed to place the lien on the property. 11 USC 522(f)(1) allows for the avoidance of a judgment lien only.\n\nChapter 13 might allow you to \"strip\" the lien, but only if your property is worth less than the balance of senior liens.\n\nI have no opinion on whether state law might help you with this, so you should talk to a real estate attorney about it.",

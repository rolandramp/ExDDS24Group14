        "There are a few items that a lawyer should know before advising you on your debt situation. First, did you sign the lease or rental agreement or a guarantee form with the landlord? Second, did the landlord or the collection agency file a lawsuit against you or your former roommate? Third, if no lawsuit was filed on this lease, when did you last make a payment on this debt? If they have nothing in writing from you, then you may not owe the debt at all and you should not pay or offer to pay anything. I say may, because it's amazing what documents people forgot they signed.\n\nI have a blog on my \"Don't Pay a Dime Strategy,\" which may apply to your situation. See link below. Essentially, if you don't make any payments for longer than the statute of limitations period, then the debt is no longer your legal obligation, so it is not something to payoff, because in a few more years, it should no longer appear on your credit report. Essentially, federal law permits debts to be reported no longer than 7.5 years from date of delinquency, which is typically the month after you stopped paying it. The major exception is if there is a lawsuit that was previously filed, but has not been fully satisfied, which can be reported until it is satisfied, discharged, or expires. If a debt is disputed, it may be removed from credit reports even earlier if it cannot be verified.\n\nBefore paying anything, I would consult a debt collection DEFENSE attorney. It may not only save you money now, but it may save you from having to pay the rest of this balance. I am concerned that if they get you to pay and acknowledge half of the debt, they could demand you pay the other half or sue you. If you reach a settlement, be sure it is in writing. My Avvo profile has three legal guides on settlement, including terms that you can use to ensure the settlement is properly documented to avoid problems later.\n\nBy: Robert Stempler (please see DISCLAIMER below)\nCONSUMER LAW OFFICE OF ROBERT STEMPLER\nA Professional Law Corporation"

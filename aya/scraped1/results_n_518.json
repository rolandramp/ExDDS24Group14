    "title": "Can A foreclosure co move forward with a foreclosure sale if the mortgage co has put the sale on hold.",
    "question": "I hired a law firm to get my modification, they are telling me that my mortgage co had put a hold on it until they finish reviewing the package. But the problem is the foreclosure co is moving forward with the sale. Can they do that. (Which happens to be tuesday.) or Is this just another lie from my prepaid law firm for a modification? They charged me 3,750.00 and the last email told me to file bk.",
    "answers": [
        "I agree with my colleagues. That attorney's office cannot charge you upfront for a loan modification. Ask for your money back right away and I would speak with an experienced bankruptcy attorney immediately in order to stop the foreclosure sale. The mortgage company will move forward with the foreclosure if the sale date is not officially postponed, even if they say they have a \"hold\" on the sale.",
        "Did they collect the fee in advance? If so they violated the law. You can only collect loan mod fees after the loan mod is complete? Ask for your money back! See a bk atty immediately!",
        "Be very careful here. Until the trustee sale company confirms the sale has been postponed or halted, you should not assume you are safe from foreclosure. You might want to talk to a bankruptcy lawyer ASAP about filing for chapter 13 protection and relief.\n\nBest of luck!",
        "Yes. Foreclosing trustee may proceed with foreclosure even though lender has agree to suspension."

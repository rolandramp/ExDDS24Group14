    "title": "Must Employer excuse you for a Civil Court date?",
    "question": "I have filed for Chapter 7, and my future Court date is pending. I did ask my attorney this question but he was uncertain of the answer. My question is: Once I receive my Court date, upon prior notification must my employer legally excuse my absence for this Court date and without asking what the case if for? My attorney said he thought the answer to this question was \"Yes\". Do any attorneys know for sure? Thank You.",

        "I agree with my colleague Mr. Craig Byrnes. Be on the safe side and ask your attorney for a court order from the judge. The Civil Code does not require your employer to compensate you for the time off. They just may not \"retaliate\" against you. Retaliation by the meaning of employment law has to do with \"adverse employment action\" or something that demeans or is a detriment to your job. The usual manifestations include demotions or termination. Other things can be privileges taken away from you. In other words you cannot be punished for having to go to court so long as it is under the provisions of the Civil Code or other law.\n\nGood luck.",
        "I disagree with the previous responses.\n\nCalifornia Labor Code ยง230(b) provides: \"An employer shall not discharge or in any manner discriminate or retaliate against an employee . . . taking time off to appear in court to comply with a subpoena or other court order as a witness in any judicial proceeding.\" You must give reasonable notice of your need to appear for this provision to apply.\n\nIt is possible that the court has not technically ordered you to appear, although an order usually issues with the provision of the court date. To be on the safe side, consider asking your attorney to explain the matter to the judge and to ask the judge for an order so that your job is protected. I expect most judges would be understanding about this, and would help you out here.\n\nThere is no provision that keeps the employer from asking what the case is for.\n\nI hope this information is helpful to you.\n\nSincerely,\nCraig T. Byrnes\n\nI hope this information is helpful to you.",
        "As a practical matter the Court has ordered you to be present. Tell your employer that.",
        "No law requires your employer to let you go to court for your own case. Jury duty is another story. Your lawyer is likely an excellent bankruptcy lawyer, but one who doesn't practice much (if any) employment law. Just take a vacation day. Don't try taking a sick day because the employer will know you aren't really sick and you could get fired for being dishonest. On the other hand, if your company has Paid Time Off (no distinction between sick and vacation time), then you can just take a PTO day and it won't matter if you are sick or on vacation.",
        "I am not aware of any law requiring an employer to excuse absence from employment to attend court on a personal matter and also unaware of any authority preventing the employer from asking the reason for your absence.",
        "No, your employer has no legal obligation to do this."

    "title": "How is \"disposable\" income calculated? How do you know what is \"voluntary\" retirement when it comes to wage garnishment?",
    "question": "I am a substitute teacher and I had to voluntarily sign up for my retirement plan (teachers don't pay into social security). Since I am a substitute and not a permanent teacher, I was told that I did not need to sign up with CalPERS or CalSTRS if I didn't want to. I now have a wage garnishment but they are not counting my retirement as voluntary, so they are taking more than 25% of my \"disposable income\". How can I show the Franchise Tax Board that they are taking too much. I am having a hard time paying rent because of this garnishment. What counts as \"disposable\"? Everything after taxes? Please help me with this formula.",

        "I am curios on what debt is being collected by the FTB. My analysis of your concerns start with how to stop the garnishment in total, rather than how to reduce it. You may want to consult with a local attorney for some detailed advice.",
        "I suspect you did not file a Claim of Exemption. You can file a motion for payments in installments and the court can reduce the amount being withheld from your wages.",
        "Disposable income is determined by taking your gross income and subtracting all required deductions, such as taxes, health insurance and mandatory retirement, such as PERS & STRS. What you have left over, is your disposable income. If you did not enroll in CalPERS or CalSTRS, then yes, your disposable income would reflect a higher net income. Do you have any deductions for some other type of retirement, such as a 401K? The FTB will not allow you to claim a retirement deduction unless it is actually taken out of each paycheck. You can draft a proposed budget and provide proof of your living expenses to persuade them to reduce the amount they are garnishing. Also, contact the FTB via telephone and try to work out a payment plan that you can afford and are comfortable with. If the debt is significant, you can force the FTB to accept a court ordered plan by filing a Chapter 13 bankruptcy proceeding. However, if you are on limited income, this could be difficult and expensive. Hope this prospective helps."

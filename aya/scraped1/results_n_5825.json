    "title": "Is there a pro bono lawyer to help with my debt and to get my credit rating up from an \"F\"?",
    "question": "When I was in college I paid everything on time. I lost my job, was homeless and everything went down hill. I have been struggling for some years now and my credit has taken a beating even though I pay my big bills on time...doesn't seem to help my score. I am looking to rent and am getting rejected, I tried credit counseling but they told me to get a lawyer. I need help and I do not want to be homeless for a 2nd time.",

        "You may have a bad credit score but I dont think the give \"F\" for credit. You may want to file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy to clear your credit. I find most of my clients end up in the mid 600 range after they file. If you are in the 500 or less then a bankruptcy would improve your credit. Legal counsel has a pro bono project through the bankruptcy court where they will put you in touch with a pro bono lawyer. Check the courts web site for more details.",
        "In Santa Clara County there is the Pro Bono Project. See Link Below.\nAlso Santa Clara University Law School runs a pro bono project. Good place to start.",
        "I agree with Attorney Fenn that bankruptcy may help. Even though it sounds like you may be \"judgment proof\" as far as any creditors trying to collect any judgments from you for non-payment of your debts, a bankruptcy will help clear all of your unsecured debt from your credit report, which often has the effect of improving the credit score. Even though most people feel that filing bankruptcy is a sure way to destroy your credit, that is not always the case if you have a lot of unsecured debt that is dragging your score down. Of course if you don't have much debt and you just have a bad score due to prior issues, then even a bankruptcy might not help. In that situation the only thing that might help is just time. Over time your negative entries on your credit report will begin to drop off. If during that time you work at having a good payment record and your credit does not show any new negative entries being added, then it should improve over time. So, I would suggest meeting with a local bankruptcy attorney (many will offer a free initial consultation), to go over all of your debt and your entire financial situation to see if a bankruptcy could be a good option for you or not.",
        "Have you considered bankruptcy? It can clear up a multitude of debts and credit issues at once. Depending on the complexity of your case, you may be able to find an attorney who will take the case for a low fee. Depending on your income level, you may qualify for fee waivers as well."

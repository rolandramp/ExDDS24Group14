    "question": "I am the sole owner of a company that is in the process of closing and also filing for bankruptcy. I am wondering if in the meantime I can obtain employment with a new company. Is that allowed or will it affect the bankruptcy proceedings in some way?",
    "answers": [
        "yes. Advise your attorney of any significant changes in earnings",
        "Good information provided by my colleagues. Most important is contacting an experienced bankruptcy attorney to discuss in detail the qualification issues related to filing bankruptcy and yes, it must take into consideration your new employment. How are you closing the company? This is another issue that should be discussed in talking with the bankruptcy attorney.",
        "Good question and the answer depends on a few factors. To be clear, no rule or law is in place which disallows you from obtaining new or additional employment if you are filing for bankruptcy protection and relief. However, there may be reasons why new employment causes your bankruptcy case to shift from a chapter 7 to a chapter 13, namely higher income earned. Be certain to have the means test evaluated for new income/new employment along with your bankruptcy budget found in schedules I & J.\n\nBottom line: Talk with your bankruptcy lawyer to be sure your possible new employment will not jeopardize a successful chapter 7 bankruptcy filing and discharge.",
        "It depends upon the employment. The major question your attorney is likely to have is how much are you going to be paid? That, combined with your reasonable expenses, would determine if the job would have an effect on your filing. In other words if you take a job with a net take-home of $4500, and your reasonable expenses are $4450, there will be no problem. If your job pays $10000 take-home with the same expenses, your attorney might recommend a chapter 13. Talk to your attorney, and get an answer based on the specifics of your situation.",
        "You have the right to be earning money to live on for you and any family. Thus, the issue is not can you, you can work. As Attorney Firth stated your income is just one factor as expenses are many also.

But the most important thing is to meet with an attorney as you asking this question means you have not. You care about 2 goals: keeping everything you have equity in and discharging all your debts. If you don't have any of the exceptions to discharge you will obtain that goal; most exceptions are set forth in 11 USC. 523 (Google it) like child support, some income taxes, traffic (in a ch 7) and criminal fines , and presumption of student loans. But some debts are dischargeable in a ch 13 but NOT in a ch 7 so you want to make sure and your attorney will discuss any such types with you also!\n\nYour exemptions depend on what state you have lived in in the last 2 years and thus if in your state, then your states exemptions will apply.

Just one example: If you paid back a relative $3,000 11 months ago and now file bankruptcy next week, the trustee can SUE that relative to retrieve that $3,000 (under what is called a preference) for the benefit of the bankruptcy estate.

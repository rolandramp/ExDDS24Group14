    "title": "I need to write a motion to reopen my chapter 7 bk due to identity theft with EDD.",
    "question": "I have exhausted my appeals with EDD and a portion of the debt was dismissed with my chapter 7 bk. It was discharged in Jan 2011",
    "answers": [
        "If a portion of your debt to EDD was dismissed with your Chapter 7 bankruptcy, then all of the debt due as of the date on which you filed for bankruptcy is wiped out. I think you need to talk with your bankruptcy lawyer to look into the EDD debt and see how it matches up to the amounts due as of when you file for bankruptcy. You may not need to move to reopen your Chapter 7 bankruptcy.",
        "I'm a little confused about this question as well. You say a \"portion\" of the debt was dismissed - meaning? discharged? Or the fraud was confirmed? In other words, if only a portion of it was dismissed and I am unclear on what you mean by dismissed -- that implies that the remainder was ...??? owed by you? What exactly are you trying to achieve by reopening? What do you want the bankruptcy court to do about the identity theft as it relates to the EDD debt? Discharge it as not yours b/c it was the result of ID theft? If so why wasn't it all discharged in the original bankruptcy? I hope my question is not confusing you more.",
        "A bankruptcy can only discharge debts that arise before the date the bankruptcy was filed. If the EDD issues relate to events that occurred after the 2011 filing date, then the 2011 bankruptcy will not help you. Reopening a bankruptcy can allow you to list debts that existed in 2011 but it does not allow you to add debts after the bankruptcy.",
        "I don't understand your question. If you case was discharged , all dischargeable debts are gone as a matter of law. So why are you trying to reopen it ? All debts incurred before you filed are discharged even if you did not know or forgot about them unless they fall within one of the exceptions to the bankruptcy code!"

    "question": "I made a bad decision in 2008 to add a cosigner to a private student loan fraudulently. I was convicted of I'd theft which was recently dismissed.the lender went bankrupt and despite my efforts of trying to set up payment plans, lender says they won't accept payments and have a right to default it. However, it's been 4 Years and they have not defaulted, tried to collect payment, and are reporting it in good standing on credit report. I need to avoid default or lawsuit, however the statute of limitations won't start until they default it? Can a lawyer help me with this?",

        "The normal statute of limitations for contracts applies to private student loans. In California, the SOL is either 4 years or 6 years depending on whether the promissory note is a negotiable instrument. In either case, unless the creditor accelerates the payment schedule based on default, the SOL will run separately on each scheduled payment as it becomes due. Thus, the SOL could be as long as 16 years for the last payment on a 10 year payment schedule. However, as time passes the likelihood of actually being sued goes down significantly. If you can make it 4 years without being sued on the debt, chances are very good that you will not be sued. Chasing the creditor in an attempt to pay this debt will only increase the likelihood that you will be sued.",

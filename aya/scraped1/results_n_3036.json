        "This was investment property that lost money every year? Did you depreciate it [how much]? It might be the recapture tax that is the problem but if it was your home and the debt was forgiven - either in BR or by BOA, you can file a form-982 declaring insolvency. Or include a notice of your BR with your return. Or call the IRS with the info.",
        "Agree generally with colleagues.\n\"debt is forgiven which BofA stated as well I never received a 1099-c however\". Debt forgiveness is taxable income, unless you you negotiated the short sale with bank not to treat as debt forgiveness. Apparently you did not do this. Further, debt forgiveness during period of insolvency is not taxable income. Insolvency presumed if you file BK. Apparently you do not qualify for this favorable treatment. Consult BK and tax counsel.",
        "This is a tax question better handled by a tax professional.",
        "There was an exception to the rule that forgiveness of debt is taxable income but that only applied to personal residences, not investment properties. You may still have some options. Consult with a CPA or Bankruptcy attorney with tax experience.",
        "I concur with my colleagues in that this is primarily a tax question. Consult with an accountant or experienced BK lawyer with a tax specialty. Good luck.",
        "Your realtor did not mislead you. The problem is that when the debt was forgiven by B of A, the IRS regarded that as Cancellation of Debt income. There may be ways to avoid taxation of that debt by using Form 982, but you need to talk to a tax professional for details.",
        "If debt is forgiven, it generally is taxable income, meaning that you have to pay income taxes on the forgiven debt. It sounds like you need to speak to a knowledgeable accountant or tax attorney immediately to sort out the factual issues. Best of luck to you."

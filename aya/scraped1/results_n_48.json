        "The date in the packet is not a trial date. It is the date by which the plaintiff's attorney has to either take the case to trial or dismiss it. Failure to do so will result in sanctions against the Plaintiff's attorney. In my opinion, unscrupulous collection attorneys include that form in the packet they send out in hopes that an unsuspecting defendant like you will think that it is the trial date and nothing has to be done until then. You don't respond to the summons which gives you thirty days to answer, and the the next thing you know there is a default judgment against you. Don't fall for the trap.",
        "A trial date is set and assigned by Court once lawsuit papers are filed. The deadline to consider is that you have 30 days from when you are served to file an answer or other required papers with the Court. You may also be able to file bankruptcy in lieu of filing an answer to stop the lawsuit. Bankruptcy halts most collection lawsuits, eliminates the underlying debt, and can prevent wage garnishments and bank levies. I suggest you consult with a bankruptcy lawyer so you have your options there.",
        "Mr. Firth has provided good information for you. Consulting with an attorney (some of us offer no charge half hour consultations) would be helpful. Also critical to monitor the deadline for filing an answer."

        "Generally speaking, if the severance pay pushes your income above the presumptive amount needed to qualify, you can supplement your bankruptcy filling with a Declaration Rebutting Presumption of Abuse and explain that the severance pay was a one time event and not regular income. As long as you would have qualified before the severance pay, you will qualify afterwards as well. We do this whenever necessary for our clients and have never had a problem with the US Trustee's Office or the Bankruptcy Court.",
        "You have received excellent advice. However, that advice must be applied to your financial situation about which all of us are ignorant.\n\nDo yourself a BIG favor -- once you know your compensation package -- consult with a BK attorney. That way you can receive the advice your situation requires.\n\nIf you are going to be unemployed, perhaps waiting until your compensation package is dissipated is a good choice. Or, perhaps it will be small in the over all scheme of things and an immediate filing is the better choice.",
        "11 U.S.C. 707 allows the US Trustee to dismiss your case or convert it to a Ch 13 if after notice and a hearing, it is determined that your filing a Ch 7 is abusive. The means test is the standardized, systematic, and theoretically “fair” way to determine if a Ch 7 CONSUMER DEBT case is abusive. The means test does not apply in cases where the debtor’s debts are not primarily consumer (household) debts.\n\nAs other attorneys have mentioned, the look-back period for the purposes of the means test is 6 months, beginning the month prior to filing. For example, if you file in September, then your income in August and the five months preceding August is averaged and annualized to determine whether your Ch 7 is presumed to be abusive of the system. The median income for a 1 person household in California is currently $49,188.00 for means test purposes. If you have dependants and/or a household larger than 1 member (yourself), then the median income increases.\n\nAre you very close to the median income, if you take you take your average monthly income over the last 6 months, and multiply that average by 12? Even if you are and the presumption of abuse arises, that still does not necessarily mean that you cannot file a Ch 7, only that more calculations are needed to determine if you are eligible.\n\nIf you can file a Ch 7, you will have to list as an asset on your schedule B that you expect to get severance pay and the amount you expect to get, if known. You will then have to exempt this asset on Schedule C. There are two sets of California exemptions, CCP 703 and CCP 704, and they are both complicated and have limitations as to the maximum property of various types that you can exempt (or keep).\n\nThe bottom line is that the timing of both your BK filing and your receiving the severance pay are important here. It is also important to calculate how close your income is to the point at which the means test would label it abusive.\n\nDo yourself a favor: Hire an attorney!! Their job is to take your stress and bear that burden for you. You pay them to use their education, training and expertise to handle the details and make your life easier. It’s not worth saving some money in the short run in exchange for major hassles in the long run, ranging from having your case thrown out to losing property when the trustee takes it from you when you make mistakes and/or mismanage your case.\n\nHonestly, you could be successful filing on your own, but it’s just not worth the risk.\n\nI wish you luck in your pursuit of justice!\n\nSincerely,\n\nMark Joshua Gordon\nATTORNEY AT LAW\nFORMER VISITING ASSISTANT PROFESSOR OF SOCIOLOGY, LOYOLA MARYMOUNT UNIVERSITY\nLos Angeles, CA\n\n310-817-6817\nwww.resjlaw.com\n\nPLEASE READ THE IMPORTANT NOTICE BELOW!!",
        "Possibly it will affect the means test, because any income received in the 6 months before filing, is reportable.\n\nAs my colleague has said, if you file bankruptcy in the month that you receive it, the proceeds are not reportable.\n\nThere can be calculation of different scenarios, by your attorney, before this even occurs, that may assist you in deciding when to file.\nSuch an increase may be considered for an objection by the US Trustee.\nGood Luck",
        "It also might be a problem on Schedule B. You don't want to have a big lump of money sitting around when you file, as it may not be exempt, and you might not want to have it outstanding either when you file, because it still might possibly be a problem.

        "The \"means test\" requires you to list all income received in the 6 months before you filed. But the trick is to file your bankruptcy before the month ends so you can exclude any sudden \"windfall\" type of income. So if you receive the severance pay on Sept 15, you should file before October 1. If you file September 30, the reporting period is March - August, if you file after October 1, the reporting period is April - Sept.\n\nHope this perspective helps!"

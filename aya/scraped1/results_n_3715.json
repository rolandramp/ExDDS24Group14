    "title": "I took out a 3000 loan with netcredit i cant pay back. how long before they sue?",
    "question": "i took out the loan in OCT. made regular payments unitl Feb. then i hit some hard times and now i havent made a payment in 2 months...missed 5 payments because they take out 186 every 2 weeks ( i was not make aware of this at the time of the loan). i have kept in contact with the company, they just want their money. i can pay this off the beginning of the year but will they wait that long? i was also told by another attorney that if my loan goes into default it will stop all the intrest which is good as far as paying it off but bad for my credit. I just want this done so i can rebuild my credit after i'm done with this. this is the only debt i have left. i currently can't pay due to unforseen personal issues.",

        "You will have to ask netcredit. Their right to sue is clear, but whether they will ever sue is pure speculation. Take a look at all of your debt. Try a legitimate consumer credit counselling agency, one which has been around a while and has a good BBB rating.

        "I doubt that interest will stop accruing. As far as waiting until the beginning of the year, they will need something to agree to wait.

They will want some sort of proof that you will be able to pay.",
        "There is no way to predict how long they will wait before taking legal action. It certainly doesn't hurt to try to reach an agreement with them, but what they will agree to is up to them."

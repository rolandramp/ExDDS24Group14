    "title": "What will happen once defaulted on 3295.00 118% installment loan with check n go?",
    "question": "The loan was taken out in California about 5 months ago. I have been paying 191.13 bi weekly up until this last Friday. I cannot keep paying that amount. I want to work out an arrangement that I can afford but they said they can only refinance me for a larger loan. So, I placed a stop payment for any future ach debits from my checking account. As of a week ago they said I still owe 3000.00 and only 295.00 went towards principle. I know I made a big mistake. I just want to pay off what I owe at what I can afford and not get sued. I went into a store and not online.",

        "If you cannot afford an attorney, try contacting Legal Aid of San Diego (http://www.lassd.org/index.html). They can answer basic bankruptcy questions (I'm not sure if they can help you fill out the forms). As mentioned above, if you have other debts, bankruptcy may be a great option to stop the spiral and get back on track. Most private bankruptcy attorneys will not charge you for an initial consultation.\n\nIf you are unable to pay Check n Go, they will start calling you incessantly. Keep records of every call, including the number listed on caller id, who you talk to, and as much detail about the conversation as you can. They are required to treat you with dignity and respect when making collection calls. If you feel you are being harassed, do not hesitate to contact an attorney from the National Association of Consumer Advocates (NACA.net).",
        "You should talk to a consumer attorney about working out a settlement agreement asap. Many payday lenders do sue for balances in the 2-3000 dollar range so you need to consider that. If you have other debts I would also consult with a local bankruptcy attorney. A fresh start chapter 7 filing may give you the opportunity to get back on your feet. good luck.",
        "Lots of these creditors sue to collect when you become delinquent. But before they sue, they will call incessantly & will drive you crazy. This may be one of those lessons that you will learn the hard way. Hope this perspective helps!"

    "title": "Bank of America could not honor my credit card dispute. Anything I can do?",
    "question": "My vehicle broke down ('90 caddy deville) on the fwy. Took it to a mechanic, the guy said it was a broken starter, fixed it. Then turned around and said it was not the starter, but the engine that cracked. Replaced that with a used one, but the used engine does not work. Another mechanic inspected the work and advisd that 5 out of 8 cylinders are misfiring; In other words, the previous mechanic replaced a broken engine with another broken engine. When I took it back, he at first told me it was covered under warranty, but then turned around and charged me. He forged my signature on two receipts, but BofA still will not honor my claim and they will not give me an answer as to why they will not honor it. Any help is much appreciated.",

    "title": "I have medical debt older than 4 years, how do I get collections off my credit report?",
    "question": "I had a long hospital stay over 4 years ago and disputed all charges through writing letters. I am now past the SOL on this debt and the credit reports still have left these debts on my report after disputing.",

        "Unfortunately, just because they can't sue you for it doesn't mean you don't owe it. For credit reporting purposes, we are talking 7 years here.",

Federal law governs, and says that they may report this for 7 years.\n\nYou can try to dispute the item, and if you get lucky maybe the creditor won't respond and then the item actually will drop off. You have been very lucky so far because they didn't sue you, so maybe your good luck will continue.

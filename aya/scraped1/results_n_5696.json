    "title": "What normally happens after an Abstract Of Judgment is issued, when one has a judgment against them?",
    "question": "After a little over one year, where I got an approximate 14K credit card judgement awarded against me, with no further court activity on my case since January of last year, then on 01/15/2013, an Abstract Of Judgment was just issued (last week). What things might can I expect for the creditor's lawyer to do to me now within the next 30 to 60 days?",
    "answers": [
        "After an Abstract of Judgment is issued, it is then recorded in one or more counties in which you own or MAY own property. If there is equity above the homestead exemption, the judgment creditor MIGHT proceed with a sheriff's sale to sell the real property.\n\nThe judgment creditor can also levy your bank accounts, garnish your wages and take a judgment debtor examination every 120 days.\n\nHowever, there is nothing which the judgment creditor's attorney \"typically\" does or \"must\" do.",
        "The creditor's attorney will record the issued abstract(s) in any county in which you own real property. Recording the abstract creates a lien on any property you own in the country - just like the lien created when a lender records a deed of trust against a property. After recording the abstract usually the attorney will not proceed further because often there are senior liens making foreclosure not worth the time and expense. If any property subject to the lien is sold, and there is equity sufficient to pay the lien (or any part of the lien), then that is when the creditor will receive money."

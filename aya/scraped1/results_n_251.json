        "I believe that the HOA would have been on constructive notice of the bankruptcy case if the mortgage servicer obtained an order lifting the automatic stay for purposes of completing the foreclosure.

        "You can add the debt to your Chapter 13 plan, but talk to a lawyer before doing this. I could not tell from your question if the HOA was listed in your bankruptcy filing. As Mr. Seal mentioned, there could be a stay violation committed by the HOA, This could be used to offset the dues, but this must be litigated in bankruptcy court.",
        "You need to take your bankruptcy information and other information to a lawyer and pay them to analyze it to determine if you have a possible violation of the bankruptcy stay or discharge."

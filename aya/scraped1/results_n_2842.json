        "There is no time limit to file a motion for relief from stay so long as the case is open. Unless there is insurance or a bond to go after, however,a simple breach of contract action is a claim that will be discharged, and therefore the relief is likely to be denied. If there is a third party to go after, then the relief would be limited to that third party (ie: the bond or insurance)\nIf you believe the claim meets one of the definitions for a determinination that the claim is not dischargable you would need to litigate in the bankruptcy court. There IS a timelimit for filing that complaint, and it is usually 60 days after the first meeting of creditors. If you believe your claim falls within the exceptions to discharge, you need to file soon. Talk to competent bankruptcy counsel before filing.",
        "A chapter 7 is federal law and will forgive most debts. Debts incurred through fraud, embezzlement or willful misconduct can survive IF the creditor files papers (called an adversary proceeding) to challenge the discharge of the debt. Those papers are a lawsuit. Depending on what happened, you may want to file an adversary proceeding. A motion for relief from stay might be used if you want to collect from the contractor's bond or insurance.",
        "I think you want to file a motion to lift the automatic stay. This motion can be filed any time while the case is active. However, if you believe your claim should not be discharged, you must file a motion to determine the dischargability of your debt. This motion has a specific deadline date which appears on the notice you got from the court informing you of the existence of the BK filing. BK is not a DIY project. Hire/consult with a lawyer ASAP.

        "You can file it anytime before the case closes. In the scope of things, it may not mater. You have to have a basis for Relief from Stay. Your claim is an unsecured debt that will be discharged in his Chapter 7. The court is not going to grant your requested relief just so you can proceed in Small claims court. If you filed your small claims court complaint after the filing and you do not dismiss it, that may be held as a violation of the automatic stay. Tread lightly and seek the advice of an attorney.",
        "It's not too late. But doesn't sound like you'd have a non discharge able. Speak with an attorney to decide if it's a good to move forward with relief."

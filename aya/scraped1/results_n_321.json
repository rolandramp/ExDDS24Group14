    "title": "Can a storage facility be held accountable to a person who filed chapter 7 for property that was stored in someone else's unit?",
    "question": "We received a bankruptcy notice and the person was not a tenant and never has been. 2 months after our last auction a woman calls and requests the balance on her unit. We state she must have the wrong place and then she informs us that the unit was in her friends name. We told her it had been sold. Now she is suing us for neglecting the automatic stay.",
    "answers": [
        "Sounds like you have strong defenses to the automatic stay violation lawsuit. Be sure to get legal representation particularly if the business entity being sued is a corporation or LLC (cannot appears without legal counsel and requires legal representation).\n\nBest of luck",
        "The debtor's suit sounds very flimsy. You were not a creditor of the debtor, and you did not have notice that the debtor's property was contained in the unit. For a suit for violation of the stay or discharge to be successful, the debtor will need to prove that you knew you were in control of the debtor's property, and you intentionally sold it anyway. You had an objectively reasonable good faith belief that your conduct was not a violation of the stay or discharge order, see Lorenzen v Taggart. Hire an attorney to defend the suit, this sounds like you have a legal defense.",
        "Sounds like you have a pretty good defense. You should consult a with a local bankruptcy attorney for guidance."

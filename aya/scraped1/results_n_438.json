    "answers": [
        "Yes, you should renew the registration as long as the vehicle is in your possession, to avoid being stopped and ticketed. Make sure it is not a better decision to just turn the vehicle in to the lender before the registration is due, to avoid having to pay the registration fee, just a though. Speak with your bankruptcy attorney to determine the best option for you.",
        "Yes, that's a good idea because registering the car will prevent you from getting a ticket for not having the registration sticker on your license plate.\n\nIf the citation is given multiple times, the car can eventually be impounded.",
        "Yes, DMV will be happy to renew registration. Consult your bankruptcy attorney about turning in the vehicle once the petition for BK has been filed."

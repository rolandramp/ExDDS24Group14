    "title": "Can I use credit card payments for alimony?",
    "question": "My ex and I signed an agreement when we divorced & split a credit card debt she solely cashed out on. I agreed to it as I wanted the divorce over with. Currently, I want to transfer my half of 50K to a 0% APR credit card and have asked her to do the same as the interest rate is extreme. Now she's telling me she isn't going to pay anything and I can take her to court. Ultimately it's my credit as she was only an authorized user so I don't want to not pay it. My question is if I can use it as a 24K credit towards any future alimony. She's intitled to alimony for a 27 yo marriage but she has it \"reserved\". I know she'll come for it eventually. I'm not giving her a home, two cars, 100K cash ( HELOC) and still pay 24k and alimony. She signed the settlement agreement but refuses. Help",

        "You really have quite a number of questions with providing a very little factual background. If you obtain a Judgment of dissolution of marriage, and spousal support issue is reserved, depending on the particular language of the Judgment, if that is all it says in regard to spousal support, your ex would have to show new and changed circumstances to get an award for support. As a starting point, you will need a very experienced family law attorney to take a good look, and evaluate, the language contained in your Judgment.",
        "Unfortunately, if she is refusing to pay her portion of the debt, Contempt is not an option available to you, since we don't have debtor's prison for failure to pay debts other than Court-ordered support. If you are forced to pay her portion of the debt to preserve and protect your credit, you can file a Request for Order requiring her to reimburse you, and if she thereafter fails to reimburse you, you can apply for a Writ of Execution to have the Sheriff levy on her wages or bank account. You have no remedy available against a potential future Spousal Support Order. You would best retain an experienced Family Law Attorney to represent you.",
        "Well, since there is no \"alimony\" there is no need to pay it with a credit card. On the other hand, if there is a court order to pay or transfer out her 50% of the credit card, then you can take her back into court for contempt, failure to obey a lawful court order. A lot hangs on the way the judgement was written. i would suggest that you take your judgement to a qualified family law attorney to help you to interpret the judgment and to discuss with you any possibilities that might be available to you. Good luck!"

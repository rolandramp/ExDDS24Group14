    "title": "How does a bankruptcy trustee price a property for sale?",
    "question": "When a California bankruptcy trustee attempts to sell a property to pay creditors, does it go to auction and normally sold at below market value? or is it sold through a real estate agent to the general public at full market price? What is the commission that a trustee gets paid from the sale?",
    "answers": [
        "Mr. Shields and Mr. Michel are correct in how the Bankruptcy Trustee will employ a real estate professional to complete the sale. Because it is within the bankruptcy, the Trustee and the real estate professional may end up selling for less than the maximum value the house could be sold for ordinarily.",
        "The bankruptcy trustee will hire a real estate broker but the property will generally get a lower price compared to if it was not being sold out of a bankruptcy estate.\n\nThe real estate broker will earn a commission subject to prevailing rates and it must be approved by the court, the same way the bills from the trustee's attorneys and accountants must be approved.\n\nThe trustee earns a commission from paying creditors.",
        "This is not a foreclosure question. The Bankruptcy court Trustee is not foreclosuring on your property, but reather selling it. Trustee will employ real estate profession to value the property and to sell it.",
        "A foreclosure sale is an auction. Quite often the property will sell for substantially less than fair market value, but that is because the market value for a foreclosure is less. There could be issues with the condition of the property, with legal challenges, with holdover tenants, etc. So the property will almost certainly sell for less than it would if sold by a realtor in an ordinary sale. Often the lender is looking to recoup their loan balance, or has decided on a number which it would accept less than that.",
        "When you borrowed the money, you likely signed a \"deed of trust\" and conveyed a property interest to a designated trustee. You also agreed to a \"power of sale\" clause which empowers the trustee to conduct a public auction pursuant to the California non-judicial foreclosure statutes. The purpose of the auction is extract the money you owe from the collateral (house) by selling it to the highest bidder. The purpose is not to obtain the highest price; investors attend these auctions to obtain bargains. Remember, you agreed to this process when you borrowed the money.\n\nNo realtors are involved. The trustee will conduct a public auction where the opening bid (\"credit bid\") is made by the debt owner usually for the full amount of the debt. Investors may out bid the debt owner's credit bid and the highest bid wins a clear title to your home (trustee's deed). Junior liens get paid from excess proceeds above the credit bid. You may still be liable for unpaid portions of the junior liens (unsecured debt). You may receive surplus proceeds if the final bid is high enough.\n\nThe winner of the trustee deed also wins the right to possess your home. The new owner is free to serve you with a 3 Day Notice to Quit (leave). Bonafide tenants typically have enhanced rights. But if you don't leave in 3 days, the new owner can file an eviction lawsuit (unlawful detainer) to force your removal by the sheriff. The new owner may try to reach a settlement with you first or not.\n\nTo delay the foreclosure and\\or eviction process, or possibly save your home, consult or retain a qualified attorney ASAP. Representing yourself is never wise, especially in foreclosure matters. Seek professional help or expect a worse outcome.",
        "This is something that will require representation by the right type of attorney, there will may be other options open to you. Only a CA mortgage foreclosure defense and bankruptcy attorney has the expertise to prevent you from having more problems than you can possibly imagine.

    "title": "Will Kaiser Insurance drop you if you discharge your debt to them through bankruptcy?",
    "question": "I am currently in the middle of a chapter 13 bankruptcy plan. Last week my child had to have emergency surgery which resulted in a $3000 bill. My lawer says I can modify my bankruptcy plan to add the hospital bill. If I do can Kaiser drop my family's coverage? It is a plan through my employer.",

        "Ms. Larkin's answer is the one you should follow because, despite the uniform law of bankruptcy, it is practiced differently in every jurisdiction. All I want to add is that courts typically require you to increase your plan payment to cover the additional debt. Also, one reason the creditor would agree to be paid this way is that post-petition income is an asset of the estate because it is needed to make the plan work.",
        "I will disagree with the above response. There are certain circumstances under which a post-petition debt can be added to an existing Chapter 13 bankruptcy.

        "FIrst, if you are in the middle of your Chapter 13 plan, and your child's hospital treatment was just last week, the hospital bill is a post petition debt that is not subject to your chapter 13 discharge. So if your lawyer meant that the debt could be discharged without payment by modifying your Chapter 13 plan, that is not correct. If your lawyer meant that you could try to modify the Chapter 13 plan to lower the plan payment to free up money to pay the hospital bill, that is somthing the bakruptcy court could approve. But if the hospital bill is paid there would be no reason to drop you from coverage. Even if your portion of the hospital bill is not paid, this should not affect Kaiser's decision to continue to provide coverage; i.e., whether or not the hospital gets paid does not affect Kaiser's bottom line. What does affect Kaiser's bottom line is paying on claims, so unfortunatley, any claims such as your child's emergency surgery may cause an increase in rates and even dropping you from coverage."

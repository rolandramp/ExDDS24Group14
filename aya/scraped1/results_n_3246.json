You may want to consult with an attorney who can explain things to your satisfaction, but hiring your own defense counsel in a situation like this is probably a waste of money.

If she has substantial non-exempt assets (for example, if she has a net worth of several hundred thousand dollars exclusive of retirement accounts) then she needs to look at how to manage this potential liability. That may include retaining defense counsel or consulting with a bankruptcy lawyer.

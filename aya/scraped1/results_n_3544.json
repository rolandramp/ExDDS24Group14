    "title": "Can a creditor put a lien on your home and garnish your wages at the same time?",
    "question": "I fell behind on credit card debts and now the creditor put a lien on my property. Then I received notice that my wages will be garnished from the same creditor. Can a creditor do both simultaneously? Once the debt has been cleared, what actions do I need to do to remove the lien from my property?",
    "answers": [
        "Your wages can be garnished, your bank account levied upon, and your home and car liened up, all at the same time. Once the debt is paid in full, the creditor is required to release any liens.",
        "Yes. A creditor with a judgment can simultaneously use all allowed collection methods.",
        "Yes. And, until the debt is paid, they can also levy your bank account, and levy on other property. As to the lien on your home, they should file an Acknowledgement of Satisfaction of Judgment, and you should record a certified copy thereof."

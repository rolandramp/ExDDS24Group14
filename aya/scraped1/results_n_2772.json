        "Once the lender sells the property at a foreclosure sale, title reverts to the lender. At that point, the legal owner of the property becomes the lender, and title to the property passes to the lender, The owners of the property cannot file a Chapter 13 petition, or even file an adversary proceeding in an existing Chapter 13 case to reclaim the home, because there is no ownership interest for the bankruptcy court to protect. This is a different situation than a repossession of an automobile, which can be reclaimed from the creditor in a Chapter 13 case. You have lost your home for good, unfortunately. Bankruptcy filings are not DIY projects.",

        "As stated by my colleague since you had more than 2 prior bankruptcies within the year there was no automatic stay without a specific judicial order. The lender had every right to continue with the foreclosure. At this point you can look into a chapter 7 to discharge any remaining debts you have if you have not filed within 8 years.

        "Unfortunately, if you have more than 2 prior cases within one year of the present case, there is no automatic stay until you file a motion to impose the stay.

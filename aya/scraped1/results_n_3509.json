    "title": "Is defaulting on a payday installment loan in CA fraud? Can they file criminal charges?",
    "question": "I defaulted on an installment pay-day loan. I have recently started receiving calls from a 855-326-2577, 855-465-4128 Both claiming to be two different attorney's offices, stating they were going to file criminal charges against me and that they had an affidavit. When I asked if they could provide me with their location they refused to do so and told me they would see me in court and hung up. I don't know what to do? I called the county DA's office as well as the court and there is no record for my county. Also when I look up the number online it appears to be a scam. Advice please!!! Can they do this in the state of California??",

        "They are probably not a scam because your debt information was likely sent to them by your pay-day loan company, but they likely are a nasty and unscrupulous collection agency that is not run by an attorney. It might be a good idea to contact your pay-day loan company directly and see if you can workout a resolution.",
        "No criminal charges will not happen for a breach of contract, and both callers have violated the Fair Debt Collections Practices Act. Further, if the callers were really attorneys, then they could easily be disbarred for threatening criminal prosecution to obtain advantage in a civil case. Finally, pay me or I will go to the police can be construed as criminal extortion.",
        "To really know if you have legal recourse, you need to first identify who these people are. It sounds like a scam to me, rather than a legit collection agency. Take one of the nasty calls and ask them what address to send the check to. If they are scammers, they will want some non-check type of payment and will refuse to identify their company. If it is a scam, best to report it to the police and change your numbers, as there is not much else you can do. However, if you can identify a real collection agency, then do contact a consumer attorney who specializes in FDCPA claims, as you can likely get representation on a contingent fee, and you only have one year to sue.",
        "The conduct you describe violates both the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and the Rosenthal Act (California's version of the FDCPA). These laws regulate the manner in which debt collectors may attempt to collect debts, including what collectors may and may not say to debtors. If the collectors threatened criminal charges, they violated the provision prohibiting a collector from representing or implying that nonpayment of a debt will result in an arrest. If the collectors are making such bold statements, they may also be violating other provisions of the FDCPA and Rosenthal Act (as well as other consumer protection statutes).\n\nYou should strongly consider contacting an attorney to discuss your options, which may include pursuing a claim against the collector(s) for violations of the FDCPA and Rosenthal Act.\n\nIn the interim, be sure to keep records of all calls (date / time / number called / number called from / who you spoke with / details of the conversation). Also, keep copies of any letters to or from the collection agency.",
        "Only a public prosecutor can file criminal charges against someone. You may want to report this misconduct to the State Bar of California if an attorney is actually involved, or to file a complaint with the State division that regulates the collection agency business. Hope this perspective helps!"

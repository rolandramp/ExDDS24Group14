    "title": "I am filing bankruptcy in CA. My only concern is the duplex that I live in with 2co-signers (3 people on the loan).",
    "question": "Duplex has 125,000 in equity. We have lived there for 4 yrs. Will the trustee split equity in 3?since I'm filing for bankruptcy, but not consigners. Will all the $125,000 be exempt under CA exemptions, or at least my portion?should we all file homestead? How likely is it that trustee will sale the home to pay for my credit card debt?",
    "answers": [
        "As the other answer pointed out, who is on the loan is irrelevant. It's who's on title that matters, as well as (possibly) how title is held (joint tenants vs. tenants-in-common, etc.).\n\nYour homestead exemption will apply to your portion of the ownership, so if it is owned evenly in thirds, your portion would be worth (under the facts you've given) $41,667, and that is the amount you would theoretically need to exempt.\n\nI am in Los Angeles, so feel free to contact me for further consultation on this matter.",
        "The real issue is not who is on the loan, but who owns the property. The trustee can only liquidate property that belongs to you, so it sounds like that would be 1/3 of the equity in the duplex. Whether or not you can exempt that equity along with everything else that you own depends on your entire financial picture. It would certainly be worth it for you to consult with one or more local, knowledgeable attorneys to get an idea of that complete picture, or you could risk assets being sold.",
        "Since you only own a one-third interest in the property, only one-third of equity or $41,667 is yours. If you are residing in the property at the time of the filing of the bankruptcy, you will be able to claim a homestead exemption and protect the property.",
        "I agree with colleagues. You are entitled to homestead exemption based on these facts. Depending on how title is held, you may be entitled to one-third of equity. Colleagues have accurately described trustee analysis. Consult BK counsel.",
        "Here is how the Trustee will look at that property: Figure out fair market value, then subtract 8% as a cost of sale. From the balance, subtract away any mortgages on the property. The balance is the equity in the property. Divide that number by three to reflect your portion of the equity. Subtract away any homestead exemption available to you (using either Sec 703 or 704 of the California Code of Civil Procedure) and if the balance of your equity is over the homestead exemption, you owe the Trustee. You will need a bankruptcy lawyer to determine which exemption is the better deal for you and then to negotiate with the bankruptcy trustee if you are over the exemption.",
        "I agree with all of the prior answers. I wanted to add that if you are on title with 1/3 interest the trustee could force sale and/or offer a buy out option to the other owners. If these are the issues you are dealing with you should certainly seek an attorneys help. It will be worth the money.",
        "I totally agree with Mr. Waddell and hope you will see a local bankruptcy atty: Go to AVVO.com, find a lawyer and put in the specialty area and your geographic location and attorneys should pop up. You can call a few and see about prices and availability."

    "title": "Is he responsible for the debt?",
    "question": "In 2006 we had a chapter 11 bankruptcy. Everything was discharged approx 2 yrs later. A lot of the debt was student loans originally through Sallie Mae but taken over by Navient. In 2015 Navient has been coming after the cosigner to pay up AFTER the discharge which he has been paying until we told him he shouldn't have to be paying that. He stopped paying for the last few months and now it is affecting his credit. Is he still responsible for the debt or is Navient using fraudulent collection tactics?",

        "I agree with the other answers about the discharge of student loans. I would add that even if you filed an adversary proceeding and the student loans were discharged for you, the loans were not discharged for the co-debtor. A bankruptcy filed under any chapter can only discharge the debt for the bankruptcy debtor.\n\nThus, the co-debtor is still liable for the student loans whether you discharged your obligation or not.",
        "You probably filed a Chapter 13, not a Chapter 11, since a Chapter 11 is corporate reorganization. Student loans are not dischargable unless you literally have one foot in the grave and the other slipping into the grave. Even if the debt was dischargeable for you, the co-signer would still be liable. To properly answer your questions and address your concerns, the best way to handle this is with an in person consultation with an experienced CA bankruptcy attorney. Use AVVO's Find a Lawyer tool to select a qualified attorney. Good luck. THIS IS NOT LEGAL ADVICE! YOU NEED TO SPEAK TO AN ATTORNEY WHO IS LICENSED IN YOUR STATE FOR LEGAL ADVICE. This is merely suggestions for you to think about in discussing your situation with the local attorney.",
        "Student loans are not dischargeable unless you specifically file an Adversary Proceeding (\"AP\") to have a judge determine the loans are discharged in your bankruptcy. Even if you file an AP it does not mean the judge will agree. It's difficult, not impossible, but difficult to discharge student loans. If you fail to pay, it will be reported negatively on your credit.\n\nYou may want to get the loans in \"rehab\" immediately to get the negative reporting off the credit reports. In addition, you may want to meet with a student loan attorney to check out other options. Student loans are a serious debt crisis in the U.S. today. Best of luck."

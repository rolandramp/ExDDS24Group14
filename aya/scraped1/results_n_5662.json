        "This question is a bit confusing because the creditor usually should be filing the satisfaction of judgement. Nevertheless, call the main number on the court's website and have your case number handy. They will be able to direct you to the right department.",
        "It should be filed at the courthouse where the judgment was entered. (The caption of the document you have--i.e., look at the top half--should have the name of the court branch/location.)",
        "Look at the case number on the document. The Satisfaction of Judgment should be filed in the court where the judgment was entered. If the judgment was entered in Los Angeles County, go the the court's website and input the case number.

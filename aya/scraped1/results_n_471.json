        "Everything is examined very closely, and they won't take your word for anything that is important.\n\nObviously from your question it is apparent that you are worried about keeping your property and worried that your income might exclude you from Chapter 7.\n\nYou will benefit from having a personal meeting with a certified bankruptcy specialist. It is rare, but sometimes the best service a lawyer can provide is to provide someone with the reasons why they should not file Ch 7.",
        "The statements could be accepted at face value if no one objects. I suggest that you attend the creditors' meeting and express your concerns to the trustee. That is your time t examine the debtor who will be under oath subject to the law or perjury. If you have any proof to support your suspicions, you should provide that to the trustee even if you can't attend the hearing.",
        "It appears that this is a duplicate question that was posed earlier.\n\nThe Debtor is required to turn over basic documentation to the trustee as part of the administration of the bankruptcy case. If the trustee has additional questions or concerns, the trustee may request additional documentation from the Debtor to substantiate the information that is listed in the bankruptcy petition (which the Debtor lists under penalty of perjury). If you believe the Debtor is concealing assets, undervaluing property or misstating information on the bankruptcy schedules, you should seek out and retain competent counsel to assist you with your position and ensure that you do not miss out on a potential distribution (if any is warranted).",
        "As a creditor, you have the right to attend the meeting of creditors and ask the debtor questions regarding the schedules. However, if you have evidence that the valuations are incorrect, write the Chapter 7 Trustee a letter (clearly identifying the case) with your evidence. The Chapter 7 Trustee is interested in adding value to the non-exempt estate. If your evidence establishes different facts than those declared in the Petition and supporting schedules, the Chapter 7 Trustee will be interested. You also have the right to file a timely adversary proceeding if the facts warrant it."

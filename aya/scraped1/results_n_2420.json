    "title": "Access to a mini storage unit of a recently deceased man by his only child, my foster child.",
    "question": "My foster child's father passed away without leaving a will or any instructions on what to do with his things, which included a mini storage locker. The management of the facility said that just a death certificate would not be enough but would not provide me with a list of what else would meet their requirements. Their excuse was that in the past when they offered advise, it came back to bite them when someone else legally entitled to the unit showed up.",
    "answers": [
        "It is always best to see an attorney but despite the risks noted above you will probably be fine filing a small estate affidavit, assuming the estate is small.",
        "I am sorry your foster child has to experience the death of his father. I hope he is okay. As far as access to the storage facility is concerned. I understand the storage facility's position. Unfortunately, without knowing more details, it's impossible to determine how your foster child can get access to the mini storage locker. While there is a simplified probate proceedings for estates with a value of no more than $150,000, the downside is that the heirs will be personally liable for the decedent debts. I am assuming that your foster child is still a minor, which means the child cannot proceed without a guardian ad litem and the guardian ad litem would in turn need an attorney. The affidavit procedure also requires the signature of all heirs. You did not mention whether your foster child was the only child and whether his/her father was married or had any other next of kin (i.e., parents or siblings). You really should consult with a probate attorney who can advise you based on a review of all the relevant facts. Best of luck to you and your foster child.",
        "The storage facility has a duty to protect the belongings of the decedent and to release them only to a legal appointee of the estate as its administrator. Someone from the family needs to either get a small estate affidavit approved or to be appointed by a probate court as the administrator with Letters of Administration.",
        "I agree with my Avvo colleague. As the facility if it has such a form for you to complete and use.",
        "You need something called a Small Estate Affidavit under Probate Code section 13100. It is short and easy to prepare. After 40 days from the death it can be filled out and you attach the death certificate to it. If his \"probate\" estate was less than a $150,000 in personal property and no real estate this will work. Otherwise you can't use it and you'll need a probate attorney to advise you."

    "answers": [
        "Contact a local bankruptcy attorney who may be able to look up your case status on the courts website.",
        "Yes, it sounds like you have a date for the Meeting of Creditors but failed to file certain necessary schedules or statements and the court dismissed your case 14 days after the filing date.",
        "If your case was dismissed then your 341(a) meeting will not go forward, if that is the hearing you are referring to. The dismissal will say why your case was dismissed as Mr. Steingraber points out. Usually a bankruptcy is dismissed within 14 days if not all of the required documents are filed with the Court. If you are going to re-file I highly recommend consulting with some experienced bankruptcy attorneys and hiring one to represent you to get it done right the first time.",
        "Among other things, it means you did not use an attorney. That said, the notice will often say why the case was dismissed. Was it a 13 or a 7?"

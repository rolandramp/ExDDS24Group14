    "title": "Is a \"stipulation for entry of judgment pending performance and for court to dismiss without prejudice\" a judgment?",
    "question": "I have settled with zwicker on a credit card debt, to make payments until paid. They have told me they won't place a judgment on me as long as I make my payments on time. However, the agreement doesn't specifically say they won't place one on me. Should I ask them to include certain verbiage to this effect in the agreement? I live in california. Thanks",

        "If you can get any verbiage added that makes you feel more comfortable then that is good. However, a \"stipulation for entry of judgment\" generally means that you agree they can enter a judgment and \"pending performance' would probably refer to your performance and \"dismiss without prejudice\" means that the lawsuit is going to be dismissed and since it would be without prejudice, they could refile again at a later date. Each term in the stipulation is important and that is what lawyers do.\n\nReading the phrase at a whole and without seeing the actual language, it looks like what you would have is an agreement that they could enter a judgment against you if you don't make whatever payments that you promised. If you don't make they payments, they can just get a judgment. But since the payments are going to take time to make, they are dismissing the lawsuit. So, if you don't make the payments on time, they can refile a new lawsuit and get a judgment. Isn't that alot for just 14 words. Remember, I am just looking at a title and not the contract or stip.",
        "When there is a written stipulation, any oral assurances, representations and promises are of no effect. The Stipulation should specifically state that if you pay as agreed, the case will be dismissed. (Sometimes the case is dismissed w/o prejudice at the time when the Stip is filed, with the court reserving jurisdiction. You should specify that you get notice of any alleged default, and, perhaps, time to cure in the event that your payment is not received. (The post office might lose something sent by mail.) And you may want to include provisions relating to credit reporting. In addition, are they going to send you an IRS Form 1099-C, which will require that you report and pay tax on any portion of the debt that is forgiven? I think that you should pay for a 1/2 hour or 1 hour consultation with a lawyer to review the Stip before you sign it.",
        "A agree with the other attorneys. Normally a Stipulation for Entry of Judgment contains language that the Judgment will not be entered unless the defendant defaults on the agreed to settlement. Again, normally, the underlying lawsuit is dismissed without prejudice. That means the case can be filed again. However, there may be language in the stipulation that allows for a Judgment to be entered upon default without notice to you. You should have the document reviewed by an attorney for a full and complete explanation before you sign it. I have negotiated many settlements with Zwicker.

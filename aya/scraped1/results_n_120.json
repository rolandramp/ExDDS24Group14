    "title": "Filed chapter 7 bankruptcy & did NOT assume on my auto lease. When I turn it in, can they charge me for mileage/condition?",
    "question": "*to be clear - I stated in my bankruptcy petition that I intended to assume the lease, but when they sent me paperwork to do so I did not fill it out or sign it. I've just kept on paying the payment and driving the car*",
    "answers": [
        "They get the car “as is” and you walk away with no further liability",
        "See my prior answer and including the comment in it. Thanks for asking.",
        "It sounds as if your BK papers stated that you were going to assume the lease (Statement of Intention). There's a new case on this which holds that this assumption means the debt survives the discharge, even if you did not sign the reaffirmation papers. Bobka v. Toyota Motor Finance (August 2020)\n\nThey could seize the car, and you'd still be stuck with the debt. So, you should seek some accommodation from them, and perhaps keep the vehicle well out of sight until the agreement is written down.\n\nGOOD LUCK!!"

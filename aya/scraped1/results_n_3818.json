    "title": "If I received a \"Request to Enter Default\" FL-165 is my divorce going to be finalized without my agreement? How can I respond?",
    "question": "My domestic partner of 9.3years filed for dissolution and since then she hasn't been 100% honest on the paperwork. She had a verbal agreement with my parents for a loan of $10,000 that was split between the both of us. She has since decided she doesn't need to pay for the loan and while discussing this matter, I haven't signed the divorce paperwork stating there are no outstanding debts. Last week I received this FL-165 paperwork and now I'm worried that she's going to be granted a divorce without my agreement or signing of any paperwork. She also asked to not have to pay alimony after I quit my job to go back to school and then she decided to walk out on me. What can I do to ensure I receive the proper benefits and repayments of loans?",

        "Go to occourts.org NOW and fill out the Response and a Proof of Service forms. (someone other than you have to swear they mailed her a copy). Then take them to the courthouse at 341 The City Drive, Orange and pay the filing fee and have it entered. There is a good chance that the Request to Enter Default will be rejected and you can get the Response filed. Once it's filed you are in the case and you will be entitled to notice of hearings etc. If her Request to Enter Default has been entered, you no longer have a say in the case unless you try to set it aside. Most judges will grant a Motion to Set Aside Default this early in the case. Set an appointment to have a REQUEST FOR ORDER Motion to Set Aside Default Motion. As part of that Motion, parties have to try to resolve issues (Meet and Confer) in that Meet and Confer you may request that she sign a Stipulation to set the default aside and see if she will. If you continue to do nothing, you will have nothing to say in the dissolution.",
        "You should ready consult with a Family Law attorney to protect your rights and I would do it quickly.",
        "Were you properly served and just failed to respond?\n\nShe does not have to have your agreement or signature if you are in default. She should have filed at least preliminary disclosures.\n\nMy colleagues have given good advice. The longer you wait the more difficult it will be.",
        "You either need to enter into with your partner and file a Stipulation setting aside your default, or if your partner is unwilling to do so, you need to file a Motion to Set Aside your Default, accompanied by your proposed Response to the Divorce Petition. If you can afford an attorney, you would best retain an experienced Family Law Attorney to advise and represent you. If you can't afford an attorney, you should promptly go to your Superior Court's Self-Help Clinic for assistance from a volunteer lawyer. You have no time to lose - move quickly, or you will be unable to participate in your divorce.",
        "hire a lawyer to set aside the default and evaluate the issues asserting your best arguments regarding support and division of assets."

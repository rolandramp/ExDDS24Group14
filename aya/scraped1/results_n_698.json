    "title": "If I file bankruptcy after being sued for debt can they still collect?",
    "question": "I have recently received a letter for collection from a law group representing credit card debt collector but have not yet been sued. If they do sue and then I file bankruptcy after the suit process begins, what happens to the lawsuit? Can they still collect? Is the lawsuit still valid? Do I have to attend to both the collection suit and the bankruptcy case at the same time? And how long / how quickly can I complete bankruptcy (I pass the means test for Chapter 7)",
    "answers": [
        "A bankruptcy filing protects you from the pending lawsuit via the automatic stay which is created upon filing your bankruptcy case. The automatic stay prohibits creditors from pursuing collections against you, which also includes lawsuits filed.\n\nBankruptcy case preparation and timing before filing depends on who you work with to help you and how quickly you are able to provide required information and complete the credit counseling course. Most law firms can expedite a filing one way or another if you need a case filed ASAP.\n\nBest of luck",
        "In your jurisdiction may be an order to administratively close the case due to the stay. Alough creditors may motion to reopen the case, if your bankruptcy is completed leading up to discharge, such a motion would be in violation of the discharge injuntion.",
        "You can take the means test online, so the timing of that shouldn’t be an issue. I will change your question to bankruptcy and debt.",
        "A bankruptcy filing will \"stay\" (freeze) the collection lawsuit until the BK is completed, at which time the claim should be dismissed. As far as how long the BK will take, you should consult a BK attorney who can review the specifics of your situation."

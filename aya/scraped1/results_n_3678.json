        "Mortgage lenders are always trying to talk people into signing reaffirmation agreements because they know that creates personal liability all over again for a debt that was discharged in your bankruptcy. Reaffirming a mortgage is usually a very bad idea, and reopening your bankruptcy case after four years - probably an even worse idea. You can try reporting your own payment history to the credit bureaus - my legal guide explains this here: https://www.avvo.com/legal-guides/ugc/shouldn-t-i-have-signed-a-reaffirmation-agreement-during-my-chapter-7-bankruptcy-. FHA rules allow people to apply for a new FHA mortgage TWO YEARS after bankruptcy assuming steady income and good credit.",
        "In addition to what you now already know from the prior answers, I believe in fact you CANNOT REOPEN A CASE TO FILE A REAFFIRMATION EVEN IF YOU WANTED TO AS THE LAW REQUIRES IT TO BE FILED BY THE DISCHARGE DATE AND YOU ALREADY RECEIVED IT!. I would focus on what is needed to increase your credit score such as 2 new credit cards also in addition to reporting those payments as explained already by the other attorneys! Good luck.",
        "You may not be able to get Wells Fargo to cooperate, but you can get your comments into your credit report as explained by another attorney that answered your question. However, you might be able to do so by sending a letter to Wells Fargo requesting that it start sending monthly statements to you and reporting your payments to the credit bureaus.\nIn California, a person who obtains a loan to purchase a single family residence does not owe the lender if he defaults and the property is lost to foreclosure (California's Anti-Deficiency Law set forth in California Code of Civil Procedure Section 580d). Therefore, reaffirmation of a California purchase money home loan accomplishes nothing other than allowing Wells Fargo and similar lenders the comfort of not violating the discharge injunction by sending statements to borrowers and reporting the status of payments on borrowers' credit reports. By sending a letter requesting that Wells Fargo take these actions, you are providing similar protection to Wells Fargo.\nDon't believe the statement that you will not be able to acquire a new home loan without reaffirming a prior home loan, that is simply not true.\nBankruptcy Judges will not vacate a Chapter 7 discharge for the purpose of entering a reaffirmation agreement, as correctly stated by other attorneys answering your questions.",
        "You are being misled by those who claim only a reaffirmation can fix your dilemna. Here's what to do:\n1. You will receive an annual report of your mortgage payments showing the allocation between principal and interest, taxes and insurance; you can show this to anyone asking for your mortgage payment history; 2. Contact each of your 3 national credit reporting agencies and dispute any and all negative mortgage reports; each agency will have to verify the information being reported as accurate; 3. Dispute the mortgage report again demanding written verification to verify the accuracy of the report; 4. Demand each agency include your \"consumer statement\" in which you can tell \"your side of the story\". This statement will become part of your report and will appear on your report so anyone will have it as part of your report.\n\nDo not, repeat do not reopen your closed bankruptcy case and file a reaffirmation agreement. Any lawyer who tells you to do so exposes him/her self to liability for malpractice.",
        "Wells Fargo is not your attorney so please don't take advice from them. They have their interests in mind... not yours. The best part of filing bankruptcy is that the loan was discharged. You don't know what the future will bring. Someone could get sick or lose a job. You would have the option of letting the mortgage company foreclose and not be liable for the deficiency. That is more important than whether your payments were reported to the credit reporting agencies. You can report your payments yourself. You say that \"I am being told without the reaffirmation I will not get a new mortgage for 5 years...\" Who told you that? Not true."

        "Can the heirs afford to pay the mortgage even if they can't qualify for a loan? If so, there is a federal law (called the \"Garns-St. Germain Act\") that may apply. It provides that the bank can't \"call\" (force immediate repayment) of a mortgage if the property owner dies and the property is inherited by a close family member ... as long as the heirs continue to make payments, the bank must leave the loan in place. Of course, if the heirs stop making payments, then the bank can foreclose.\n\nAs the other lawyers have indicated, you are not \"personally\" responsible for the credit card debts. However, there is a process that must be followed to either repay them or have them declared uncollectible.\n\nYou do that as part of a probate proceeding.\n\nIf you would like to start a probate proceeding, please phone my office to arrange an appointment. I would be happy to assist you.",
        "I agree with the prior answer. If the home is in San Francisco, then it's almost certain that a formal probate proceeding will be required. A spouse, child or sibling of the deceased would make the most appropriate administrator of the estate.

The process is very detail oriented and complicated, and takes 8-10 months to complete, when everything goes smoothly.",
        "The issue is complicated because of the real property. If the home has equity an heir should promptly act to become appointed as administration of the estate. This will require a petition in probate.

However, the estate will have to pay approved claims or claims that proceed to judgment against the decedent as part of the probate process. Also as part of the process, the administrator will collect the funds from any bank account and take control of the remainder of the decedent’s assets.\n\nThere is a simplified procedure that can be used in some cases but the value of all property in the estate must be equal to or less than $150,000. The $150,000 is gross. That means that if the house has a fair market value of $150,001 – the simplified procedure could not be used. The equity, i.e., the difference between the fair market value and the debt against the house is not the measure used.\n\nIf you are an heir in this estate I urge you or another heir to contact a probate attorney local to the county where the decedent resided. The attorney’s fees for representing the administrator, like the administrator’s fees, are paid from the estate so you would not have to pay any attorney fees from your own pocket."

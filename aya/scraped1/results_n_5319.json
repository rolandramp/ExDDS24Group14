    "title": "I have a chase credit card in collections ($4,500) and I currently bank with chase, can they levy my account without a judgment?",
    "question": "The debt went into collections over 4 years ago, it is my understanding that under current CA law, they can no longer sue me since I have not sent them any type of payment since then. Would Chase still be able to levy my account, even though I have the statue of limitations on my side, since the debt is with them? In order to avoid the chance of this happening I recently moved to a diff. bank and left the Chase acct. open, but I am very un happy with the new one and I am wondering if it is safe to go back to Chase? I am slowly paying off my debts by settling one by one as I can afford to, but Chase has the biggest balance, it more than doubled due to them selling it off over & over to diff. collection agencys over the past 4 years. I have not called to settle yet, refuse to pay over $1200",

        "The answer to your question will depend on whether or not your account is subject to a contract provision called a set off. This agreement, which you are probably unaware of, would have been implemented when you opened your account and signed a standard form to open the account. Alas, I have no way to know what was in the agreement you signed and you should go to your bank and ask to review a copy of that contract. Hope this perspective helps!",
        "I would need more information in order to properly advise you. You should read the account agreement and the credit card agreement, for starters. Also, did Chase assign the account to a \"debt buyer\"? If so, to whom?\n\nThe Statute of Limitations is an affirmative defense that you can raise if you are sued. The SOL does not prevent the bank from using a contractual right of set off, if the bank does, indeed, have that right.\n\nAn assignee (i.e. a debt buyer) cannot levy upon your bank account without a court judgment.",
        "Chase credit cards and Chase Bank are probably different entities, and cannot offset one's debt from deposits of another. That being said, you are taking a chance by banking with an entity you owe money to. Caution suggests that you bank elsewhere until you get a \"paid in full\" from the credit card debt."

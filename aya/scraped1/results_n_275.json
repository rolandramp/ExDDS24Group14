    "title": "How do I handle a trust as I’m the successor trustee?",
    "question": "The home I live in was in a irrevocable trust with my parents as co trustees. My mother passed away 2 weeks ago and I am the successor trustee. She was one year into a bankruptcy case that I filed with her power of attorney, to keep the house out of foreclosure as my father refused to pay back his loan. Now I have no idea how to proceed as I don’t speak to my father and I’m not sure his mental capabilities at 90 allow him to even run his half of the trust. The trust does say that all mental faculties must be intact. He has a new wife who is not part of this property as it was acquired in my parents marriage. She has however tried every tactic to force a sale , which I can’t prove. What needs to be done now? I’m on social security and have little income. I can no longer make the bankruptcy payments either. I am a beneficiary of the house with my sister whom I’d like to cut from being a beneficiary as she did nothing to help our dying mother. There is no other will. Any information is extremely appreciated. Thank you!",

I don't see how you save the property at this point but you can try to find an attorney by using the Find a Lawyer tab and calling around. With regarding to cutting out your sister - not going to happen. That is not your choice and people don't get disinherited by a hurt or angry sibling because they did not help a dying parent.",

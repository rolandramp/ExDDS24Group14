    "question": "Myself along with my ex and ex mother in-law signed a lease to rent a home, after 3 years my ex and I separated, I left the home leaving my name on the lease, 2 years have gone by since I've not lived in the home. Recently I found out my ex mother in-law filed, will I be affected in anyway because my name is still on the lease?",
    "answers": [
        "When you signed the lease, you and your co-tenants became \"jointly and severally\" liable. Which means that the landlord can collect the full amount of the rent due from any of you. Hindsight is twenty twenty, but when you left, you should have taken your name off the lease. There may be some work arounds., like if you gave the landlord thirty days notice when you moved out. Talk to a landlord tenant attorney.",
        "Yes. If your name on lease you are jointly and severally liable.",
        "You need to speak with an attorney there, but in general, if you co-signed debt, you are responsible for it."

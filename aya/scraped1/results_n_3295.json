    "title": "Which Proper Legal Form to Use?",
    "question": "I am being sued by a debt collector and intend to file my answer with LA Superior Court within the required 30 days of receiving the Summons. I understand forms are available online but I am not sure which form to use. This is a Civil Case, and I have found Form PLD-C-010 1/1/2007 Answer-Contract to file my Answer ( I found this online at www.lasuperiorcourt.org). Is this the correct Form? I want to fill out the correct form before I go to the Clerk's Window to save time. Thank You.",

    "title": "In California, what risk to 1st TD holder (seller financing) if buyer files bankruptcy?",
    "question": "Buyer wants to put 40% cash down and have seller carry the balance for one year with a recorded First Trust Deed. Buyer's credit report revealed a bankruptcy in 2009. If the buyer defaults on their payments for that seller financing, and then files for bankruptcy (again), does the seller stand to lose their 60% holding in the property 'secured' by the 1st TD? The property at issue would be considered as the buyer's primary residence.",
    "answers": [
        "Some things to consider:\n-If buyer defaults you may foreclose on property;\n-If buyer files BK, they may be relieved of personal liability for the debt;\n-If equity in property exceeds amount of debt, there is additional security for lender",
        "You are going to be a secured creditor. If Buyer fails to pay on the mortgage and files bankruptcy you can file a relief from stay in a Chapter 7. and foreclose on the house In a chapter 13, any arrearages will be rolled in to the plan and you will get paid. If the house has more equity than the Buyer is able to exempt and the Trustee seizes the house to use the nonexempt equity to pay the unsecured, you get paid first. None of those scenarios are ideal from your standpoint but you won't be hurt too badly. I would put a five year call position in the Deed of Trust so the Buyer has to refinance as soon as possible after the eight year moratorium on conventional financing after a mortage.",
        "I concur with atty Gambrell whose analysis is spot on. The carry back mortgage survives any BK filed by the buyer. Since the buyer filed in 2009, no chapter 7 can be filed until 2017 (with some exceptions). Seller should be OK and should survive any BK by the buyer.",
        "If the property is worth more than the amount of the secured debt, then the buyer would have to pay the claim in full through a chapter 13 plan in 5 years if he/she cannot get financing to pay off the loan when the balloon payment is due. Since the loan will be due prior to the end of a five year plan, the debtor can modify the interest rate to what is called a Till rate. In our jurisdiction, the current Till rate is presumed to be 5.0%, but it can be more or less depending upon the facts of the case.\n\nDebt can be discharged in bankruptcy but a valid purchase money TD or mortgage is still a valid lien on the debt whether the debtor files for relief under chapter 7, 13 or 11 of the bankruptcy code.",
        "Curious to AVVO how this appeared under Financial Markets and Services section. More appropriate under Bankruptcy and/or Real Estate, to which I unfortunately cannot comment."

    "title": "Getting divorced. No assets at this time but I have retirement accounts. Divorce agreement states that we split all debt and",
    "question": "assets. We (ex and I ) have a judgment from a lawsuit on a second mortgage (private investor, not a bank) that was defaulted on. I was unaware of the lawsuit (I moved), ex attended the hearing and lied that she was unemployed. They applied a garnishment for the full amount on my wages. I am fine with paying my share but want to assign her half to her. She is claiming barely any income (self employed) and says the only assets she has are my retirement accounts and spousal support. I do not need/want to declare bankruptcy as she suggests to get out from under. Can I have the amount she owes deducted from her portion of the retirement accounts and how do I go about that? I would like to get the QDRO finished.",

    "title": "Can anything be done if my attorney failed to file full declarations of disclosure in my response to divorce after set-aside?",
    "question": "I retained an attorney to help me set-aside a default judgment that'd been granted against me for failing to respond to divorce petition on time. We succeeded. Judge then set date for a spousal support hearing. Things went haywire after that with my attorney & ex-wife going back & forth about the I&E's she was submitting and my ex-wife's lack of proof to support for her ever-decreasing claims of current income. By the time support hearing concluded 3 sets of I&E's had been submitted by both sides and 9 months past. Support request was denied. Something didn't seem right but attorney said that's how it goes. I've had time to review the files, our exchanges and judge's findings & it's dawning on me that the response entered at the time the set-aside was granted was incomplete.",

        "Setting aside a default judgment allows you to file a response, which your attorney did. The fl-123 is the response for domestic partnerships, so I assume that's what you had. You need to separate the support issue from the issue of property division. If I&E declarations were filed by both parties, then the court had sufficient information to file on the spousal support request. If your ex submitted false or misleading info, and you had proof od that, that should have been brought up at the support hearing, assuming the false statements were relevant to the support issue.\n\nIf you filed the response, your case should be \"at issue,\" and if there is property to divide, that can still be done. Based on your description, it sounds like the judge denied your temporary spousal support request. If you need a further explanation of the procedure, you should contact an attorney through lawyer referral service, or go back to your own counsel if that is possible.",
        "1) \"the response entered at the time the set-aside was granted was incomplete.\" You provide no evidence of this and, given the generality of the response, it's very doubtful that it bears upon your support hearing.\n\n2) The preliminary disclosure is what's at issue. It consists largely of a schedule of assets and debts (all but irrelevant to spousal support hearings) and and income and expense declaration of which you had several.\n\n3) You need to consult with your attorney.",
        "First of all, Schedules of Assets and Debts do NOT get filed with the Court. What needs to be filed is proof that you served same on the opposing party. I am not sure what you are trying to accomplish. If you feel that your attorney made an error, then you can see if the error can be remedied. If the default was set aside - how can that be incomplete - it was either set aside or not. You have not provided enough information to evaluate your spousal support claim. It sounds like you need to have a consultation with an experienced family law attorney, with all of your paperwork, so that things can be sorted out and you can glean where you are in your case and what needs to be done to bring it to conclusion. You need to take responsibility for your participation in this action and be proactive. Even with that behavior, the Court process does take awhile."

    "title": "Chapter 7 Bankruptcy - Can creditors report you as late/charged off, etc., after petition filed?",
    "question": "I have creditors that are reporting me as late and charge offs after my bankruptcy petition was filed. My bankruptcy has also been discharged. Experian is refusing to remove the lates and/or charge offs without documentation about what the law states on this issue. I was under the impression that the automatic stay prevented creditors from negatively reporting after the petition was filed.",
    "answers": [
        "This could be a violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA). Consult an attorney in this area.",
        "No. Creditors may take no action to collect a debt after BK filed. Reporting \"late, charge off\" is a form of action to collect debt. Creditors cannot do this,\nYes. Reporting \"late, charge off\" is violation of BK Automatic Stay.",
        "I agree with Mr. Taylor and Mr. Riddle. The creditors can report any late payments, default, charge offs, etc. that occurred prior the to your Petition Date, the date you filed. However, the creditor should also show that the debt has a $0.00 balance, that it was included in the bankruptcy if it was not cancelled prior to filing and cannot report any post petition default or charge off, etc.\n\nYou should contact an attorney that handles Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) claims to determine if you there has been a violation.",
        "Accurate info can be reported after your filing. So if a creditor charged off your debt prior to filing and continues to report that afterwards, they are reporting accurate info. What the can't do is report a debt as \"owing\" post discharge.",
        "The purpose of a credit report is to accurately report your credit history and a Bankruptcy filing does not mean your credit history disappears and cant be reported. Did you have late payments or charge-offs before you filed? Those facts are missing? Does the report accurately reflect that some debts were discharged? More details are necessary."

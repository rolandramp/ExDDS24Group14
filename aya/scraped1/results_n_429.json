        "There are two choices you have, either pay the debt in full or retain an experienced CA bankruptcy to obtain a discharge of that debt and all other dischargable debts. But if the accident was caused by DWI/DUI then it will NOT be dischargable. THIS IS NOT LEGAL ADVICE! YOU NEED TO SPEAK TO AN ATTORNEY WHO IS LICENSED IN YOUR STATE FOR LEGAL ADVICE. This is merely suggestions for you to think about in discussing your situation with the local attorney.",
        "There are two possibilities: pay it off in full or discharge the debt in bankruptcy. The debt will be dischargeable unless DUI was involved.",
        "The best option for you is to pay what is owed. One should not ever drive without insurance. Once the debt is satisfied, you can get your license back."

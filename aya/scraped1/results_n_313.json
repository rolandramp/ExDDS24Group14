        "Agreed with Mr. Steingraber. Your question seems like just an accounting question, not a bankruptcy question.",
        "As far as I know, the allocation of your mortgage payment is controlled by your loan documents. I am unaware of any bankruptcy code pertaining to that.",
        "Without knowing why you are asking the question, we really can only guess at the actual issue you are trying to address. Various parts of the Bankruptcy Code deal with creditors and their claims. Some issues may be addressed in the plan itself. You should discuss whatever issue with which you are concerned with your attorney. If you don't have one, now is the time to hire one. They can be paid through the plan, so hiring one shouldn't be cost prohibitive.",
        "You should contact your attorney. Otherwise, you need to retain an attorney, since there are a significant number of things that can go wrong in any bankruptcy. To properly answer your questions and address your concerns, the best way to handle this is with an in person consultation with an experienced CA bankruptcy attorney. Use AVVO's Find a Lawyer tool to select a qualified attorney. Good luck. THIS IS NOT LEGAL ADVICE! YOU NEED TO SPEAK TO AN ATTORNEY WHO IS LICENSED IN YOUR STATE FOR LEGAL ADVICE. This is merely suggestions for you to think about in discussing your situation with the local attorney."

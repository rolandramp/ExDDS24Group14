    "title": "My mother died. Oldest sister is executrix. I'm estranged and want to know what is happening to house she paid off in full.",
    "question": "She may owe nursing home for care and board and city loan obtained to refurbish house and yards 15 years ago. She had a will that states all 5 children get equal shares of whatever there is to split. I am estranged and can't ask any of them. She died Jan. 25 2015. Sister has always told me the city was taking the house but my brother has been there cleaning up yards. Why would he do that if it was going to be taken from us. It doesn't make any sense. I would like to know and stop stressing over it as I am a Stroke Survivor and not supposed to be under any stress!",

        "Probate would be started in the county your mother lived in. Check the court records there.\nAs others have said, if no probate is started, wait about 60 days, then start the probate with you as Administrator and your mother as intestate.

    "title": "What are my chances for an Annulment? Or do I get a Divorce?",
    "question": "I want to get an annulment with my husband. He is fraud of his character and lied and hid his debts that he owe which is 35,000,00+. We have a car together. Car payments are for 5yrs. I dont want the car nor do I want his money. I am by the way 9weeks pregnant so now a baby is involved. He is a military vet and has a very bad mental condition. He was fine up untill his mom falsely accused me of cheating thats when his mental health kicked in and he tried killing himself. I do have 3 other kids and are just looking out for my kids.",

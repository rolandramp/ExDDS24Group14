    "title": "Can the FTB go after my personal accounts and assets to collect the yearly LLC tax fee or can they only pursue LLC assets?",
    "question": "The FTB in CA is trying to collect $6,800 in back taxes for years 2010 through final year 2014. I was not aware of this yearly fee until I finally got a bill from the FTB last December 2014. The LLC never made money and was not actively pursuing business after 2009. Since I was unaware of a yearly fee I just left the LLC as is and forgot about it. Do I have a personal liability to pay this fee or can the FTB only collect through the LLC itself?",
    "answers": [
        "No; the $800 LLC minimum tax is not a personal liability. Even the FTB admits on its website that \"In general, all the owners (members) are shielded from individual liability for debts and obligations of the LLC.\"\nBut, the FTB has recently refused to provide an opinion to that effect. So, the FTB will send you countless notices that the LLC must pay the $800 LLC minimum tax, but in fact you are not personally liable for same and can ignore the notices. However, there are some exceptions and for that reason, you should talk to a state and local tax attorney for advice. Good luck!",
        "The debt for taxes is that of the LLC, not the owner(s).",

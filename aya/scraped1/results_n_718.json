    "question": "Hi! My husband is going to file a bankruptcy after we have filed for divorce. We have joint IRS debt which we are going to split on a voluntary bases by means of divorce settlement. I know that this debt will become my burden if his debts get discharged. Is there any option for me to get a relief from his share? Does it make difference what should go first: divorce or bankruptcy?",

        "Depending on your assets will depend on what you file first.\nIf you have more assets than you can exempt from the Bankruptcy Estate then I would wait 2 years after the Marital Property Settlement that divides the Community Property has been entered in your Divorce Case and final judgment regarding the property is entered.\nIf you don't need to worry about guarding assets, then file the bankruptcy first so that all dischargeable debts are discharged before they are identified on the Property Settlement.\nIf you filed joint returns, you are jointly liable on the IRS Debt. There are certain rules that allow for discharge of income taxes in bankruptcy, and the IRS will look for the non-filing spouse to collect all of the debt.\nYou may want to consider a consultation with a bankruptcy attorney who is also experienced in determining when taxes are discharged. If the taxes are dischargeable then you may want to file together. One case, one court filing fee, one attorney fee - if you are able to work together.",
        "You may file petition with IRS for relief of half of debt.\nImpossible to advise order in which to file BK and dissolution without more case specific information.",
        "There is nowhere near enough information here to advise you on your options or answer your questions. The tax debt may be dischargeable in bankruptcy, but the only way to tell is to have an experienced bankruptcy attorney review the actual tax transcripts from the IRS to see if all the prerequisites have been met.\n\nFor a guideline on what is needed for that, see https://www.bklaw.com/bankruptcy-taxes/\n\nAs for what to do first, you should have a consultation with a bankruptcy attorney to assess your options and then decide what makes sense under your specific fact situation.",
        "Not enough facts here to know for sure what to do.\nBut if your IRS debt is not at least three years old, he won't be discharging it in his BK.\nIf it IS dischargeable, however, and your settlement agreement has the appropriate language to hold each other harmless from the 1/2 of the debt each is assuming, then he may be discharged of the tax debt but he would still owe YOU for his 1/2 if you end up having to pay it. As you can see, if the debt is dischargeable, it would be really really smart to file jointly before your divorce is final."

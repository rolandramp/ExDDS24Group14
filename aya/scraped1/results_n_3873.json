    "title": "How can I dissolve an LLC when I'm 50% owner and the other 50% owner does not want to dissolve?",
    "question": "I have tried offering to buy her out, and she refuses at any price. I have also offered her to buy me out for only the amount that I orginially put into the business ($150,000 ish) to pay for inventory and build-out. She says that she's unable to come up with the money. Meanwhile, she has been embezzling funds nearly everyday and I am pursuing legal action. However, this takes time and money. I've been told that the police is so busy that they rarely intervene. What am I to do? I want to end this LLC ASAP as I doubt I'll ever see the funds that were embezzled. Time to cut my losses",

        "You can file for an involuntary dissolution of the entity. Any good business litigator can help you effectuate this \"nuclear option\" which can be combined with a lawsuit for breach of fiduciary duty and conversion (theft).",
        "The LLC cannot function because of the impasse. You may need to petition the Court for a decree of dissolution. Check the operating agreement to see if there is a provision to break the tie.",
        "With this being an LLC, look to the operating agreement and see how that document sets up the dissolution (hopefully you have one). You likely have to bring an action with the Court in order to dissolve the company and figure out who owes who, and how much. It appears that you are otherwise at an impasse, and as such, it is time for the legal system. I can appreciate the idea of cutting your losses, and under some circumstances, that might be appropriate. However, if you have any joint debts, company debts, personal guarantees, or taxes then that issue may continue and you may be solely liable. Visit with a CA attorney and get some solid advice. Best of luck."

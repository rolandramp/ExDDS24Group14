        "Typically if a debt was included in a bankruptcy, the bankruptcy was not yours. For example, if you co-signed a debt and your cosigner filed bankruptcy, the debt was included in a bankruptcy, but you were not discharged. Another possibility this phase could mean is that the debt was not (yet) discharged by a bankruptcy. Hope this perspective helps!",
        "In means the debt was listed in the schedules in a bankruptcy petition.\n\nDischarged: The debt was discharged in a bankruptcy and is no longer collectable by any creditor.\n\nCharged-Off: Accounting term used by creditors to identify accounts that are bad and they have taken as a loss on their books. However, the debt is still valid and owed by the Debtor.",
        "Presumably, you filed for bankruptcy at some point in the past. Included means that it was listed on the creditors list in your bk petition. If you got a discharge, then all included debts were discharged (no obligation to pay back)."

    "title": "How much total income to File Chapter 7",
    "question": "I am considering Chapter 7 due to excessive (charged off) credit card debt and one pending lawsuit due to credit card debt. I work full-time but only make a little under $13.00 per hr. which is less than $20,000 per year. I live alone but half my rent if paid by a family member (it is a gift) which (their portion of the rent) per year = $7800.00 per year. Is this included as part of my Total Income, and will I still qualify for Chapter 7? I have no other debts besides the charged off credit cards (about $10,000) and no assets except my old car which I now own (appx. $5000). Also, will I have to provide copies of my bank statements for the Trustee to examine when I go to Court? What if I subscribe to a few inexpensive novelties like Netflix $8, gym dues etc. will this disqualify me? T/Y.",

        "Agree with colleagues. Based on information you provided, you qualify for C7 bankruptcy discharge. income not a problem. Yes. Family contribution to rent will be considered income. Charges off debts should be included in your BK petition and schedules. They will be discharged. Vehicle and other assets are exempt and protected. You will keep them. Bank statements are required. trustee entitled to review bank statements. Subscriptions you described are not a problem. You can keep them. Hire competent BK counsel to proceed.",
        "Yes, it sounds like you would definitely qualify even with the portion of your rent that is given as a gift. The trustee may request to see your bank statements but this is unlikely in a case like yours. With the right attorney your case should be fairly painless. Give an attorney a call for a free consult to discuss your situation.",
        "You are a chapter 7, but based on the questions you are asking, I would say that you really need a bankruptcy attorney to help you through the process. Don't be penny wise and pound foolish.",
        "Yes, the gift is included and yes you likely qualify for a Chapter 7. If the debts are charged off and you have made no payments and no promise of payment you might want to wait out the 4 year statute of limitations at which point the debt may be uncollectible. You will provide bank statements to your attorney and they will be provided to the Trustee if requested. Netfilx etc. are living expenses and as long as they are not outrageous you should be okay. I would take all paperwork requested to an attorney for a free consultation (including most recent collection letters) and strategize whether to file and if so, when to file. You sound like a good candidate for Public Counsel's free self-help desk. Best of luck to you.",
        "You need and want to enjoy your fresh start also. But the most important thing is to meet with an attorney as you asking this question means you have not. You care about 2 goals: keeping everything you have equity in and discharging all your debts. If you don't have any of the exceptions to discharge you will obtain that goal; most exceptions are set forth in 11 USC. 523 (Google it) like child support, some income taxes, traffic (in a ch 7) and criminal fines , and presumption of student loans. But some debts are dischargeable in a ch 13 but NOT in a ch 7 so you want to make sure and your attorney will discuss any such types with you also!\n\nYour question on gift income is YES>>it is income..so listed in Statement of Financial Affairs, the Means Test Form 22, and Schedule I. But you are fine..most individuals fail to list all expenses and event the new forms Schedule J effective 12-1-13 are deficient I believe in asking some expenses..like gifts, tobacco, kids sports,, all car repairs, licenses , tabs, YOUR drivers license, house maintenance like $75 a month is $900 a year for replacement mattress, tv, vcr, blue ray, etc..just look around and think all the stuff bought and wanted but NOT food or clothes! Entertainment of $100 a month includes Netflix, gym dues, etc.. Don't worry..just see the attorney!\n\nYour exemptions depend on what state you have lived in in the last 2 years and thus if in your state, then your states exemptions will apply. Most persons filing keep everything they own but your attorney will confirm that with you when they learn everything you own and the equity thereof including that $5,000 car which DONT overvalue it (check on AutoTrader).\n\nSome secured debts like homes, vehicles, other secured debts an attorney will discuss your options on also as you must list any debts; but that does not mean you will lose them unless you have too much equity or are in default on paying for them! Discuss those options if they apply with your attorney too.\n\nBut other issues can arise that can greatly harm your case. Just one example: If you paid back a relative $3,000 11 months ago and now file bankruptcy next week, the trustee can SUE that relative to retrieve that $3,000 (under what is called a preference) for the benefit of the bankruptcy estate. As a result, most attorneys don't charge to meet with them the first meeting so meet with one no matter what.\n\nMany great attorneys can be found right here on AVVO in your state so look, call, and meet one as soon as you can.\n\nYou should also want to know when to file: is there an advantage of waiting versus filing now and who should you pay between now and then! Good luck and enjoy your later fresh start.",

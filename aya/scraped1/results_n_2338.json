    "title": "What are the potential risks to sponsor an I864 applicant.",
    "question": "As the sponsor of the I864 applicat, do I need to be responsible if the applicant has medical bills beyond the insurance coverage or do i need to be responsible for other civil liabilities, car accident etc?",
    "answers": [
        "You are not responsible for medical bills. If the sponsored person receives welfare you may be obligated to repay those funds to the government.",
        "Not for civil liabilities generally. The government can seek to get reimbursement from you for certain benefits, but civilly only the individual sponsored can seek support -and then only up to the 125% of poverty line level for a household of their size.\n\nSee the linked legal guide, and consult an attorney.",
        "It is confusing and my colleagues correctly pointed out that the government can seek reimbursement from you for 'means test' benefits received and the beneficiary may be able to sue you to provide some coverage.\n\nHaving good insurance policies can best protect you."

    "title": "Does a sister state judgement restart the statute of limitations?",
    "question": "I had a default judgement entered against me in 2005 in MS; it was then transferred to WA in May 2011and finally to CA in Nov 2011. The original judgement expired in 2012, does the CA sister state judgement filing count as a renewal? I have received notice of wage garnishment for this judgement and would like advice on how to proceed.",
    "answers": [
        "There is no statute of limitations on a judgment. There is an expiration of the judgment, however--unless it is renewed, it cannot be enforced as a judgment. Mississippi judgments are good for 7 years, unless renewed. I do not know off the top of my head whether filing the judgment in California would extend this period or whether the Mississippi judgment was renewed. Check with a local attorney.",
        "If the creditor obtained a valid judgment in 2005 and proceeded to domesticate the judgment in 2011 (by filing documents in a court near where you live), its not likely that you will be able to challenge the judgment at this point, especially if you have known about it for a while. However, you do still have a couple of options: 1) file a claim of exemption within 10 days of the date you received notice of the garnishment. A claim of exemption can be successful if you use all of your income for basic living expenses; 2) file a bankruptcy case to discharge that debt and others that you may have.",
        "The Statute of Limitations does not apply in your case. The SOL is an affirmative defense, which you must plead in your Answer to Complaint and prove at trial. If the lawsuit is filed with the court before the SOL runs, it is timely. If a default judgment is properly entered, there is nothing you can do to bring up the Statute of Limitations. A claim can be 100 years old, but if you do not respond to the lawsuit, the SOL does not apply.\n\nDid you have a good reason for allowing your default to be entered in 2005?"

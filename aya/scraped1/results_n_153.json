    "title": "If I reported potential fraud to the trustee and he ignores it can I send info to judge?",
    "question": "I’ve provided proof that this women lied on her filing and that she has a net disposable income of $1,300-1,700 a month, she filed for chapter 7 with about $55k of debt, having a net disposable income of 1300-1700 should allow her to pay her creditors. The trustee in the case filed a Report of No Distribution today, does this mean she’s getting away with fraud? I have sent all the documents to the US trustee fraud department as well. It would be wrong if they let this person abuse the system. Can I also send the information to the Judge? The trustee knows this lady perjured herself in the 341 and he still filed Report of No Distribution? What else can I do so this women does get away with this?",

        "You should seek direct counsel with an experienced bankruptcy attorney before you do anything else. Typically, the trustee is concerned primarily with unexempt assets. While fraud perpetrated on the court might be a subject of interest, it depends on the facts.\n\nYou cannot send something to the judge. That is not at all the way things are done. If you want to spend money on this, you can hire an attorney, file an Adversary Proceeding against the debtor objecting to her discharge and proceed. This will likely cost much more in fees that is owed to you, unless you are owed an extremely high amount. If there is not fraud under that statute, you lose; if you can prove by clear and convincing evidence that there was fraud of the type defined under that statute and you win, then you are back where you started trying to collect the debt owed to you.\n\nBut talk to a qualified bankruptcy attorney first! There are deadlines involved too. Bottom line though, it is probably not worth it under the circumstances you described (you may be misinterpreting the law) and if you just send something to the judge, nothing will happen."

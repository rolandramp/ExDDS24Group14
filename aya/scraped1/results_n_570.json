    "title": "Iâ€™m in the process of filing a chapter7 bankruptcy in CA. I was wondering if I have to file a reaffirmation agreement?Pros/Cons?",
    "question": "My lien holder is Toyota, I want to know if I should call and get a reaffirmation agreement? What happens if I do not get the debt reaffirmed? Will the car be repossessed? I am current on all my payments. Do I need a lawyers representation to file the reaffirmation? How does the reaffirmation work?",
    "answers": [
        "This is a good question. You do not need an attorney's representation to file a reaffirmation agreement, however, attorney representation is always recommended in a bankruptcy case, as there are a lot of technical rules that you need to make sure to follow in order for you to receive your discharge. You do not have to reaffirm the vehicle. The benefit is if you do they will continue reporting on time payments to the credit bureaus, thus, helping rebuild your credit. The cons are that by reaffirming you are reaffirming your liability, so, if you are ever late on payments in the future and they repossess then you will be liable for the deficiency balance (balance on loan minus what they sell the vehicle for at auction). They can sue you, try and garnish your pay check, levy your bank account, etc. If you do not reaffirm, they can technically repossess if the lien company requires a reaffirmation, however, if you remain current on payments the lien holder will almost positively not repossess the vehicle since you are current under your contract. That being said, I normally do not recommend signing a reaffirmation. If you want to keep the vehicle, keep making payments on it. This way, in the future, if you ever do not want the vehicle any more you can just turn it into the lien holder and walk away without owing a penny. Hope this helps!",

    "title": "Can I have payments made on a title loan apply to the current balance in a Chapter 13 BK?",
    "question": "I have a 2004 vehicle with a current value of less than $1000. I took out a title loan about a year ago for $3600 and have made payments of about $3400 so far. Currently I think I owe about $3800. If I file Chapter 13 Bankruptcy, will the cars current value and payments made be considered in what needs to be repaid or only the current loan amount? If I do file Chapter 13, is there any chance for me to get a small loan for a cheap vehicle with better mileage (currently getting about 7 MPG) so I am not buried?",

        "I have an office in Vista, CA so I figured I should chime in. As suggested by others, you can likely cram down the loan to the value of the vehicle. Keep in mind, however, that your definition of value and the car creditors definition of value, may not be the same figure. Some creditors are aggressive about the final number, some are not. Put another way, value, in this context, is fungible. As far as getting a new loan during an open Ch. 13, that is very difficult to achieve, as most new lenders are very afraid of being pulled into an open bankruptcy, be it Ch. 13 or Ch. 7.",
        "To answer the question on whether you can get a loan for a new vehicle:\n\nOne option is to let the vehicle go, that way the trustee can not only \"cram down\", as the other attorneys mentioned, but the trustee may limit the amount you will pay on the car even more. Typically I have clients who often get quality used cars right after filing. Some dealers specialize or cater to people in debt, but you have to really ask around for a good dealer to avoid getting a lemon.",
        "If you want to keep the vehicle, a cram down is the way to go. You will pay the value of the car through your Chapter 13. This would be $1,000. At the end of the Plan, you get title.",
        "You can likely have your obligation on the vehicle \"crammed down\" to it's value, in this case, about $1000. But I hope you are thinking of doing this in consultation with a lawyer; do it yourself Chapter 13 plans usually don't work out very well. Good luck.",
        "Most Chapter 13 Plans allow you to \"cram down\" a title loan to fair market value. If you make your vehicle payments through your Chapter 13 Plan, you can also write your own interest rate.\n\nBut having said that, if the vehicle is no good, why keep it? Just get another vehicle & surrender the dog.\n\nHope this perspective helps!"

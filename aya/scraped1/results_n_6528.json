        "Attorneys are exempt from the provisions of the Rosenthal Act.

Check out the aforementioned code for a more instruction.",

Both statutes mandate that debt collectors not use any illegal, deceptive or harassing debt collection tactics when attempting to collect the debt.\n\nOne of the primary considerations in determining whether the FDCPA and RFDCPA apply, is the status of the person collecting the debt.

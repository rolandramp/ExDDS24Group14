        "Best thing you can do is, document, document, an document! Keep records of all checks you are giving her. Ideally, you would just direct deposit it to her which would keep her from not taking the money. The only thing you need to worry about is her coming after you for child support arrears (debts). All she need to do is allege, and the Court will ask you to show proof that you made payment or attempted payment. If she is trying to allege arrears to get interest payments, then you could use the proof that you gave her the checks (may need to file declarations or credible testimony that show how the checks were sent to her (certified mail, third party personal service, etc.), and it is possible that in the spirit of equity that the Court could disallow any interest accrual.\n\nI take it DCSS (Department of Child Support Services) is not collecting the support for you. If they were, you would be garnished or would be paying them directly, and there would be a proven track record of your payments. Just keep sending her checks, preferably in a way that you can track their movement towards her, or try to do direct deposit so that you continue to show good faith in complying with the Court order."

    "title": "Can I just write my second mortgage lender a letter and ask for debt forgiveness?",
    "question": "My house worth 150K has a first mortgage for 160k, and a second for 155k. The second was originally just a second to pay off debts, then sold again to another mortgage company. I have not paid anything on the second in two years. I am afraid of the property going up in value, and the second mortgage company maybe foreclosing sometime . Can I simply just ask the second mortgage company to forgive my debt? What do you think the chances are that it would work? Would I be liable for any taxes on the1099 they file since originally the loan was not for home improvements? Would I qualify for mortgage debt forgiveness?",

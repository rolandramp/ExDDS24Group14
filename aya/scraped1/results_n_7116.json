    "title": "How to avoid involuntary lien on property after bankruptcy closed?",
    "question": "My Chapter 7 bankruptcy was closed with a discharge and no objections last year. However, I did not file a motion to avoid lien on an involuntary lien a creditor (who was discharged in my bk) had on my property prior to my filing. I am now trying to short sale my home and this creditor is claiming that their lien must be addressed. Do I have to reopen my bankruptcy to file a motion to avoid the lien? Are there any other options since this debt was already discharged and I don't want to pay to reopen? Thank you in advance.",
    "answers": [
        "Here's the other option. Buy or rent a time machine. Go back to before you filed your case. Hire a lawyer who will do a title search, identify the lien, and do whatever is needed to avoid it during your case.",
        "You will need to reopen your case and then file a motion to avoid the judicial lien. You will need to be sure that the tests are met and properly pled in your motion. You will have to pay a fee to reopen the case, a fee for the motion, and the appraisal fee, in addition to any attorneys fees. While a motion to avoid a judicial lien is not particularly difficult, it must be done properly or the judge will deny it and you will have to fix what is wrong and refile it. If you are not experienced with researching and applying case law, this is a matter best left to a qualified attorney.",
        "My colleague asks a very good question, that is- why are you bothering w/ a short sale? This typically benefits only the realtors, not you. While you could re-open the BK to file a motion to avoid lien under 11 USC 522(f), why bother?\n\nEither let your realtor negotiate the lien w/ the buyer and/or lien holder (to be paid out of the purchase price or sales commission), or just wait until the property is foreclosed.",
        "You can file a motion to reopen your bankruptcy case to do so or it may be more cost effective to simply negotiate away the release of the lien with the subject lien holder especially if time is of the essence.\nGood luck!",
        "The lien creditor should realize that the debt is discharged and can be wiped out. His insistence on collecting on the debt on a value less lien is indeed frustrating but he may be willing to accept a small carrot to go away. Offer him something or better still have the Realtor do it since it is the Realtor who is making the money.\nAnd by way why are you bothering with a short sale? Unless the bank or the realtor are offering you moving expenses you might consider just staying there until the property is foreclsoed. Hopefully your realtor didn't ask you to move it while the short sale was being processed.\n\nI cant recommend reopening the case, since you really do not benefit from the short sale, and avoiding the lien as reopening the case can sometimes have other problems.\n\nYou should also note that once this house is gone, the creditor's lien should not attach to any new property you buy, as there is no other debt owed this creditor and if he tries to strong arm you in the future contact a good consumer attorney.",
        "In short, the answer is no.",
        "Unless a lien is removed on a proactive basis through the bankruptcy, it is as good as gold! Mr O's suggestion of buying a time machine is a creative, although impractical, solution.\n\nHope this perspective helps!"

    "title": "I have a question about debt in chapter 13? Can someone come after you after a debt was already paid in chapter 13?",
    "question": "I had an equalization payment that I owed an ex-wife due to a divorce. I including that in my chapter 13 plan. The good part is while I am in bankruptcy I only pay between 3% to 6% interest versus the 10% interest in family court. My question is once it is paid can my ex take me back to family court claiming that she was not paid in full? I don't want to pay her in chapter 13 and then have to pay her more after the chapter 13 is complete. It seems from what I have read I am only protected while in bankruptcy, but nor after bankruptcy. I owed her $38,000 in equity, so she is getting that plus interest. It is not support obligations etc. No alimony or child support is included. It is purely a property settlement. I just want to make sure I don't pay her twice.",

        "When you pay a claim in a Chapter 13 Plan there should be no reason you have to pay the same claim again elsewhere. If the Equalization is paid in full then they will let you know it's paid and that is your proof to everyone. However, talk to your attorney about your concerns.",
        "Property settlements are dischargeable dad in chapter 13 so long as the date was clearly classified as such Andrew or spouse did not file a complaint to determine discharge ability that would be discharged Your attorney that represented you in the chapter 13 should make this clear",
        "Normally a property settlement can be discharged in Chapter 13. So the unpaid interest should be discharged. The trick is the classification of a claim as property settlement or support. Bankruptcy courts do not rely on the labels used by the state court in the divorce order. So a state court can label something a property settlement, but the bankruptcy court may disagree and deem the obligation as support. The terms of your confirmed plan have a bearing on the answer as well. Given the complexity of your case, I assume you have a lawyer. Be sure to run this question by your lawyer."

    "title": "Will a bankruptcy stop or stay a civil lawsuit for fraud?",
    "question": "I am currently unemployed with few assets. The cost of defending a civil lawsuit has brought me to a point I have few funds to continue to defend myself. Will bankruptcy stop or stay a civil lawsuit?",
    "answers": [
        "Yes it will, unless you prior bankruptcy filings in the past 1 year. You should seek local counsel in this situation without a doubt. If your lawsuit was for fraud, you may be getting an adversary proceeding. In short, do yourself a huge favor, and get a lawyer.",
        "Yes it will under the \"Automatic Stay\" provisions of the Federal Bankruptcy Code. Itis most likely, however, that the plaintiff in the State Court action will simply file another case in the Bankruptcy Court known as an adversary proceeding alleging that their particular debt should be held to be non-dischargable under one of the \"fraud\" exceptions contained in 11 USC Section 522.",
        "I agree with all the answers by my colleagues. I wanted to add that even though a fraud claim may not be dischargeable, it is often a really good strategy to stop the bleeding by bringing it into the federal forum. You should send your case to a local bankruptcy attorney that handles civil trials and federal adversary actions to develop a strategy.",
        "The filing of the bankruptcy will stay the civil suit. In order for the claim to be non-dischargeable, the creditor would need to file an adversary proceeding seeking to have the debt to be found to be non-discargeable, presumably on the basis of the fraud. He would not only need to prove that the amount of the debt that was owing but would need to prove the fraud as well. This process can prove to be quite costly for the creditor and seeing that you are unemployed with few assets, the creditor may very well decide that pursuing an adversary proceeding does not make economic sense.",
        "If you are verifiably judgment proof, demonstrating that fact can sometimes be sufficient to cause the plaintiff to abandon the claim or action. The lawsuit is only worthwhile to the plaintiff if there is a possibility of collecting on a judgment -- now or in the future.",
        "Yes, bankruptcy filing will stay the current lawsuit; but the plaintiff may thereafter file an 'adversary proceeding' - which is a trial, for the same cause of action as the current suit - within the bankruptcy court. If you lose in that proceeding the debt to this particular plaintiff will not be discharged. On the other hand, maybe the plaintiff will not file an Adversary Proceeding in the BR. Do you have other debts to justify a BR filing? Consult an attorney, as it is complicated.",
        "The bankruptcy will stay the lawsuit, for a period of time. Consult with a local, experienced bankruptcy attorney to help you with this. You do not need to attempt this on your own. Good luck!",
        "If you file now, an automatic stay occurs and the civil lawsuit will be stayed. Once the BK is completed, your debts will be discharged and most likely the plaintiffs bringing the civil suit against you won't be able to pursue the claim anymore.\n\nConsult a local BK attorney ASAP!\n\nBest of luck.",
        "As long as you have not had two prior bankruptcies pending within the last year, a bankruptcy filing will stay the fraud lawsuit--at least for a while. Debts incurred because of fraud, however, are not dischargeable in bankruptcy. So if the creditor believes that there was fraud, they can file a new lawsuit in the bankruptcy court asking the court to determine that there was fraud and that the debt, therefore, cannot be discharged in bankruptcy.\n\nYou should consult an experienced bankruptcy attorney from your jurisdiction as soon as possible to figure out what course of action makes most sense for you.\n\nGood luck.",
        "The lawsuit will be stayed. If the plaintiff wishes to proceed, they need to file an adversary proceeding against you in the bankruptcy case and prove that the debt was incurred by fraud and therefore not dischargeable in bankruptcy. You must be list the plaintiff in your bankruptcy schedules and give them notice of the bankruptcy filing."

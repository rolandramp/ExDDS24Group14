    "title": "Chapter 7 in CA. If my estranged wife filed 2 yrs ago, & I file now, will her prior individual filing affect me & my exemptions?",
    "question": "She filed at a time when we were separated. We were in divorce proceedings at the time and still are. She listed our home and intended to surrender. At the time there was no equity. I want to file now (being the other owner and the other person on the loan); There is some equity now. I just want to know whether her prior filing could affect me in anyway. I plan on hiring a lawyer, but am just doing some research.",

        "This is actually the flip side of a joint bankruptcy petition.\n\nThe language of 11 USC 302 reflects that the filing of a joint bankruptcy petition results in the fulfillment of Congressional design: that is for administrative convenience for all parties. Upon filing a joint petition, there is but one filing fee and the appointment of only one bankruptcy trustee.\nI refer to the case of In re Estrada, 224 B.R. 132, 135 (Bankr. S.D. Cal. 1998).\n\nNow in this case you and your wife were separated and a divorce proceeding was pending in California on the date of the filing of her individual Bankruptcy petition.\n\nOne aspect of state law that has an impact on Bankruptcy law is whether or not at the time the petition was filed the parties were separated. See Fam. Code 770-772. If so, then the spouse making the elections has no standing to make the elections without being joined by the other spouse.\n\nThis is so because the community as in community property, ceases to exist at that point and both spouses become fiduciaries to each other, resulting in a relationship where each spouse must safeguard the marital property for the other but may not adversely bind the other to any decisions he or she makes.\n\nI might add it is a maxim of equity that the court that obtains jurisdiction over the asset first, retains plenary power over that asset, even though in this case, the bankruptcy court may have authority under the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution. This has more to do with a doctrine called \"Comity\" than it does with the Supremacy Clause, but the bottom line is, one court of equity (bankruptcy) will not interfere with another court of equity (dissolution/divorce court) if the former obtained jurisdiction first.\n\nTo make this uncomplicated, I will put it this way: your wife could make any election she wanted, and that may be good for her half of the community estate, assuming the Trustee chose to pursue it and would have intervened in the divorce case. But almost every Trustee I have met chickens out when it comes to intervening in state court litigation -- which is expensive, time consuming and counter productive.\n\nIt sounds to me like the Trustee did what most Trustees do and abandoned all property. If nothing has been taken either directly or by turnover from your estranged wife, then in all likelihood its too late, and the property is abandoned. If it is abandoned, it goes back to the divorce court.\n\nCould her prior filing affect you? Yes, anything's possible and we don't know what happened in her case. A good lawyer will pull up her docket on PACER and look at every piece of paper in there including the petition, schedules, statement of financial affairs and everything else. If there is a notice of abandoning property or assets, that ends the inquiry and you're free to do what you have to do.\n\nHowever, I believe because you two were separated, neither of you could make a self-interested decision about the remains of the marital estate, since the \"community\" has been severed, it becomes harder for a Bankruptcy Trustee to glom onto an asset that may or may not be community property during a period of legitimate separation.",
        "I agree with Mr. Salanick. At the time of her filing, you should have been required to acknowledge that you could be bound by your wife's choice of exemptions if you later filed BK. This is because: 1) CA has opted out of the federal exemptions; 2) CA has two different exemption schedules; 3) CA is a community property state; 4) husband and wife must jointly choose one. DO NOT RELY on advice from BK attorneys who do not practice in CA. There advise on this issue is inaccurate. I do hope you will retain counsel to advise you and file your BK. Failure to do so could be very expensive – far more than the cost of representation.",
        "I respectfully disagree with those answers offering that her prior case cannot affect your later filed case, under the conditions you've described.\n\nIn California, your question is a good one. Your separated spouse's prior filing (you were non-filing spouse, correct?) and her choice of exemptions may impact your ability to choose exemptions now. Whether she elected 703 exemptions or 704 exemptions (permitting a family to protect up to $100,000 in homestead equity, for instance), surely may impact your ability to now claim and use either/ or exemption scheme in your later filed chapter 7 bankruptcy.\n\nBe sure to seek counsel and advice from an experienced California bankruptcy lawyer prior to filing bankruptcy for yourself. The information and services you receive may prove extremely valuable to you well into the future.",
        "First, you should check to see if her bankruptcy case is CLOSED (Not discharged but \"closed\"). If closed, then any assets she listed come back into your divorce case to be distributed. And if you file, such assets you will list also. Whether you live In the home can affect your exemptions. Such that if she lived there when she filed, and now possibly you do, then your exemptions may now be maximized. If you do NOT live there and intend to, discuss this with your bankruptcy attorney also as to moving in before you file. Lastly, you ask how does it affect you? We do NOT know if you ever filed another bankruptcy before. But this is a very hardly ever cited bankruptcy rule which confuses many attorneys and judges and comes up at our seminars hardly at all..even though it should be. Why? Because it is hard to follow really! 11 U.S.C. 524 (a) GOVERNS cases against the ability to enforce claims against community assets which your case involves being you live in California. If all our creditors wrote the debts off and all were incurred during your marriage, you many not have any coming after you. But otherwise, they cannot enforce the debts against any community assets, only separate property. Irregardless though, all you care is if case is closed, can you keep all your property with equity and can you discharge all your debts! That is what it all comes down to. However, your answers to other questions of attorneys will or could affect our advice to you. Just call and meet with an experienced bankruptcy attorney who has practiced many years and you will then know the answers to those questions. I find most persons who read about bankruptcy misread something or misunderstand it. So meet with the attorney and good luck.",
        "Your ex-wife's bankruptcy filing won't affect your bankruptcy. She got her exemptions at the time of her bankruptcy and couldn't take any of your exemptions. You will have all your exemptions entitled by law.",
        "I am hard pressed, in a normal scenario, to think of how her prior filing would affect your filing. The only way her prior filing would affect your filing is if you lied or misrepresented something on your petition. For example, if her petition said you guys owned a vacation cabin in Canada, and you still own it, and didn't disclose it on your petition, that would be a problem.\n\nOther than that, you are filing separate cases and the cases are separate."

    "title": "What is \"NET INCOME\" for Alameda County Spousal Support Formula?",
    "question": "Is net income for the Alameda County Spousal Support Calculation just simply the take home from one's paycheck. It is an assumption based on the tax filing status of the parties? Can you calculate it with the parties paychecks by hand (40% of high earners net pay less 50% of low earners net pay) or do you need to use the Dissomater to make the assumptions about net income based on tax filing statuses. There are no children involved.",
    "answers": [
        "There are other components that need to be considered so the straight up 40% less 50% formula is not precise. Previous counsel has mentioned several things, but in addition, if you own your home the interest payments and tax payments will also have an impact on the calculation.",
        "Net income is the income left after deductions for mandatory expenses an mandatory deductions from one's pay. The formula you mentioned is the old formula for computing temporary spousal support but that can be superseded by a full blown analysis of Family Code Section 4320. Final spousal support cannot be computed by using a Dissomaster.",
        "Calculation by hand is not that easy, net income means you add back depreciation, and car payments and possible other debts being paid from the persons employment check."

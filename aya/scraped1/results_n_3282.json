Since then i paid it off and one company says it is a closed account paid in full. the other still says its an open debt. how do i go about getting this off my report it is had already been paid off? since it is no longer an account of theirs, why it is still \"open\" on my report.",

        "The company has a duty to update your credit report if they settled the debt.",
        "You have to dispute the debt with the credit bureaus.\n\nYou should also write a letter to the company claiming the debt an advise them that you paid the debt in full, and if you have proof of such, provide it to them.\n\nOnce you trigger the investigation with the credit bureaus they will contact both reporting agencies and request proof that the debt is still owed.\n\nThe triggering investigation may also trigger demand letters from either or both. If this happens you have to issues: (1) did the derogatory report coming from the errant agency constitute a violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act? If so, did you suffer damages in the form of higher interest rates or declined loans or credit? (2) if you receive dunning letters regarding this debt, and phone calls, will those constitute a violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act as well as the Rosenthal Act which is the state version?\n\nIf so, then you may have rights to demand damages.\n\nMr. Stempler's answer is otherwise correct and you may want to look at his sample letters.",
        "The free letters on my website, linked below, should be help, especially letter 3.1.

Include any proof that you have, even a copy of the final statement showing account closed or payment check that cleared showing settled in full.

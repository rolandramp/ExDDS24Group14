    "title": "Chapter 7 means test. Is irs $200 \"clunker\" deduction still available in the central district of CA. Ownership or operating line",
    "question": "I heard about the $200 deduction for cars 6 yrs or 75k miles. But I also read that after the Ransom case some courts have rejected it. Can someone tell me the policy in the Central District of CA allows for it. Also, is it added to the operating expense or the ownership expense line.?",

        "I absolutely agree that if you are having to deal with means test issues, you need to be represented by a competent bankruptcy attorney. Many of the issues that arise in determining eligibility, or in the context of Chapter 13 if you cannot file a 7, are not intuitive. The benefits of bankruptcy can be powerful tools in helping people resolve difficult financial issues. Do yourself a favor, look for an attorney who can help you.",
        "It goes on the operating expense line.",
        "When the Supreme Court took up the issue they did not overrule the lower court of appeals case on that issue. So in my district I use it and the US trustee or trustee has not and in my opinion cannot challenge it. I think it is good law in any district since Ransom since they did not reverse on that issue. A good lawyer is worth his weight in gold and if you need to go through the second part of the means test you need to have an attorney, and further if you don't get one you have a fool for a client so the cliche goes in representing yourself as your own attorney."

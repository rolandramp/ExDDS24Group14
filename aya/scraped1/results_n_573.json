        "Go see an attorney. What you think is separate and what is in fact separate could very well be different and the mistake could be cery costly. Do not proceed without attorney when assets are involved unless you are absolutely certain what will happen to them. Income earned during your partnership is community property. How the assets are titled, meaning whether one or both names appear on bank account, vehicle registration, real estate title is NOT determinative.",
        "In California, domestic partners and marital spouses are treated identically in the event only one of the partners or spouses files a bankruptcy proceeding. That was the determination made in the case of In re Cusimano, 2013 WL 9736597. I know, I was one of the attorneys who litigated that case to decision before the Santa Ana Division of the Central District of California.\n\nAs a result, the property that has been acquired since entering into the domestic partnership, if you and your partner have been domiciled in California, constitutes community property. When one domestic partner or marital spouse files any proceeding under the bankruptcy laws, not only does his/her interest in community property become property of the bankruptcy estate, but in fact 100% of the community property is included. This can, as quite a shock to the nonfiling partner or spouse, since community property can stand in the name of one domestic partner or spouse alone, yet still constitute community property if it was acquired during the term of the domestic partnership or marriage.\n\nThis is a complicated area of the law where principles of family law spillover into the bankruptcy arena. You should proceed with great caution and only after consulting with an attorney with expertise in both fields.",
        "If you are registered as domestic partners in California, any property purchased during he partnership is considered community property, so it all must be listed and protected in your bankruptcy. If she owned her home before the domestic partnership then her home will not be affected by your bankruptcy (assuming you are not on title to it, and never have been). If she purchased the home during the domestic partnership, however, that home is community property and you need to list it, even if you are not on title, and make sure the equity is protected through use of your exemptions, otherwise a chapter 7 trustee could liquidate it for the benefit of your creditors. I would recommend speaking to an experienced bankruptcy attorney and possibly retaining one to handle your case.",
        "This should not have any impact on her so long as all finances, credit, income, expenses, all property are truly separate."

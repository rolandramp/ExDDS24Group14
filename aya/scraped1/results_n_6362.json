        "You are still responsible for monthly HOA dues until your house is sold or transferred to a new owner--until the Trustee's sale date. If you stop the payment now, HOA may go after you personally. If you would like to stay in the house longer, save your credit and avoid further personal liability, short sale is an option that you should consider. Even, if you short sale your home, most lenders still will not allow to pay off your HOA past-due payments. Please note that once the lender serves on you a Notice of Trustee's sale, you only have 21 days from the auction date. If you would like to stay in your home longer, either keep or give up your home, wipe out personal taxes, if any, on the mortgage deficiency balance after the Trustee's sale, wipe out your HOA past dues and most of your debts, you should consult with an experienced attorney as soon as possible.",
        "You have to keep paying until the trustee's sale transfers ownership to someone else. In California, even though a house or condo which is part of a homeowners association (HOA) is sold at foreclosure, the owner at the time of the assessments is still personally liable for the HOA dues covering the period of time that such person was the owner.\n\nCalifornia Civil Code ยง1367.1(a) provides: \"A regular or special assessment and any late charges, reasonable fees and costs of collection, reasonable attorney's fees, if any, and interest, if any, as determined in accordance with Section 1366, shall be a debt of the owner of the separate interest at the time the assessment or other sums are levied.\"\n\nThe subsequent buyer of a property is not personally liable for the delinquent assessments of prior owners, pursuant to California Civil Code ยง1466.",
        "The obligation to stop paying dues often happens when you don't own the property. That could be a long time. A notice of default is only the beginning of the process."

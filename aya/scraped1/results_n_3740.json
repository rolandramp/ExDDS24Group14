    "title": "A judgment was entered against me back in 2006 by National Credit Acceptance (NCA) for a debt that is about 10 years old($1800).",
    "question": "I paid the amount down to $1000 but after 3 years, NCA was sued for bad practice and went out of business.

Is your current address corrected shown on the court records? In order to claim interest or post judgment court costs, the judgment creditor must file and serve a Memorandum of Costs After Judgment. If this document is served and filed (which is done by an attorney who is properly licensed to practice law in California and who has properly appeared as attorney of record in the action), you can file a \"Motion to Tax Costs\", and get a court hearing to determine the proper amount of interest and court costs.

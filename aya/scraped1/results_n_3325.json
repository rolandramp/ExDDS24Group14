        "The more the creditor knows they are pursuing a lost cause the more (for less) they are willing to settle. Letters from counsel can be effective. Depends on amount owed in determining cost effectiveness for you personally..",
        "You should write down all of the things that led to your financial hardship. You should also detail all of your income and all of your expenses. Be sure to mention each and every reason why paying the mortgage is very hard for you to do.",
        "There is not necessarily any stock language or bullet points you need to include. The state of your income is certainly a large factor. Other factors could include higher than normal expenses, such as medical bills, lack of good outlook for getting a better job, and the like. Your best bet is to take time to explain your whole situation as clearly as possible. I hope that is helpful."

    "title": "We received APPROVED Loan Modification papers from our lender, Notarized & returned. Now they don't acknowledge sending them?",
    "question": "In the past 4-5 years, I have twice lost my job. During those times, we applied for Loan Modification and Hardship help with my lender. The first unemployment (once I got another job), they said no to Loan modification and just added the missed payments to the end of my loan. This last time (last year) gave us a 6 month hardship forbearance. After that time period (and my new employment), we received ( Fed Ex) a letter and docs saying WE WERE APPROVED for a Loan Modification. We returned in Fed Ex supplied by lender. A few days before we received these Loan Docs, I was contemplating Bankruptcy (Chapter 7 -House NOT included). Once we received the Loan Mod, I knew I could afford house w Chapter 7. So filed. Lender acts now like APPROVED Loan Mod never sent. Want to foreclose. Help?",

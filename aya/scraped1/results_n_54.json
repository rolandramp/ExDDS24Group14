    "title": "Who can answer my questions regarding my role as a trust beneficiary in my deceased husband’s trust? I am not the Executor.",
    "question": "I am a beneficiary in my husband’s trust. I am also on the deed of the primary house we owned together. The trust states that 50% of the primary house is mine, with 25% going to each of our two adult children. Am I bound by the language in the trust? In other words does the house need to be sold? Or, can I keep the house to live in since my name and my now deceased husband’s name was on the deed as co-owner’s?",
    "answers": [
        "If the deed is joint tenancy, that’s what controls. You’ll need to get in touch with an attorney who can assist you.",
        "There is apparent conflict among deed and terms of trust.\nReview both documents with trust counsel to determine which controls, likely outcome.",
        "The trust terms will control your options. Use the Find a Lawyer tab and contact an attorney to have the trust reviewed and advise you about your rights and options. The deed should also be reviewed to see if the trust is a record owner. Best of luck.",
        "I agree with my colleagues. You need to retain a Trust/probate lawyer to review the documents and lay out your options for you.",
        "It appears as though there may be a conflict between the terms of the trust and the terms of the Deed. In order to sort this out, find/consult/hire a lawyer in your area using the Avvo feature \"Find a Lawyer\". Make a list of 4-5 having many 5 star reviews from satisfied clients. If you don't get a prompt call back from one, go on to the next on your list. Some offer a free consultation by phone or in person.\n\nGather together your documents (trust and recorded Deed) and show them to a Trusts lawyer in your area. Good luck and God bless."

    "title": "I'm supposed to release a lien on someone's property. Is it safe to give escrow an acknowledgment of satisfaction of judgment?",
    "question": "After winning a breach of contract case against a former business party, I placed a judgment lien on his property. He wants me to remove the lien before they sell the property and give us some of the money. He said his wife wants me to give a document titled \"acknowledgment of satisfaction of judgment\" directly to the escrow company. Does this sound right? I want to know that it's safe to provide the escrow company with this document especially because I don't trust this guy and I didn't receive any of the money yet!",
    "answers": [
        "That sounds pretty fishy to me. The lien is on the property, so that when he sells the property you get paid in escrow like any other lean such as the mortgages. Once you are paid, then the lien can be removed through a satisfaction of judgment. Escrow companies do this all the time. Deal with them only and make sure that you were going to be paid through the escrow. Get everything in writing.",
        "Be sure that you are dealing directly with the escrow company and not simply based on the word of your former business partner. Typically, a lien should not be removed until after you are paid. Once there is a potential buyer, be sure that your claim is placed into escrow so that you are paid directly out of escrow. Relying on your former business partner to pay you directly after the sale is not the best idea. Only after payment should there be a satisfaction of judgment entered. You should consult an attorney to review the documents to assure that you are paid from the sale.",
        "Banks holding the mortgage do this all the time with escrow companies, which is how the system works in California. If this is an abstract of judgment, then the escrow company should have sent you a letter asking for an agreed payoff of your judgment, in addition to a lien release. Deal with the escrow company directly or get help from your own lawyer.\n\nBy: Robert Stempler (Please see DISCLAIMER below)\nCONSUMER LAW OFFICE OF ROBERT STEMPLER\nA Professional Law Corporation",
        "Giving the acknowledgment to the title company is the normal way of doing things. I'm not sure if that's also the escrow company or not. You want to make sure that the agreement spells out that you are giving the acknowledgment in exchange for the promised amount so that if you don't end up getting the money, you can withdraw the acknowledgment. You can also give the acknowledgment to any of the attorneys involved in the closing, and the safest thing to do is be there at the closing to make sure you get the check. It all depends on your level of trust."

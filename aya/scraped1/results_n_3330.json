    "title": "Can I be sued without receiving a summons?",
    "question": "I received letter from collection agency this week claiming I have a judgment against me. This was a surprise to me since I have never been served a summons to attend any kind of court hearing. I looked up my name at the court indicated and it shows a judgment was made by \"default\". the summons shows that they served a \"jane doe\" occupant- 2 years ago. I have no idea where they served this summons. It clearly was not at my residence since it is in a completely different county.",

        "Both Mr. Stempler and Mr. Lysle give you excellent advice.\n\nThis seems to be an epidemic in recent years where process servers simply serve whomever they can find, and then claim they served the defendant; or worse yet, and this has also proven true, they serve no one, swear they did, and throw the papers in the garbage or down the sewer.\n\nThis has led to the terms \"Garbage\" and \"Sewer\" service. More and more states are requiring process servers describe the persons served, the specific time and place, and if there is a Jane or John Doe service of process, that instead they get the name of the person actually served or other description.\n\nThe typical thing is to move to set it aside and dismiss the case for improper service of process.

        "They absolutely can, and probably will, attempt to garnish your wages, levy your bank account and damage your credit. What you must do is to file a motion to vacate the default judgment on the grounds that you were never served and that you may have a valid defense to the action. There is authority holding that you must file such a motion promptly after you first learn of the judgment. You should retain an attorney to represent you in filing this motion because there are several possible statute grounds for such a motion and because you might have a right to sue the debt collector for violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. You need to have a knowledgeable lawyer \"set up\" the FDCPA lawsuit before filing.",
        "With people on the move so much in this challenging economy, the unfortunate answer is that not being served with a lawsuit, especially a debt collection lawsuit, has risen to epidemic proportions, perhaps more likely that a debtor will not be served with the lawsuit. The process server goes to the last known address and hands it to anyone who answers to door and looks age 18 or older, then a copy is regular US Mailed to the residence. Process servers are supposed to do more than that, but I have seen those proper steps rarely taken when serving debt collection lawsuits. Thus, after 30 days, the debt collection law firm asks the clerk of the court for a default judgment, due to the failure of the debtor to timely respond to the complaint in court. If the debtor calls the debt collection agency or law firm, the agency makes note of this and put in their notes that the debtor was aware of the lawsuit or served with the lawsuit, that way they can oppose a motion to set aside a default judgment later, if the debtor hires a debt collection DEFENSE lawyer to file a motion to set aside or the debtor tries to do it for her/himself.\n\nSee my blog at www.stopthecase.com on options, when learning of a default judgment entered against you without service. Take action, it is never too late to get a default judgment resolved, using one of the options in my blog postings. Don't delay, because delay will cause you to eliminate some of the better options, such as setting aside the default judgment, which should be filed reasonably soon, probably no more than 90 days from when you learned of the judgment. If you have wages, they can garnish them on an active judgment, even if by default.\n\nBy: Robert Stempler (please see DISCLAIMER below)\nCONSUMER LAW OFFICE OF ROBERT STEMPLER\nA Professional Law Corporation"

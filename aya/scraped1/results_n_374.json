    "question": "I have stopped paying my credit cards due to unforeseen circumstances and as soon as I can I will file for bankruptcy. Until then how do I stop getting collection notices?",
    "answers": [
        "Those notices will stop once you file bankruptcy. After the bankruptcy is filed and your creditors receive notice of your open bankruptcy case they have to go through your attorney's office and they cannot contract you directly. Bankruptcy can probably provide you great relief and erase most of your debts. I suggest you schedule an office appointment with one of us here on AVVO and we will be more than happy to help you file a bankruptcy case.",
        "Most attorneys allow bankruptcy payment plans. While you are making payments, you can refer all creditors to your lawyer. Your lawyer can also send cease and desist notices demanding they cease and desist contact with you. Once they verify representation, they will stop contacting you and go through your attorney for any communication. Keep in mind that creditors are still able to pursue their legal remedies (ie. Lawsuits) until the bankruptcy case is filed.",
        "You don't. The notices will continue including annoying phone calls. Remember, BK is more than checking boxes on forms you find online.

If you don't get a prompt call back from one, go on to the next on your list. Some of us offer a free consultation by phone or in person.

Don’t be limited by the location of the BK lawyers you select.",
        "You should engage counsel to represent you with regard to your debts. Under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, if you are represented by an attorney, collectors must direct all further communications to your attorney, and must see small for their efforts to communicate with you, family members and other third parties.\n\nIf you are intending to file a bankruptcy in any event, engaging councillor Leon may be the best way to stop the barrage of annoying and upsetting phone calls from creditors and collection agencies.",
        "May be difficult until the bankruptcy is filed with the court and creditors are notified. You can try sending them a letter of your intentions to file bankruptcy and this may result in fewer letters. If you have an attorney representing you, creditors would need to make contract with your attorney. However, letters may sitll go out."

    "title": "My children go to private school and my ex wife is to pay for it. She filed for BK, and did not put school debt on her Bk filing",
    "question": "My ex-wife fought for my children to go to private school. She agreed to pay for school. 2 months after court, she filed for bankruptcy. She owed money for the past school debt and current debt. She signed a contract with the school prior to filing BK but did not put any of the school debt on her bankruptcy. She paid for part of it but after she filed for BK, shouldn’t this be part of he Bk filing? I’m taking her back to court because I’m concerned about my children’s stability at school and it’s better my children go to public school. Will the judge question my ex about not putting the school debt on her filing? Will the judge likely be concerned she lied on her BK filing? Can the judge make her amend her Bk filing? Or will the judge say that her BK filing is not relevant in this case?",
    "answers": [
        "I don't think that your ex-wife's failure to list the private school tuition on the bankruptcy schedules is particularly relevant to your child custody issues in family court.",
        "The main thing to remember, here, is that her obligation to make the education payments are a form of child support and is not dischargeable in bankruptcy. If those payments were due and owing at the time of her BK, they should have been scheduled on her Schedule E as priority debts; but she will still owe the school.\nYour family court judge will likely not question her about her bankruptcy schedules because that would not be relevant to your request for an order allowing the children to go to public school."

    "question": "Hello I need some help on a question that I have I'm about to file Chapter 7 BK I have a vehicle that I got in a car accident about 2 years ago at the time of the accident my insurance overlapped and got stuck with the vehicle lender never came for it I requested for them to come and pick up the vehicle various times they told me they do not want it they just want me to pay what I owe on and it would be about $14,000 I have asked for pink slip at lien release I have gotten either once I file bankruptcy can I still keep the vehicle and will they release the pink slip to it for I could keep the vehicle after",

        "Filing bankruptcy does not get rid of the lien the finance company has on the vehicle. The bankruptcy will discharge your personal obligation, i.e. if they repossess the vehicle they can never sue you personally for the deficiency and garnish your wages or execute a bank levy. However, as long as they have the lien they have the right to repossess the vehicle. You could try a 722 redemption which would allow you to keep the vehicle for what it is worth, you can pay them what is owed, or you can just keep driving the vehicle until they repossess it. I hope this helps.",
        "If you want to keep the car for what it is worth, and not one penny more, you will need legal representation to pull off a redemption under 11 USC sec 722. I know of no redemption financing company that will finance you unless you have an attorney representing you. Don't think most experienced bankruptcy attorneys will step in to handle just this matter after you file without an attorney, because a pro se filer is a land mine and anyone with sense will send you packing or charge you double. Hope this perspective helps!",
        "You own the car, they have secured interest. Your options:\n1. Continue driving for free as long as you can forever. That is best, just park inside garage if\nneeded but know it is free driving too as long as possible!\n2. Keep car and rent it to a friend as long as you have insurance forever covering you.\n3. Tell creditor you will part it out if they don't repo it by a date certain and keep proof you did\nnotify them with address and ph number to pick up car so you are not sued for conversion. I\nwould think a week is long enough to pick it up. If not by then, part it out if feasible.\n4. Tell creditor you will leave it in their parking lot but then if towed you might be liable for\npost-petition fees incurred as our ownership still. But it might make them come repossess it\ninstead.\n5. MOST of the time, the car is worth less than is owed on it. You can offer bank to sell car and\nyou keep $500 or some $ and they get rest if they agree to it assuming you have no equity. What\nif they say yes? If so, find a buyer.\n6.

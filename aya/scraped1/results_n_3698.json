    "title": "What to do after my BK Ch.#13 was dismissed and all creditors are still asking for payment.",
    "question": "I filed a Ch #13 BK in Oct. 2011. After paying the Trustee for 1 year my employer furloughed me and I wasn't able to pay my monthly plan pymnt. I asked my attorney for help and they pretty much brushed me off - I ended up paying a different attorney $500 to submit a request to lower my payment but he just took my money and never did anything with my case. Therefore, the BK was dismissed in December 2012. I spoke to another Attorney for possible filing of Ch.#7 and he said my home's equity was more than the debt I wanted to discharge and more than likely court would make me sell my home - so he didn't recommend a Ch.#7 filing. So now I'm stuck and don't know what to do - my credit is shot and a lawsuit might be in the works. I need help and advise on what to do now. I feel lost.",

        "Attorney Larkin and the others have given you great answers.\n\nI am only writing to talk about the 2nd Chapter 13 attorney that took your $500 and did nothing. I could be wrong but when you say \"nothing\" I take that to mean that you paid the money and the lawyer did not go through with what you paid him to do.\n\nThe 2nd attorney should have either gone through with filing the application or motion to modify the plan, or at least tried for a hardship discharge for you. Alternatively you should've received your $500 back or a good chunk of it.\n\nThis is why people don't like to hire lawyers because they're afraid if they pay us, they may not get anything done for the money.\n\nIdeally all lawyers like to get paid to do nothing. Many people prefer to get paid to do nothing. But taking your bottom dollar is just not right.\n\nHave you ever requested a refund of that money? Or asked the court to disgorge it back to you? Is this lawyer sill practicing law? These are all good questions but it just galls me because its hard enough to get clients and having someone take a client's money for nothing ... well.",

        "I'd look closer at the value of the home...get an appraisal ASAP.\n\nUnderstand that you can't have your cake and eat it too; if you have too much equity and you file Chapter 7, the trustee will sell your home, pay off the mortgages and cost of sale, pay you $75k to $175k if you maximize your homestead exemption...and use the rest of the money to pay creditors and his fees.

        "As Attorney Larkin indicates, obtain a second opinion. If she is near employ her..her comments on AVVO reveal her knowledge of the law and accuracy of it.. so employ one for a second opinion. Call several real estate agents for a free market analysis first so you can obtain a more accurate value of the house even though you may not want to sell. However, If NOt all equity is protected, then options? The attorney may think of some: borrow again retirement account to pay trustee non exempt part. File ch 7 have them pay the homestead, downsize and buy a cheaper/smaller place and move on with your life! Because of the dismissal date you can file a bankruptcy anytime now. Good luck. I have even endorsed Attorney Larkin as she is an attorney who can guide you through this no matter what..so if close enough to drive to her office..DO SO>",
        "The issue is whether your home has nonexempt equity or not; if your home has nonexempt equity, Chapter 7 might not be a good idea. California has a very generous homestead exemption, so you should get a second opinion from another bankruptcy attorney before writing off the idea of bankruptcy altogether. And get your home appraised - websites like Zillow are not the most accurate way to determine your home's value."

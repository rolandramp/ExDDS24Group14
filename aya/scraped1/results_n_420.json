    "title": "Does filing a proof of claim in the defendant's bankruptcy case affect a motor vehicle personal injury case in Superior Court?",
    "question": "I am the Plaintiff in a personal injury motor vehicle case in Superior Court. The Defendant filed for bankruptcy instead of filing an answer. If I file a proof of claim in the defendant's bankruptcy case, does subjecting myself to the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court affect my ability to obtain a money judgment in the superior court case?",
    "answers": [
        "The short answer is yes. You need to find out if this lawsuit has any further reason to be litigated. There are exceptions to what can be discharged in a bankruptcy, but more than likely your claim against the debtor will be discharged. Only an attorney that is familiar with the fact of your situation can answer that question. You need the counsel of a lawyer. The time involved should be short. Call around and see what an attorney would charge you to review your situation, give you advice and file a proof of claim for you. Be warned, there is a time deadline on filing the proof of claim, so don't delay.\nGood luck.",
        "Yes. Claim now subject to jurisdiction in BK court.\nPI claim stayed.\nClaim may/not be discharged in BK proceeding.\nMore case specific information needed to further advise.",
        "Your chance for a money judgment went out the window when the defendant filed bankruptcy unless the defendant was operating the vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or drugs. Your remedy, if any, will be in bankruptcy court. See a bankruptcy attorney to file a claim.",
        "You have been placed on notice of the bankruptcy. You cannot proceed in Superior Court without permission from the bankruptcy court allowing you to do so. Filing a proof of claim is something different. Consult with a lawyer before proceeding or you may und up in front of a bankruptcy judge for violating a court order"

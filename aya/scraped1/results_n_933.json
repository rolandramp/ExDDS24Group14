    "title": "The child is now emancipated and graduated. Do I still have to make payments on previous medical bills that have not been paid?",
    "question": "In May 7, 2016, I received a medical bill from the Custodial parent for $360.00.. We each pay half equalling $180.00. I'm to pay directly to the Custodial parent. I'm to pay only half of the amount she has paid and she is to provide a receipt of payment. The Custodial parent provided a payment receipt for $160.00 out of the $360.00. I paid her half of the $160.00 that she showed payment for. The child has now emancipated on May 14 (19 yrs) and graduated from high school. On June 2, the Custodial parent sent me another receipt of payment on this same medical bill. Am I responsible for a payment she made after the child has emancipated and graduated from high school? Is the child now responsible for his medical debts that have not been paid for?",
    "answers": [
        "Your order is to pay 1/2 of all uncovered medical expenses for your child. The bill incurred prior to his graduation of high school for $360; therefore, you owe 1/2 of the total amount uncovered which is $180.00. She sent you the total bill. Your obligation at that time was to pay $180 regardless of what she paid. It doesn't change because your child is not out of high school. Good luck",
        "If the debt was incurred when your order made you responsible for sharing the debt, you have to pay. Your facts show you already acknowledged your responsibility for paying for this debt by paying your half of the $160. Do not try and play games with the rest of it. You could find yourself the subject of contempt, and not just by the court.",
        "You're interpreting the order too literally: the procedure was apparently done in January so the expense was incurred during a period for which the order was operative. While technically not a 'reimbursement' I don't think a judge would rule in your favor if you didn't pay it and your ex took you to court. On the other hand, you can roll the dice that she won't take you to court for $160.00. Your child is now responsible for expenses and he was probably 18 when he signed the paperwork but you were still under a court order, and if your child needs medical treatment, you might want to consider contributing."

    "title": "Profits from selling house while in Chapter 13, and moving abroad?",
    "question": "We are currently in Chapter 13, and looking to move abroad in the next year. It looks like we will be able to sell our house for more than we owe, but we would need that money for a down payment on a new house. I'm trying to find out if there's a way to do so without dismissing our Chapter 13, or if we need to dismiss the case, and then sell the house. Also, if we dismiss the case, obviously our debts come back, what resources do the creditors have to collect after we move abroad? We most likely would not move back here.",
    "answers": [
        "It appears that this situation is handled differently from district to district. In the Middle District of Georgia, the debtor must present a signed real estate sales contract to the court, along with the motion to sell the property. After the sale is approved by the court and the Chapter 13 Trustee, any sale proceeds realized in excess of the mortgage payoff and the debtors' joint exemption gets paid into the case. In many cases, depending on the realized sale value, the debtors' plans are paid out much earlier as a result of the sale of the reality.",
        "The question is one of timing and how much you will have in proceeds to reinvest. If you sell the house and immediately use those proceeds to purchase the new residence, you should be able to do so with court approval. If the proceeds are more than the value of your homestead exemption, you may need to amend your plan somewhat. The homestead proceeds need to be reinvested in real estate or you may end up losing them. Talk to your lawyer again and have him explain why the case has to be dismissed. It may be due to the homestead issue.",
        "You need not dismiss your case in order to accomplish what you want to do. You will need to file a motion to sell with the bankruptcy court, concurrent with a motion to incur indebtedness. You are not permitted to sell your home without the court's permission, and you must have its permission to purchase a new home. What you want to do is possible, but I recommend that you have an attorney help you.",
        "You would need to review this with your attorney of course. Here in Cleveland my clients would have me file action to sell assets with notice to creditors and the office of the chapter 13 trustee. What your asking for does not sound unreasonable but would need court approval."

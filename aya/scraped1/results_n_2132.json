    "title": "If a credit card bill has been charged off, can the Company send a 1099 for it?",
    "question": "I have had some hard financial times for awhile now, trying to get caught up. But, I haven't been able to pay anything extra, so one of my credit card companies charged off my bill, but has since sent me a 1099 for $2,000. Is this something new? Is this how that works now? Can they do this? Is this legal?",
    "answers": [
        "A 1099-C for Cancellation of Debt income is issued by the creditor to the debtor to indicate that the debtor received income for the amount of the debt cancelled. You received some value for the goods or services \"written off\", and therefore had the equivalent of the money. There are some circumstances, such as insolvency, when the debt income may be neutralized, however it still must be reported. YOu had best get yourself to an experienced tax professional so you file your tax return correctly.",
        "Forgiven debt is considered income by the IRS. FYI, debt discharged in bankruptcy is not considered income.",
        "This is par for the course. Debts that get written off (usually above $600) are often followed by a 1099-C being filed. You have to treat the write-off on the 1099 as income in your taxes. In other words, a debt that could be discharged in bankruptcy gets turned into a tax liability that could not be discharged in bankruptcy. One thing you might want to look into doing is filing an IRS Form 982 with your taxes asking that the $2,000 not be treated as income because you were insolvent at the time of the write-off. But as for your question, it is legal and common practice.",
        "There are 2 separate issues here:\n\nFirst, a \"charge off\" is only an accounting term. It simply means the creditor deems your account bad, typically after 6 months of missed payments. You still legally owe the debt in question, subject to the statute of limitations on the debt.\n\nSecond, a 1099-C is used when debt is \"cancelled\". This is when a creditor completely forgives a debt and you are no longer liable for it. When this happens, the amount is deemed to be income to you.\n\nYes, this is legal and very common. The 1099 adds the income to your total income for the tax year and you do your returns normally with all your deductions and credits.",
        "Yes. They must send you a 1099-C when they charge it off, which tells the IRS you have potentially that mount of income as forgiveness of income. When I say potentially, there are rules, e.g. amount of insolvency, which mitigate the amount you have to take into income. Look at section 108 of the Internal Revenue Code."

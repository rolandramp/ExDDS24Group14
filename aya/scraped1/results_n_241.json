        "My colleagues have provided good responses to your inquiry. If, in fact the warrant is not dischargeable in your bankruptcy case, you should be considering a payment arrangement with the \"extra\" money you said you have.",
        "More details are needed to give you useful information. The general rule is debts owed to the government are not dischargeable. To determine if your \"warrant\" issue and any fine/penalty fits any exception, you need to discuss this personally with a BK lawyer in your area.

If you don't get a prompt call back from one, go on to the next on your list.

It is not legal advice which requires much more information than the few facts you consider relevant."

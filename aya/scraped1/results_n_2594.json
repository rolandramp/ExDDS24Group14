    "title": "Does my ex husband get any of wrongful death settlement?",
    "question": "My morher was hit by a company car and now I am suing the company's insurance. This happend when my ex husband and I were legallyseparated. We are currently divorced and I did not list this settlement under an community asset. I have not received any money from the settlement either. I received an email from him stating that he wants a portion of the settlement from my mother. And he also mentioned how wrongful death is considered personal injury which in CA is community asset. Not sure how he found out. I am thinking about getting another lawyer for my mother/dropping lawsuit & then starting the lawsuit all over again with new lawyer. That way there is no way my ex spouse can possible be entitled to any money. Do you think that would be the right choice? Not sure what to do at this point.",

        "You have standing to assert a claim for the wrongful death of your mother. if your mother was married at the time, her spouse can sue, as can her estate, and any other children she had. it appears she died after you physically separated from your husband. I am not a family lawyer and haven't researched it. If you used community funds related to her death, like paying for her funeral, the community would have a right of reimbursement. Since she apparently died at the scene, I assume there really aren't any medical bills outstanding.\n\nWas your mother providing economic support to you before she passed? if not, you don't have economic losses, nor would the community. I also think since your husband and the community have no legal standing to assert a WD claim here, he and the community have no rights to any settlement you may get for the loss of the relationship you had with your mother. The fact that the accident occurred after you and your husband separated, is also very helpful to your position.\n\nA good family law atty should be able to defeat any claim your soon to be ex may assert. There are other facts that can come into play, so make full disclosure to the atty you are going to see. For example, if your mother had borrowed money from you and your husband while you were together, the community is a creditor of her estate, and could make a claim against the estate. Sometimes there is no estate opened, and no claim brought for the estate. Depending upon her assets, debts, will or trust, it may not be worth the cost to even open an estate and to have it make a claim. Depending upon facts, the estate might end up with some recovery, but the costs and fees eat into it, and then creditors take the rest. You may need to consult with a probate atty as well.\nGood luck.",

        "Attorney Boyer is correct. It is very unwise to play lawyer in a serious issue like an adversary proceeding. I recall a similar question earlier today. One of the purposes of conducting a Rule 2004 exam is precisely to use the results against you. You will be pitted against experienced lawyers who get paid to help their creditor/client win a non-dischargeability case against you. If they prevail, their debt will survive your discharge of other debts and a future BK will not erase the judgment they are likely to get now. Adversary/non-dischargeability matters are not pursued lightly. A creditor who loses such a case will be responsible to pay your attorney fees. Oh, I forgot, you won't have any attorney fees because you don't have an attorney.",
        "You are repeatedly asking questions about a Rule 2004 examination, and it is obvious that you have no idea about the reality of a Rule 2004 examination is and how the testimony can be used. Trying to represent yourself Pro Se in a Bankruptcy proceeding is extremely unwise. There is no way that you can possibly know the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, Local CA Bankruptcy Court Rules, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and case law, plus you are emotionally involved. You cannot \"hold your own\" against experienced Bankruptcy attorneys. Use AVVO's Find a Lawyer tool to select a qualified attorney. Good luck. THIS IS NOT LEGAL ADVICE! YOU NEED TO SPEAK TO AN ATTORNEY WHO IS LICENSED IN YOUR STATE FOR LEGAL ADVICE. This is merely suggestions for you to think about in discussing your situation with the local attorney."

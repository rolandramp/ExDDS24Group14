    "title": "Hello need advise please. Does a REPO hurt your chances of qualifying for a new auto loan post BK since the banks would see the?",
    "question": "I need a daily driver for work etc... I owe 13.5K on my current vehicle.. it’s worth maybe 9K & currently has 55K miles ..... It’s a 2018 Toyota so it will last me for years to come... however i wanted to start fresh off my BK filing but I also need a vehicle for work ... and I’m sure it will be very hard to get approved for a vehicle right after filing ( I plan to file next week ) should I just keep my current vehicle if I can afford the payments and to aggressively pay off the car sooner rather than surrender and run the risks of not qualifying for a car ( I can financially pay it off in 5 months if I plan and budget )",
    "answers": [
        "Yes, some calculations might show that you can save $5,000 if you give up the Toyota. However, you need to think long term. A 2018 Toyota will likely last you 10 years and 100,000 more miles if you take care of it. Buy a used $5-6,000 car with terms that are not very favorable and you might be buying problems that cost you more.",
        "I think the answer is based on your personal decision.",
        "One option not discussed by you or by my colleagues is to file a motion to redeem your current car to make a one time payment for the car's fair market value. Your attorney can do this while you're in your bankruptcy and can probably arrange financing through either bankruptcydrive.com or 722redemptionfunding.com. The interest rates these companies charge are pretty high (about 24%) but it may still be worth doing since you are about $4k upside down on your current car. You indicate your current car is a 2018 Toyota. As you are aware Toyotas are extremely reliable, so if you are otherwise happy with the car, I'd recommend keeping it rather than surrendering it, if you can redeem it at acceptable terms, especially if you'll have the wherewithal to pay off the loan in the next year.",

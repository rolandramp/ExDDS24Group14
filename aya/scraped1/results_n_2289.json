    "question": "If a manager or member buys out the ownership interest in LLC 1 FROM THE PREVIOUS MEMBER/MGR.,and renames it a different LLC or LLC2, does this mean it is a new LLC? Does the new successor in interest assume both debts and liabilities from the LLC 1?",
    "answers": [
        "Renaming does not make it a new entity. The same federal tax ID number stays with it no matter how often it changes its name. Change of ownership means change of Membership control. Since there is no LLC 2 there is no successor in interest issue.",
        "All your questions have multiple possible answers. There are many shades of gray on these terms.\n\nTake the papers and the details of the sale to an attorney for an in person assessment",
        "You are correctly concerned about successor liability. The fact that the manager bought out the previous owner, unless that transaction was structured and documented properly, could expose the \"new\" company to the liabilities of the previous company. If a new LLC was formed/created with a separate filing with the Secretary of State's office, then there could still be successor liability issues depending upon the terms of the sale agreement. You should consult with an attorney to review this matter before going further. A misstep can be financially ruinous."

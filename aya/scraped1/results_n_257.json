        "Your questions, unfortunately, is not detailed sufficiently to understand the status of the house and liens. As discussed by my colleagues, if you are just talking about selling the house after bankruptcy, that has a mortgage on it, then you are able to just sell. The mortgage lien remained on the property after the bankruptcy. If there is a lien on the property resulting from a judgment, and your bankruptcy attorney was unable or did not attempt to avoid the lien, then the house can be sold but it is subject to the mortgage and judgment lien (must be paid in order to close the sale). I urge you to consult with an experienced bankruptcy attorney to discuss all details of the issues and all of your options.",
        "Perhaps. More facts are needed to give you useful advice. If I make a few assumptions, it sounds like a creditor sued you before your BK, got a judgment and recorded a lien against your real estate. Your BK lawyer should have taken care of this during the time your case was opened. If you didn't use a lawyer in your BK, this is what happens to debtors who don't have the benefit of good representation. If you thought you could do this yourself and save money, it will now be time to pay an attorney to take care of this. If you still intend on doing this yourself, it is a very unwise decision. Here are the steps necessary to fix this:\n\n1. File a proper motion to reopen your case;\n2. If your motion to reopen is granted, prepare a proper order for the judge to sign;\n3. File a motion to avoid the judgment lien(s), assuming you don't have any surplus equity beyond what you exempted;\n4.

The BK judges don't like the extra time they must spend reading poorly drawn motions, detecting insufficient evidence, rejecting your paperwork for deficiencies, etc. This leads to the very likely outcome of dismissing your proceedings because the judge has too many other matters to resolve and won't take a lot of time fiddling around with pro se parties.",
        "Your bankruptcy discharged your personal liability on the debt but not the lien that had attached to your property. You will need to re-open your case and file a motion to avoid your lien, The rules to do this are very tricky. You will definitely need an experienced bankruptcy lawyer to help you."

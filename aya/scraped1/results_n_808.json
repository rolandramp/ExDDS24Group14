    "title": "Do incurable disabling illnesses that caused me to close my business help me with chapter 7 bankruptcy?",
    "question": "When a rare illness with multiple underlying incurable conditions caused me to become so ill that I could no longer work and therefore, close my business (sole proprietorship, dance studio). When it comes to filing chapter 7 bankruptcy, does the fact that disabling conditions caused my inability to work play any part in filing bankruptcy? (For example, are there certain parts of the application process, such as being excused from repaying a certain person or creditor, that are made easier/automatically \"forgiven\" with proper documentation of my disability?",

    "title": "Hi, I want to get a Summary Dissolution in California and satisfy all the requirements, but am confused about some things.",
    "question": "Some lawyers on this site have answered that individual student loans acquired during or before the marriage DO NOT count as Community Obligations yet the Sample Worksheet on Community Obligations includes \"College Debt.\" If it's not community obligations, do we include it in Separate Property and it cannot exceed $38k for each? Also, what if we don't have any community property? All of our bank accounts and credit cards were always separate. Do we include bank accounts and credit cards in separate property then and it too cannot contribute to exceeding $38k? If we say we have no property or debt to divide in our Property Agreement, do we still have to list the student loans and credit card debt in the Separate Property section?",
    "answers": [
        "California is a Community Property state. All property and all debt acquired AFTER marriage but BEFORE the date of separation are considered community property/debt and both parties would have a 1/2 interest in the property and the paying of the debt. All property and all debt acquired BEFORE the marriage but AFTER the date of separation is considered separate property/debt and only the person responsible for accumulating the debt would be required to pay it off.\n\nSummary dissolution is a unique way to get divorced in California. It requires the following: 1) the parties be married for less than 5 years; 2) no children born of the marriage; 3) no real estate owned; 4) community debts not exceed $6K; and 5) community property not exceed $38K.\nYou file the petition, wait 6 months and one day, and then the court mails you the divorce judgment. You never have to appear in court and show up in front of a judge. It's a faster, better way to get divorced.\n\nI wouldn't get wrapped around the axel about the sample worksheet included in the packet. If your bank accounts and credit cards were always kept separate, just state in the Property Settlement Agreement (PSA, that you attach to the petition, FL-800) that Husband agrees to pay the Visa card (last four of account) and Wife agrees to pay the MasterCard (last four of account), for example. Out of an abundance of caution, write that you are responsible for your own school loans and wife responsible for hers. If you have no community property to divide, you can list the college debt in the separate property of the PSA, so the later on no party can dispute who is responsible for what.\n\nBest of luck to you.",

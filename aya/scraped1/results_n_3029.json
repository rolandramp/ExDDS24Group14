    "title": "Discharged chapter 7 two yrs ago. Didn't reaffirm condo. Bank taking judicial action 2 fix problem on title. responsible for leg",
    "question": "The condo was a rental and I had hoped to keep it. However, I did not reaffirm on it. Now I am losing it. It turns out that there was a problem on the the title. So, they can't do a simple foreclosure. I guess it wasn't properly recorded. Now they are taking legal action to force me to sign a deed of trust. I think they will foreclose thereafter. The Wells Fargo attorney is saying that I will owe the legal fees from the action. IS THIS TRUE? considering that I discharged the debt in a chapter 7 2 years ago?",
    "answers": [
        "I would consult with a real estate attorney before doing anything. Your personal liability on the debt has been discharged, and the mortgage company has no right to any real property deficiency.",
        "Agree with colleagues. To your advantage that you did not reaffirm. Your BK discharge relieved you of personal liability. Do not sign new deed of trust to fix WFB mistake until you review with BK counsel. I do not believe you will be liable for legal fees caused by WFB mistake and measures taken to fix it. WFB may be liable for damages because they are violating the BK stay. Consult BK counsel immediately.",
        "I agree with other counsel that you should not owe fees for fixing their mistake. I would contact your bankruptcy counsel-- or if you didn't have one, bankruptcy counsel familiar with real estate transactions --and see if recordation problem means that you have a defense to their action, which might belong to your chapter 7 estate. Act quickly.",
        "Even in the absence of a bankruptcy discharge, the filing of a quiet title action (assuming that is what you are dealing with) by the lender to correct a title issue does not result in the borrower's having to pay the lender's fees associated with such an action unless the borrower created the problem. And nobody - not even a court - can force you to sign a deed of trust against your will. The court can has the power to modify and cancel real estate instruments, but it can't make you sign a deed of trust. The bankruptcy discharge prevents the lender from charging you for legal fees under the promissory note and deed of trust. Talk to an attorney.",
        "I agree that you should not sign anything and you should consult with an attorney ASAP. You mentioned that the creditor's attorney is saying that you owe them money for attorney fees. I am not sure exactly what they are asking for in the lawsuit, but if they are asking for monetary damages against you (as opposed to the other non monetary reliefs), it may be considered as a violation of your bankruptcy discharge. If the creditor actually violate the discharge, you may be entitle to bring an action against the creditor for violation of the discharge in bankruptcy court. Please consult with a qualified bankruptcy/real estate attorney ASAP.",
        "I agree with Mr. Granvold and Mr. Primus: you need to see an attorney. I think they may be able to correct the problems with the Deed of Trust, though depending on what was wrong, maybe not. I do not think that you can be held responsible for their attorney's fees because of your prior bankruptcy and you may well be able to use that assertion to get the bk court to sanction them for attempting to collect a discharged debt. See an attorney.",
        "Don't sign anything without consulting legal counsel.",
        "You need to see a lawyer ASAP and go over what the lender wants you to sign. The rules are strict and the bank might have a problem.",
        "YOu will never owe any fees from creditor foreclosing..it is a violation of law for attorney to say so! But if you have any HOA dues post bankruptcy filing till not in your name you will be liable on those you should know. It is great you did NOT reaffirm..and hence..the fact you owe no fees!"

    "answers": [
        "It is permissible for an attorney to charge reasonable fees for additional work beyond the scope of representation as described in your attorney client fee agreement. I'm assuming this is the debtor's (your) attorney. I generally do not advise, nor sign off on, reaffirmation agreements for debtors, as it is practically never in the debtors best interest to agree to pay a debt, which would otherwise be discharged in the bankruptcy they just filed.",
        "Yes, it is totally normal. In fact, that is a pretty standard rate. There are some lawyers who will not prepare and certify these reaffirmation agreements because once submitted and approved by the assigned judge, you are obligating yourself to pay this debt and cannot be discharge in the instant Chapter 7 case. If there is a significant difference between your Schedule I and Schedule J, making the difference between the two negative, you are likely to have a judge disapprove of your request to reaffirm your car at your reaffirmation hearing. This is because requesting a reaffirmation under these circumstance creates a presumption of hardship. However, some judges take the position that you are a grown-up and should understand the consequences of reaffirming a car loan if fully explained to you. If you filed in \"pro se,\" the judge would have the task of explaining to you exactly that.\nGood Luck.\n***This is just general legal information, not advice specific to you in your case.

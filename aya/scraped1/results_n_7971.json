    "title": "Notice of Levy- Under writ of Execution (Money Judgment)",
    "question": "I received a Notice of Levy today in the mail for some credit card debts 2.5 years ago. I'm self-employed so they can't garnish my wage, but I'm concerned about my bank account. I had changed my bank account already 2 times, I don't have a lot of money, and I live from paycheck to paycheck.",
    "answers": [
        "If they locate your bank account, they can levy it - but the monies frozen will be released back if you eventually file bankruptcy timely.\n\nBK does not cost much - save the money in cash and then file BK ASAP to get a fresh start.",
        "You should be aware that when creditors can't find your bank account to attach, they may apply to the Court for an order requiring you to testify about where your property is located. No \"right to remain silent\" as to a collection case - you have to answer honestly!\n\nInstead of using your bank account to deposit the money you are saving, why not hire a bankruptcy attorney now and make the payments directly to him/her. Clearly it is in your best interests to file your case now rather than later.\n\nHope this perspective helps!",
        "Yes, if the judgment creditor can locate any of your bank accounts, the judgment creditor can levy on that bank account.\n\nNote that the judgment debtor can also take a judgment debtor examination (ORAP), wherein you must answer under oath where you keep your money, as well as any other assets."

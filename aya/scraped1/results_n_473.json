        "The best way to know what to expect is for you to have a personal meeting with a bankruptcy lawyer. It could be that you are worried for nothing. Let's hope so.",
        "My colleague is correct that the amount of the homestead exemption for your father would be $175,000, were he to be the one seeking to invoke the protections of the homestead laws. But if you are not claiming a head of household status or married, your portion of the property would be subject to the $75,000 homestead exemption.\n\nBefore embarking on a plan to file bankruptcy based on the assumption that the property will not be at risk, including your father's interest, you would be well advised to not only confer with qualified bankruptcy counsel, but to obtain an appraisal of the property by a qualified appraiser who has prior experience testifying as an expert witness. Your claim to the homestead is not a claim so much in the real property, as it is to $75,000 of equity that would result from liquidation of the homestead by sale. That can only be calculated based upon a firm and reliable determination of value.",
        "First of all, you must understand that you only own half of the property (since the joint owner is not your spouse). If you are unable to exempt your half of the equity the trustee has the power to sell the property to pay creditors from the proceeds; but he will first half to pay your father his half and pay you your exemption amount (75k unless you have other family members living with you) before any distribution to creditors. So if the equity in the house is under $200,000, you are probably OK to file ... but you MUST consult with a local BK attorney before proceeding.\n\nAlso, your father is entitled to a 175k exemption (not 100k) due to his age; but since he is not filing BK, it doesn't matter because his half will not be part of the BK estate and does not need to be exempted."

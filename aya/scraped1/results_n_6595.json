Do you have a CPA and/or lawyer to do \"due diligence\" and what debts may be outstanding, the status of the taxes, leases, etc. A template won't be enough.

        "If you are going to be a 51% investor, you are really the \"owner\". You should retain an attorney to handle this for you as setting up, running, and operating a restaurant is complex. I have set up the business, business plan, etc for restaurants in the East Bay. The ones with investors were the most difficult because even the smallest investor wanted to call the shots. Also, if you are 51% investors, you are the one the taxing authorities are going to pursue, individually, if the restaurant fails. I hope yours is successful, but the restaurant business is tricky so its best to be prepared.",

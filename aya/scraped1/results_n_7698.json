    "title": "Worker compensation lump-sum settlement in CA. How is this effect chapter 7?",
    "question": "I received a worker's compensation lump-sum settlement 6 months ago in the amount of $30k. Now I am going to file for chapter 7 bankruptcy and I need to know about chapter 7 bankruptcy exemptions. How much of my lump-sum can I keep due to bankruptcy exemptions?",
    "answers": [
        "My colleague pointed to what are the 704 bankruptcy exemptions and what's exempt under that. Seems the entire amount of the payment is exempt. However, more important is not how much you received but rather how much you have remaining (this is what you would generally exempt since you arguably spent some of the money).\n\nYou may be better off using the 703 bankruptcy exemptions if the amount has diminished, you have no home equity and have other assets that wouldn't otherwise be exempt under the 704 bankruptcy exemptions that could be exempt under the 703 \"wildcard\" exemption - including some or all of the remaining amount from the workers comp settlement.",
        "I would invite a California attorney to chime in, but my understanding is that workers comp. lump-sum benefits are 100% exempt (reference link below). There may be issues, however, with commingling with other funds that could make the nature of the benefit change and thus you stand to lose your possible bankruptcy exemptions. You should seek counsel from a local attorney for more specific guidance.",
        "Two points.\n\nOne, California has two bankruptcy exemption schemes, and you may only pick one. Section 704 specifically allows for workers compensation. The problem with Section 704 is that it is not very flexible with regard to other assets such as vehicles, bank accounts, etc. Section 703 does not have a specific bankruptcy exemption for workers compensation - therefore, you would use the \"wildcard\" exemption which is a catch-all for other non-specified assets, and that will cap you out at about $23,000, and that is assuming you don't have other assets that need to be exempted using the wildcard.\n\nThe bigger problem you might have is that you received the funds six months ago, which begs the question of where are they? Do you still have the funds, or were those spent? Were they put into a separate account, so that they are easily traced? That is a big issue.\n\nAs you can see, this is not a question that is readily answered without knowing more information, such as that I've touched upon above. You should probably consult with an experienced bankruptcy attorney to make sure you protect everything to the fullest extent possible and getting all your bankruptcy exemptions. Feel free to give me a call if you wanted to discuss it further.\n\nTodd Mannis, Esq.\nTel: (818) 591-9890",
        "As one of the posters alluded to, the issue here is probably one of tracing. You've already received the settlement, so the burden is on you to prove that whatever you are exempting is actually the proceeds from the workers comp. settlement. If you placed the funds in a segregated bank account and haven't used any of it, then it's easy. If not, it gets more difficult.\n\nUsing CCP 704.160 as the bankruptcy exemption, you can protect 100% of the award (less any domestic support obligation judgments against you), but as I mentioned, you have to prove that it is the actual award and not other funds that have been commingled.\n\nFailing that, you can always use the wildcard exemption in CCP 703.140(b)(5) up to around $20,000.\n\nMark J.

    "title": "What is an average attorney's fee for chapter 7? If I can pay $250 every 2 weeks, would a good lawyer take my case?",
    "question": "I owe about $50k, including back taxes from 9 years ago and medical bills. I still need to file 2011 tax of $10k in income. IRS owe me some money on that one. My income shrunk to $10k per year, because of my illness. I have a SSDI hearing coming up on end of this month and I would like to keep some of the money. I can pay $250 every 2 weeks for attorney's fee and any other fees that I incur. Would anyone like to be my lawyer?",
    "answers": [
        "The fees in Riverside and San Bernardino Counties are usually around $1000 if you don't have a house, maybe $1600 if you do have a house. I live in Riverside County, and I think that's in the ballpark or maybe a little lower than the average. Nobody will be able to file your petition until its paid in full, but most of us in this area will take payment plans and take calls from your creditors while you finish paying. If you don't have a judgment on anything, this should be a workable solution.\n\nYour tax debt may or may not be dischargeable. You could do a Chapter 13 to pay the taxes back if they can't be discharged. You will definitely need some advise on whether to handle the taxes in a Chapter 13 or a Chapter 7.",
        "I generally agree with my colleagues' comments. I write only to point out that no Chapter 7 bankruptcy attorney will file now and agree to accept payments later because the fees owed to your attorney will be discharged by your BK. You will need to have your total fee, plus costs, paid prior to filing.\n\nStill, finding an attorney now who can review all the necessary facts and begin to work on your petition and schedules is a VERY good idea. A little pre-bankruptcy planning now can go a long way to obtaining the relief you seek. Unless you are under the gun, and it appears you are not, waiting to file until your exact circumstances are known is probably a good idea, anyway.\n\nThe level of service provided by BK attorneys varies widely. In the Central District many attorneys and law firms use “appearance attorneys” for the 341a meeting. Seldom do these attorneys know anything about the nuts and bolts of your case and they are unable to assist you in answering the Chapter trustee’s questions. This frequently results in another appearance. In one 341a meeting I attended awhile back, my client was the only debtor who did not have the hearing continued and we were, unfortunately, at the end of the list.\n\nHigh on your list of questions should be whether your attorney, or an appearance attorney, will appear with you at the 341a meeting. If your attorney will personally appear with you, you can expect fees charged by that attorney to be higher for the increased level of service. Good luck.",
        "We'd need to obtain a copy of your tax transcripts to see how much, if any, of the income tax liability can be \"discharged\" or wiped out in Chapter 7 versus Chapter 13. The ranges of fees quoted by other attorneys described herein are accurate but if you want a specific quote, you need to take 20 minutes to provide greater detail to your potential counsel.\n\nMany of us will speak to you for free. Set up an appointment with an experienced BK attorney.",
        "Take additional time to talk to a few bankruptcy attorneys about the details of your case and all facts and transactions that may impact the complexity of advising you, preparing, filing and seeing your case through to completion. Fees may be paid in installments, depending on your choice of lawyer and the agreement reached between you and your lawyer. $250/payment for 6-8 payments may be in the ballpark - complex cases may require more. Until you have direct contact there is really no way to accurately quote a fee, and any law firm doing so should be met with further questions by you and at least a touch of skepticism or concern. You want to choose a competent representative, one who is thorough and understands the specific nuances of bankruptcy law (rather than inexperience or a generalist whom draws business with bottom-dollar fees yet may possibly expose clients for lack of experience, etc.)",
        "The attorney fees for chapter 7 vary based on many factors. That said, your request is more than reasonable. I'd be glad to speak to you. BTW - Social security is protected in bankruptcy so you do not need to worry about having it taken to satisfy debts.",
        "Attorney's fees for a Chapter 7 depend a lot on the area you live in and the complexity of the case. I have seen as low as $1000 and as much as $2500, or more, for some cases. Most consumer bankruptcy attorneys will accept payments but will require that the entire fee be paid prior to filing. Attorneys are treated just like credit cards and any money owed to the attorney at the time of filing will also be discharged. When you speak with a prospective attorney, make sure you discuss the total cost. Some attorneys routinely quote only the attorney fee portion of the cost. You also need to factor in the cost of obtaining a credit report, a credit counseling certificate and the filing fees, which will be going up next month. There are many excellent bankruptcy attorneys in CA. You should have no trouble finding one who will work with you on the payments.",
        "Attorneys fees in a chapter 7 vary widely depending on location, experience and skill of the attorney, and market rates generally. Average fees in your area range from between around $1000 to$1800 for a chapter 7, plus the court filing fee. Most attorneys will file the case after all the fees have been paid, so it would be in several months after your proposed payment plan is completed. But I wouldnt see an issue with getting an attorney on those terms.\n\nYou will want to hire a good attorney that understands taxes well and the dischargeability rules. There are a lot of angles to discharging taxes, and a lot of issues that might come up to make them nondischargeable (for instance, recent assessments by the IRS or liens filed by the IRS making the taxes secured). Often times, filing a few weeks later might discharge the taxes whereas otherwise you will be stuck with them for the next eight years. So it's always important to do your research when approaching a case such as this.\n\nGood luck!",

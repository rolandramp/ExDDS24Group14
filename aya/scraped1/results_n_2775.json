    "title": "Unable to remove a DMV hold on my California driver's license due to Vehicle Code 23538B",
    "question": "In 2009 I was arrested for a DUI in San Diego and pled guilty to it after returning from deployment in August 2010. When arrested, I blew a 0.21, which resulted in a VC 23538B being placed on my record. Two months after pleading, I was discharged from the Navy and began working for a company in MD, at which point I tried to get my Md State license but was told I had a block on my license in California. I submitted the DMV out of state 1650 waiver form to remove the block but was denied due to this particular vehicle code on my DMV record. I had my previous lawyer working on it the last 13 months and just found out there is nothing that can be done besides moving back to California and completing the 18mo program. What other REASONABLE options are out there besides writing the governor?",

        "This is a problem that comes up when an individual who is a resident and licensed to drive in another state gets a DUI in California. It sounds like you were ordered to enroll in and complete a DUI class in California as part of your probation terms. Unless the court stays the requirement to enroll and complete the class, DMV assumes that it cannot comply with the 1650 waiver since there is a separate imposition of the requirement by the court pursuant to VC 23538 (b). For out of state residents or licensees, experienced DUI attorneys will ask the court to stay the requirement unless the individual becomes a resident of California during the probation term so that the individual can wait out the suspension period, get a SR22, and then have the 1650 waiver granted. As others have stated, writing the governor will not make any difference.",
        "You used the word \"deployment\". Was you an active duty at that time? If combat duty or getting ready for combat? If the answer is yes, then you may have very safe grounds to contest this issue with DMV. DMV would not fuss with you when facging a federal issue. Even if you were few days after that would be fine. You may possibly be covered under the Servicemen Relief Act. Tell your attorney to probe under this ACT and possibly find you relief. I had successfully used in cases like stuent debts and foreclosure reversal for my clients who were \"deployed\". Now, remember \"depoloyment\" has a very serious definition. Were you discharged from the Navy as a \"honorable\" discharge? I am sure a competent attorney can help you. This SCRA has wider implications than one can believe.",
        "Something is not adding up here....might want to get a second opinion from another attorney after gathering ALL the facts for them to review.",
        "I agree with my colleague Mr. Finnecy. Other than the 1650 all that should be required is the SR22. I suggest you call him should you need more details. He is local to you and located in Vista, CA.",
        "Something doesn't add up here. Writing the governor, will not help. Have you filed an SR-22? Other than the 1650 waiver--if accepted---only an SR-22 should be required.",
        "You should find an attorney who can assist you, trying to handle these things on your own is often time consuming and ultimately ends up costing you more money and time. Get a lawyer!"

        "You are right to be asking questions, and as others have already mentioned, please have your parents speak to an estate planning attorney before signing over the property. There are many, many issues they, and you, need to be aware of before making this decision, and so many parents have come to regret signing a deed before receiving the right legal advice.\n\nThey should receive an attorney's advice and tell the attorney the goals they are trying to achieve by transferring the home to you, so the attorney can determine if a deed transfer now is the best way to accomplish their goals, or if another method would be more favorable to them, and to you. The future plans your parents have for the home would also need to be carefully considered by the attorney.\n\nThere are capital gains tax issues, property tax issues, and as you mentioned, income tax issues, plus potential gift/estate tax issues involved in the transfer, and a transfer to you now may not be the best way for you to receive the home in terms of all the tax ramifications to you. California also has community property laws which could affect the timing of the transfer as well.\n\nIf a transfer to you now is still determined to be the best option, there are also several different trust vehicles that could be used to provide asset protection and other benefits to you, that are far superior to simply signing a deed for the property over to you.

        "Remember that when you gift assets, there is a carry-over basis. This means that if Mom and Dad gift you a house they bought for $10,000 that is worth $100,000 and then you go to sell it in a few years for $150,000, you owe capital gains tax on the full appreciation ($150,000-$10,000=$140,000).\n\nThere are tax breaks in the Internal Revenue Code. Section 121 excludes capital gains if the house being sold is your primary residence (you have lived there 2 of the last 5 years) up to $250,000 for individuals and up to $500,000 for married couples.\n\nAdditionally, if your parents pass the house to you through the estate of the second to die, you get a full step-up in basis to the date of death value.\n\nI would contact a local attorney about a transfer with retained life estate deed from your parents to you and see if that is suitable for your needs."

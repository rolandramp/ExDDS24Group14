    "title": "What do I do after I asked for a validation of debt owed?",
    "question": "So I got mailed by a law collection firm trying to collect on a debt, I asked for a validation or proof that I owed it and they basically sent me photo copies of of the statements that went over due. Now I don’t know what to do because they didn’t tell me anything else that was significant. I want to know where I can go from here? Should I contact them and set up a payment plan? I don’t have a job or any assets or money really I’m barely about to start a job , what can I do?",

        "You should get an Avvo lawyer to look over the papers you got from the collection agency. Maybe enforcing the debt is beyond the Statute of Limitations and you won't have to pay it or make any arrangements. Find/consult/hire a lawyer using the Avvo feature \"Find a Lawyer\". Make a list of 4-5 having many 5 star reviews from satisfied clients. If you don't get a prompt call back from one, go on to the next on your list. Some offer a free consultation by phone or in person. Take us up on it.",
        "First of all, good for you for asking for validation of the debt before assuming that they're entitled to collect it. Not enough folks assert this important right.\n\nSecond, once a debt collector has \"validated\" the debt, they're free to continue collection efforts (still complying with other laws as well, of course). So I think the first question you need to ask yourself, and more importantly, an attorney, is whether you agree the debt is valid or not. Are these statements you mentioned actually for things you didn't pay for? Maybe they're really old, as Attorney Firth pointed out, and may not be collectible. In other words, maybe you need to keep disputing the validity of the debt with the creditor. Maybe not.\n\nNext, many bankruptcy attorneys offer a free consultation. If you pursue this, they may (can't promise for anyone else) be able to take a peek at the statements, and most importantly, review your overall financial situation and long-term goals to give you some ideas about what you should consider going forward. Too hard to say whether bankruptcy makes sense without a much more thorough discussion, so don't worry too much about it right now.\n\nAgain, good for you for asserting your rights. If you're conscientious enough to take that step, I'm optimistic that you're going to do the right things going forward. Good luck!!",
        "More information needed. How old is the alleged debt? If it is over four years old the statue of limitations has run, and the collection agency cannot successfully sue you. If the debt is valid, consult with a bankruptcy attorney to review your options. Most give free consults."

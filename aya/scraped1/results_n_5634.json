        "You need to consult with a probate and trust attorney who can advise you of the property tax implications of what you are attempting to do. If B purchases the home from A&C with his own funds then the two-thirds of the property will be reasssed for property tax purposes. The parent- child exclusion does not apply to transfers between siblings. There are ways to accomplish this in the trust as long as the trust doesn't require pro rata distributions. Usually a trust allows non-pro rata distributions (that's good), but I have seen trusts that require pro rata distributions. The Trustee (as trustee) will need to borrow money against the residence equal to the two thirds buy-out price (it can be difficult to find a lender willing to do this) and then the cash borrowed will be distributed to A&C and B will take the property subject to the liability. This is a very simplified explanation of what needs to be done. I strongly urge you to consult with an attorney before you take actions that will have adverse property tax consequences. This is NOT something to do on your own.",
        "My first point of advice is that you should seek local counsel who has experience in estates and trusts. A Probate Code Section 16502 Notice and Consent should allow a distribution in accord with the beneficiaries' wishes if all beneficiaries consent. Probate Code 16501(d) lists certain actions for which the notice may not be used.\nAs to tax effects, I assume that the assets at issue have a stepped up basis. Your counsel will need to look at this. Experienced trusts and estates counsel will be able to assist you on a number of your issues."

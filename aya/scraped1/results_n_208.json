    "title": "Would judgements against me, for lawyer fees and sanctions, be covered in a chapter 7 bankruptcy?",
    "question": "My divorce started with me filing a TRO. At the final hearing, the judge found that my ex had busted the door frame and put holes in our walls, but did not grant the TRO stating we were both at fault. My ex continued to drag out our divorce and custody, so that a new judge took over our case. During our divorce hearing, splitting bills and such, the new judge ordered I pay his lawyer fees for the cost of the TRO, payable to his attorney. I was also ordered to by the DCSS judge to pay sanctions on a set aside motion I filed to reverse what my then lawyer agreed to without my consent. My ex brings home $15-20 thousand a month and I take home maybe $1400 and the support for our two kids $468 a month from him. I cannot afford the $20,000, let alone all my other bills, so I have to file a BK. Can I include those judgements?",

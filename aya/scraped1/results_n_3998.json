        "Reaffirming a mortgage is usually a very bad idea because it creates personal liability on a debt that would otherwise be discharged in your bankruptcy. In a state like California where we have both judicial and non-judicial foreclosure sales, this means if the mortgage lender later does a judicial foreclosure sale they can come after you (in some situations) for the deficiency after the sale. Not signing the reaffirmation agreement ensures you can't later be held liable for a deficiency. So what if they don't report your timely payments on your credit report - you can do that yourself - you don't need them to do it for you. I will also add that many judges here in California will deny a reaffirmation agreement on a mortgage. That said, you should still consult with your own attorney because there are some rare exceptions when it might be a good idea to reaffirm. I doubt that is the case for you but it could be and without a full analysis of your situation by an experienced bankruptcy attorney, you won't know.",
        "Yes, you can reaffirm a mortgage loan, as long as the creditor agrees. The advantage of signing is that the bank will deal with you and recognize you as the mortgagee. This can have benefits later if you decide to refinance, as the bank already told you. Most attorneys will not advice you to reaffirm because there are also many disadvantages to reaffirming a mortgage. If you should default in the future after reaffirming, you will be liable for the debt and they can come after you. Therefore, most attorneys will tell you not to reaffirm and to just keep making the payments. You can always get a copy of your payments later to show the credit bureaus, if that becomes a consideration.",
        "Attorney Larkin and Attorney Bunce carefully explain the answer to your question. However, my question is you do not state if you have only one or two mortgages. If two and if the value exceeds both..sometimes I try to see if the second mortgage will agree in a ch 7 to reduce the principal , monthly payment and interest rate to terms that you like. If so, knowing the risks as the other attorneys point out, that would be one of the few times I may agree and recommend a reaffirmation..but have only done about 3 of those in my 27 years..so don't hold your breath..but they cannot say yes if you don't ask! (or say no).",
        "In general, I urge my clients NOT to reaffirm their mortgages. Reaffirming only continues the dsbtor's personal liability for the note, which is why the debtor is in bankruptcy in the first place. The downside is that some lenders won't report the status of the loan to a debtor's credit report, but in my opinion, that's a small issue.\n\nPLEASE consult with an attorney about this - this is only general advice, and not specific to your situation.",
        "We must see this question at least 5 times a day. It is your choice to reaffirm or not but lawyers and the majority of bankruptcy judges agree it is not in your best interests. Yes, the mortgage company will no longer post your payments on your credit report, but so what! You can obtain an account history from them at any time to show any prospective lender your credit worthiness and there are plenty of other things to do to increase your FICO score. I published a 10 part series on this topic under my legal guides & you are welcome to peruse the list to find the ones that interest you. The big down side to reaffirming is that you may be responsible if there is a deficiency if your property later forecloses, and the chances of this happening cannot be predicted. Hope this perspective helps!"

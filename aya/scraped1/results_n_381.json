    "question": "I was going to consult with a real estates attorney regarding this matter on my a defaulted 2nd mortgage loan lien placed on my home in 2005. I was told i needed a debt attorney. Does anyone have any advice",
    "answers": [
        "as indicated, a Chapter 13 would work. That being said, if you want to avoid going that route, you may be able to negotiate the debt and get the lien removed. You may need to have some assistance with that.",
        "Start off by consulting with a bankruptcy lawyer. Most offer a free consultation.",
        "A Chapter 13 bankruptcy case might provide you with one avenue for eliminating a junior lien from your title. You would need to meet the conditions for a lien strip. To eliminate the 2nd in this way, the fair market value of the home needs to be less than the amount owing on the 1st deed of trust. If there is even a single dollar of equity in the home to support the 2nd, you cannot strip the lien.\n\nAnother way to eliminate the 2nd lien would be to come to an agreement with the holder of the note. Some sort of payment is required here, but it is possible that the holder would take less than the full amount of the note and give you a release.\n\nMost bankruptcy/debt attorneys should be able to discuss this with you.",
        "One way to do it is, If the value of the house and land is less than the amount owed on the first lien, the 2d can be avoided or \"stripped\" in a chapter 13 bankruptcy. The property value and amount owed on the first lien is as of the date that the petition under chapter 13 is filed.",
        "Well, you might be able to remove the 2nd mortgage in a chapter 13 bankruptcy proceeding. You would need to make sure the fair market value of the property is less than what is owed on the 1st mortgage. If that is the case, you can file a motion to avoid the lien and then the lien becomes unsecured debt to be paid along with your other unsecured creditors in your chapter 13 plan. You will need to speak to some experienced chapter 13 attorneys to get an estimate of what your plan payment would look like based on your assets you own and your household income. Outside of bankruptcy, you can try negotiation with the 2nd lienholder to see if they would accept a lump sum settlement payment in exchange fro them removing the lien."

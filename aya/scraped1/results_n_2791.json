    "question": "Hi, I want to get legally separated from my spouse. I don't want to sell the house that we bought together during our marriage. In case, any one of us wants to proceed with divorce, then I am willing to sell the house or buy the other spouse out? Is it possible to hold the property till we actually decide to divorce?",
    "answers": [
        "A legal separation will require you to also divide the house as well as all other assets and debts. But the legal separation could contain a clause on retention, occupancy ,etc and then when the house will be sold with the percentage of division being spelled out in the agreement. Seek legal assistance from a family law attorney who can creatively do what you are seeking.",
        "need more facts....i advise my clients to get a legal separation and the reason is debts that maybe your spouse will create during the period of time you live separate and apart...by having a legal separation you can be protected..\nIn reference to the house you can try to enter to an agreement...but even if you love the house it remains community asset and somebody must pay the mortgage..\nEverything in negotiable but always think the potential liabilities for you and your future life",
        "You can make any provisions you agree upon. You can have a legal separation without a judgment of legal separation.\n\nIn all honesty, there's the legal aspect of such a move, and the nonlegal. I'd get input on both."

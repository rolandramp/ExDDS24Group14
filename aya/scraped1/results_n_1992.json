    "answers": [
        "The person to whom the judgment is transferred \"steps in the shoes\" of the original judgment creditor and the lien continues from the date of the original judgment. However, the transfer should be recorded so that the judgment debtor knows who holds the lien. The lien is good for ten years and then must be renewed by the creditor or else it expires.",
        "Renewal of a recorded abstract is not \"automatic\".\nIt is responsibility of third party assignee to renew the judgment by filing an application to renew, giving notice by mail, allowing opportunity to object. Very limited grounds for objection.\nCourt will renew the judgment by issuing an Order which Order is recorded. renewed judgment is good for additional 10 years. Additional 10 year renewals can be obtained in future, Abstract may remain indefinitely.\nConsult BK counsel regarding possible remedies available to remove abstract and avoid liens.",
        "I think you are referring to an assignment of judgment.\n\nIf you wish you may obtain an Amended Abstract of Judgment, correctly calculating the amounts due and to whom. Be certain that you obtain an order substituting the new judgment creditor for the old one.\n\nYou can probably do this by Ex Parte Application.\n\nYou can only renew a judgment once every 5 years or you can wait up to ten years to renew it. Even if you renew it, you still have to file a motion to substitute the real party in interest and file the Amended Abstract to relate back to the abstract that was originally filed.\n\nBe certain to have the last 4 digits of the SSN and Drivers License on the Abstract or Amended Abstract.",
        "No renewal of a recorded abstract is \"automatic\". If the original judgment creditor assigned the judgment to a 3rd party, it is up to the 3rd party to renew the judgment by filing an application to renew judgment, giving you notice by mail and allowing you to object (which hardly anyone does). After the time for the judgment debtor to object has passed, the court renews the judgment by issuing an Order which Order is recorded. The renewed judgment is good for 10 more years. The process can be done again and again, so it is very likely the abstract will remain a lien on any property you own now or acquire in the future. A bankruptcy petition provides some mechanisms to defeat the abstract under certain circumstances."

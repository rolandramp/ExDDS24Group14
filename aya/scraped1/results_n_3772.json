    "title": "My ex is trying to say fraud on my bankruptcy filing!",
    "question": "My ex BOYFRIEND recently won a judgement against me for unheard of reasons for a total amount of 10,300$ I cannot pay for this as well as another 30k in medical debt so I decided to file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. Today he showed up at my meeting of creditors to \"fight\" my case and had the US Trustee question me. I am legally married but separated from my husband but they said they need PROOF and why haven't I filed for divorce. I haven't because I CANT afford it, why else would I be filing for bankruptcy? IM BROKE. they then said they need my husbands financials which he makes way more than me. My lawyers aren't giving me straight answers and just saying all will be fine. they don't understand that my ex will stop at nothing to get his money.",

        "First, until he sues you in bankruptcy court there is nothing to worry about. So just wait and see as if he sues and loses, he may owe YOU for attorney fees possibly too. Second, because you are not living with him, you do NOT have to provide any of his records or income as you are NOT living together and it is not therefore required in the Means Test either. If the trustee wants something, he can request from your separated spouse! Thus, don't worry. Just wait and watch. Showing up at that meeting does not mean ANYTHING!",
        "I'm dealing with a very similar situation in one of my cases right now. This is what we call the \"ex factor\" in bankruptcy. Most cases go very smoothly except when there is a very angry \"ex\" involved. If you feel unsure of what your attorneys are telling you, you can always seek a second opinion from another attorney. Usually these things iron themselves out but it can take time.",
        "Showing up at a 341 meeting like a ranting fool means absolutely nothing, but it does annoy everyone, including the bankruptcy trustee. Unless the fool files an adversary proceeding under 11 USC sec 523 within the time limits imposed (see your form B9A for the deadline to file), he has no case. Filing an adversary action isn't an easy thing to do, and if he loses, he could be ordered to pay for your legal fees. Wouldn't he just love that! Hope this perspective helps!",
        "The reason your attorneys are telling you everything will be fine because...everything will be fine. they don't want to deal with emotions because that's not what you're paying them for, and because bankruptcy attorneys are not inclined to practice hand holding or therapy."

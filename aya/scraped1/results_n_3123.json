    "title": "What is the statue of limitations for court fees in California?",
    "question": "Superior Court just billed me $800 for an investigator the court ordered re; conservatorship of my mother (Alzheimers). The due date of the bill was 12/2/07. This is the first notice I've received. Court says they have been reviewing old cases and submitting bills for unpaid fees. I have no idea of this bill was paid or not and cannot research it due to its age.",
    "answers": [
        "There is no official SOL when it comes to government court debts. Most likely, this fee was supposed to be paid during the Conservatorship, in order for Family Court Services to do their investigation and recommendation to the Probate Court. It appears it was never paid. The state of California is broke and the courts are suffering (department closures, reduced staff, etc.). They want their money.\n\nRecommend you call them and work out some sort of payment plan. Maybe $100 a month?\n\nBest of luck!",
        "Unfortunately I agree with Ms. Straus. Your best bet is to bring up the staleness of the debt, tell them you cannot research it, and see if they will settle it for less.",
        "It's the government. You do the math. I recommend you negotiate this with them."

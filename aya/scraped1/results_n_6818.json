    "title": "Can a debt collector come and knock on your door?",
    "question": "I had a loan with this company and i got late on a payment of about 400 dollars. Im having financial difficulties currently and couldn't make the payment. They are calling me three four times a day. Now they came and knocked on my door. Can they legally do that? Other wise I want to file a lawsuit against them. Please advise.",
    "answers": [
        "Seems to me that calling 3-4 times a day is not reasonable. Contact Mr. Lysle directly for additional help in this arena.",
        "For one solution, you can hire an attorney and let the debt collector know. Contacting you after they know you are represented by counsel may be a law violation (depending on the debt).",
        "The statute uses the word \"unreasonable\" when it prohibits unreasonable conduct. Calling an excessive number of times is a violation. Although coming to your door is not specifically prohibited, it may be \"unreasonable\" under the circumstances.\n\nIf you have a valid claim and file suit, you may be able to recover your attorney's fees from the debt collector.\n\nA few things to check are the identity and solvency of the debt collector and its agents, whether it is a consumer debt, and the circumstances surrounding the debt itself.\n\nYou can send a \"cease and desist\" letter, asking that they stop communicating with you. If they violate that, and continue to contact you, you will have an additional grounds to sue."

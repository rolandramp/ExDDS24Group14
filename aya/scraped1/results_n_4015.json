    "title": "Can the heirs receive their inheritance (such as from sales of real estate) before final distribution?",
    "question": "I read different scenarios that are confusing. In one it said that accounting has to reflect the heirs receiving their share of inheritance but this is before final distribution. The other says that to close probate the heirs have to sign off that they received what was gifted. How and when is the money actually distributed with the estate or real estate if different? Thank you for your time.",
    "answers": [
        "Every estate is different. If there are different assets and not too many debts it is common to have interim distributions for money from sale of stocks, for example. Real estate often takes time to sell, so a final distribution may not occur until the real estate is sold. Beneficiaries are asked to sign waivers and releases for each distribution. Unless there is some reason to suspect improper conduct by the executor it is usually fine to sign them. If there are suspicions it will be necessary for the beneficiary to seek the advice of his or her own attorney.",
        "A partial distribution can be done but it would need to be done under court order. Full distribution must wait until the final accounting is done, approved and there are orders for the final distribution.",
        "No money can be distributed to heirs of a probate without a court order. If distribution is requested before final distribution, it must be by petition to the court. Once final distribution is requested, the personal representative must wait until the court orders that distribution."

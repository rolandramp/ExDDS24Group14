    "question": "I'm a retired vet with a non-service connected disability pension and retirement income. The auto loan has become a personal and financial hardship, so if I just take it back to the car company, will my income be garnished?",

        "Your question does require consideration of your military benfits and retirement income.

Most creditors are willing to negotiate rather than incur the cost of repossessing a vehicle and hiring an attorney to obtain a debt judgment, especially if doing so would throw you into bankruptcy.\n\nI believe a bankruptcy attorney could provide you with a better answer. I will change you question to the debt category.",
        "Without more facts, like the car sucks, they screwed up on the contract disclosures or they lied to you about the car itself in the sale, just bringing it back is called a voluntary repo.

Best military/car fraud attorneys in your immediate area are Rosner, Barry, Babbit, IMHO and if there is any way to help, they can do it. Good luck with it.",
        "In all likelihood, just taking it back is not the best way to go. I agree with Ms. Straus's suggestion. And if the car happens to be worth more than it would take to pay off the loan or only a little bit less, another idea is to sell it and pay off the loan, or if less, maybe negotiate that they would take what you get in full settlement. They may or may not be willing to do that if you explain your circumstances.",

        "I agree with my colleague. More information is needed to determine the answer to your question. An attorney would need to actually look at the contract in order to explain the possibilities to you. I recommend you consult with an attorney in your area.

        "This has nothing to do with military law or your prior service, or veteran status and everything to do with contract law."

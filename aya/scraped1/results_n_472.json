        "You are a creditor if your landlord owes you money. Usually this is not the case in a landlord/tenant relationship, however, if your landlord owes you money then you may want to file a proof of claim in his bankruptcy case. If a chapter 7 was filed, and there are no assets, you will likely not see any money.",

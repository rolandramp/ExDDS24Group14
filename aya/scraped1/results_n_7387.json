    "title": "Lender Lifting Automatic Stay in Chapter 13 Bankruptcy?",
    "question": "I may have to file BK only to stop my Trustee's Sale date in two weeks because the Lender has not postponed or answered on my modification. I am back to work and can now afford my mortgage payment (or a modified one, preferably). I thought if I was in Chapter 13 and arranged to make my mortgage payments with the BK Trustee, the Lender wouldn't or couldn't ask for a Lift. Now I read on Nolo Press that because the Advance Notice is basically gone, they CAN ask the Court to Lift the Stay. NOW I'm getting really worried! Can one of you bright Lawyers give me some more details? Thank You!",

        "The notice requirements of foreclosure vary from state to state. If you received a Notice of Default under California law the document (sent certified, usually 2 or 3 copies) begins a 3 month waiting period. There is another 21 day waiting period after the 3 months. Filing a bankruptcy will stop the bank from taking the next step which is starting the 21 day period.

If you can show the court that you can afford to make those trustee payments plus your current mortgage payments plus your living expenses, and you do make such payments, then there would be no foreclosure.",

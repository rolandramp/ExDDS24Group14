    "title": "Is \"pay for delete\" illegal when trying to clear a past debt with a collection agency?",
    "question": "I called a collection agenct to clear a past debt, I wanted to pay the balance in full in exchange for the collections agency to remove any negative information from my credit history \"pay for delete\". Collection agency said it is illegal, they follow all laws and cannot agree to such terms. W Would there be any advice on how to proceed when dealing with a collection agency and/or have best reflection on credit report other than paying balance in full? Any help is much appreciated. Thank you for your time and God Bless!",

        "Attorney Bunce is correct in that \"Pay to Delete\" is likely prohibited under the contracts that the collection agent has with the credit bureaus.\n\nI would add, however, that the collection agent can only report \"Paid in Collections\" or \"Paid as Agreed\". If its marked \"Paid as Agreed\" there could be confusion because previous reporting may have indicated that the accounts are aged.\n\nThe way they do it is they re-age the account and then they may be able to mark it \"Paid as Agreed\".\n\nThat said even if there is no specific statute that says you cannot, the Business & Professions Code contains sections under 17200 that prohibit practices that are unfair and deceptive. In other words a practice may be legal but still be unfair and deceptive.\n\nYou do not have to pay the debt in full. You can negotiate with the agency and tell them that you believe you only owe so much \"X dollars\" on the debt. If they agree then you arrange in writing to have the debt settled paid in full.\n\nOr you can ignore them and wait till you get a better offer back. Some will settle the debt for a fraction, but there may be tax consequences.",
        "Companies that report to credit bureaus must sign a contract in order to become subscribers to the services of the credit bureaus. I have not seen any of these contracts since I don't represent creditors, but I can imagine that the contract requires the creditors to only report truthful information & that intentionally reporting false information is grounds for cancelling their subscription. So while it may not be \"go to jail\" illegal to \"pay to delete\" it probably is a violation of the subscription agreement and could result in the creditor's loss of its right to receive and post credit information. Hope this perspective helps!",
        "It would be fraudulent to do a pay to delete in my state, and in many states in the Midwest. Whether that is true in CA, you need to hire a CA lawyer.",
        "I agree \"pay for delete\" does not sound legal. It would not accurately report the status of the debt, which your credit report is supposed to do. You can either pay it in full or over time, ignore it and hope they don't sue, or file for bankruptcy to get a fresh start."

    "title": "California chapter 7 bankruptcy; 704 homestead of 100k for families. When does this apply? If living with adult child? etc.?",
    "question": "I am just wondering what the criteria is to be considered a \"family unit\" and take the 100k exemption instead of only the 75k exemption. Would any spouse whether or not on title to the home work? Or what if the debtor lives with 1 or more adult children. How is this determined?",

        "By reading your question makes me believe you have NOT consulted with a bankruptcy attorney. My advice is to do that. You have only 2 goals: to keep everything you have equity in and to discharge all your debts. But there are other issues that can affect your case substantially and thus obtain bankruptcy advice from an attorney who practices ONLY bankruptcy law and has for many years. If you had done that you would already know the answer to your question. However, other issues can exist. For example, if you paid back your relative $3,000 from a personal loan 11 months ago and file bankruptcy next 2 weeks the trustee in bankruptcy assigned your case most likely will go sue your relatives to retrieve that money!! That is just an example. So obtain good advice by employing a good attorney is my advice for you! Most attorneys do NOT charge for that first meeting.",

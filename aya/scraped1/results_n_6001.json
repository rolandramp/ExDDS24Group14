        "I agree with my colleagues above. You should consult with your bankruptcy attorney to see if you signed a reaffirmation agreement. Good luck!",
        "Ford has a habit of taking a hard nose approach with its borrowers that file Chapter 7. If you did not sign a reaffirmation and file it with the court before the discharge came through, it is very unlikely that Ford will let you recover the vehicle by just paying the past due amount. Still there is no harm in trying, so give them a call. Hope this perspective helps!",
        "So did your bankruptcy petition confirm the debt to the car loan lender? Did the lender get notice of the bankruptcy when you filed? If so, they would stopped trying to collect the debt. Your bankruptcy is key to your rights, so you need your bankruptcy lawyer to address this."

Even if the back taxes are not dischargeable in bankruptcy you may be able to settle the tax arrears with an offer in compromise (settlement). Additionally, you may also qualify to have the FTB either put you on currently not collectible status (where they will not actively collect you account by pursuing levies or garnishments, or give you a reasonable opportunity to make small payments under an installment agreement.

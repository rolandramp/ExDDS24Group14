        "First, you need to file an Answer. You will have a court date only if you file an Answer with the court.

        "If you don't file an Answer or if you file an Answer and don't appear for trial, the Court can issue a Default Judgment against you. The creditor can lien your real property, levy your bank accounts or garnish your wages. If possible, call the creditor's attorney to determine whether you can work out a settlement or a payment arrangement. If you have other debts, you may want to consider discharging them in bankruptcy. Good luck.",
        "If you don't file an answer and show-up to court, you can have default, followed by a default judgment, entered against you. Then, once they have a judgment, they can, likely, garnish your wages. Even if you don't have the money to pay them back, you can try to settle with them and/or work-out a payment plan."

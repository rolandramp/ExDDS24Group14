    "title": "Why won't debt collectors provide any written documentation of payment terms verbally agreed on?",
    "question": "The collection company that I am dealing with and I came to an agreement on payment installments and freezing the interest from accruing. Once I finish paying off the principal my interest will be at a set (acceptable) number. However, I CANNOT get them to provide that verbal agreement in writing. They say it's noted on my account and it's recorded on the phone conversations but, they will NOT provide any written documentation. Can someone please advice if this is legal, fair, should i keep pushing for written agreement? Should I even make the payments if they do not provide a written agreement? This is for a medical debt collection. Thank you...",

        "I agree with the other answers. I suggest that if you email them, you also state that if you don't hear back from them by a certain date, you will take that as their agreement to what you have stated.",
        "I agree with Mr. Doland. There is no reason why the company should not be willing to provide even the most basic terms of the agreement in writing, even if it is in an email. One option you could have is send them an email with the basic terms that you specified and ask if this is the Company's understanding of the deal as well.\n\nAt the very least the company should be able to show you the notes on your account.",
        "Insist on it being in writing. Otherwise, it's a scam. You want proof they are the collection agency and the agreement in writing or they can sue you."

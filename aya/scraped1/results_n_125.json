    "title": "Can attorney continue collection of debt after discharged without the trustee's permission?",
    "question": "I have a judgement against my S-Corp company. Few months after judgement my S-Corp company filed bankruptcy and got discharged. After my company got discharge, Attorney for creditor filed an alter ego claim and won. So my company and I are one of the same entity. Attorney for creditor proceeded on collection of debt on me personally without letting the trustee involved. Did the attorney for creditor violated the bankruptcy law for collection of debt after discharged? WHO HAVE STANDING TO PURSUE COLLECTION OF DEBT. TRUSTEE OR CREDITOR'S ATTORNEY??",

        "We have already discussed this. I advised YOU and S corp are NOT the same under the Bankruptcy Code. And your S Corp did NOT receive a discharge..NO corporate debts are ever discharged in ch 7 as a matter of law. But that does not matter. You need to simply sit down with a bankruptcy attorney there to discuss YOU Individually filing bankruptcy. Your personal assets are NOT part of the Corporations bankruptcy. And not notice has to be given to the trustee for the corporation. Simply stated, you should have used an attorney to discuss all this before and now really need to till you understand what that law is. Thus, you can keep asking over and over but the law will not change..and our answers as it is basic law which you are not understanding. Glad you asked here on AVVO too. Good luck.",
        "You probably should have filed personal bankruptcy in addition to, or instead of the S Corp. Not enough facts to be certain. in sny event, this was probably not a violation of the stay because the corporation is a different legal entity from you. You need to speak with a bankruptcy lawyer now to review your options."

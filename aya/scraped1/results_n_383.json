        "My colleagues have given you good advice. Don't do anything without an experienced BK lawyer to help you.\n\nRemember, BK is more than checking boxes on forms you find online. Find/consult/hire a lawyer using the Avvo feature \"Find a Lawyer\". Make a list of 4-5 having many 5 star reviews from satisfied clients. If you don't get a prompt call back from one, go on to the next on your list. Some of us offer a free consultation by phone or in person. Take us up on it.\n\nBecause the bankruptcy process can be handled entirely by phone, email and fax, there is no need to personally visit the lawyer’s office unless you want to. Don’t be limited by the location of the BK lawyers you select.",
        "I agree with my colleague that having dependents may help, as it would allow you to increase the homestead exemption from $75,000 to $100,00.\n\nAs it is, for liquidation analysis, a home valued at $460,000 is estimated to have hypothetical sale costs of 8%, or $36,800. After discounting the value by 8%, there would remain $423,200, from which would be deducted the loan of $311,320 and your homestead of $75,000, leaving net realizable equity of $36,880 (or $11,880 if you have a qualifying dependent entitling you to the $100,000 homesteadd).\n\nIn a hypothetical Chapter 7 liquidation, the trustee would next take administrative fees of 25% of the first $5,000 and 10% of the next $45,000, or a total of $4,438 ($1,938 if you have a dependent). That would leave a hypothetical distribution to unsecured creditors of $32,442 ($9,942 with a dependent).\n\nIf that case, you could keep the home in a Chapter 13 case by making payments over 60 months equal to the hypothetical Chapter 7 distribution. This is referred to as the \"best interests of creditors\" test in a Chapter 13 analysis. That means a monthly payment of $570 ($175 with the dependant), after allowing for the Chapter 13 trustee's fee of 5.5%.\n\nIf you feel you can afford to pay such a monthly Chapter 13 payment in addition to your existing mortgage payment, you should be able to save your home and discharge your debts with a dividend to creditors between 40% and 12% with a dependant to enhance the homestead exemption. The balance of the debts could be discharged.\n\nYou should speak with a qualified bankruptcy attorney who handles Chapter 13 cases as well as Chapter 7 matters. You may be pleasantly surprised.",
        "If you were to file a chapter 13 case, you would be required to pay all of the unsecured debt over a period of 3 or 5 years. If you paid $78,000 over 5 years the payment would be $1,300 a month. If you can pay that amount you may want to talk to a couple of bankruptcy attorneys in your area about whether to file a chapter 13 case.\n\nIf you cannot afford a payment of that size, your only other option is to try and negotiate with the creditors, one at a time. In some cases you may be able to pay a lump sum that is less than the full amount. For others you could make a monthly payment. If that does not work and you wind up being sued by certain creditors, you would need to litigate those cases with the help of a collection defense attorney. (Some litigated cases settle for much less than the full debt amount.) Finally, I would caution against using debt settlement companies, as that would not protect you from being sued, and the fees paid for these services would be better used to pay creditors.",
        "As Mr. Lloyd suggests, a Chapter 13 may be a good option for you.\n\nMany attorneys in your area offer free consultations to discuss debt options. You should take advantage of one (or several) consultations. This is a very important decision for you to make, and you cannot offer the level of detail needed to make an appropriate decision on this site. Talk to an experienced attorney in person to protect your home.",
        "Do you have any dependents at home that you take care of? That may make a difference in the amount of home equity you can protect. A Chapter 13 Bankruptcy maybe a good option for you to consider.\n\nChapter 13 Bankruptcy allows the debtor to keep all their property including homes with a bit of equity. It is a repayment program supervised by the Courts. Sometimes you payback everything and other times you pay back a percentage of what you owe. There are several factors to look at in determining what your proposed Chapter 13 Plan payment would be.\n\nI suggest you contact a bankruptcy attorney and discuss your bankruptcy options.",

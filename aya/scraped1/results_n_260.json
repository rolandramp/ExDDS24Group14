        "My colleagues have provided good information for you. I do urge you to talk with your chapter 13 attorney - if you don't have one, I urge you to get one. Valuation of your house, and other assets, is important for your case and impacts several issues related to the case. Get specific advice about your assets before filing the case.",
        "I agree with colleagues and add:\nEach real property is unique. I generally use current FMV taking into consideration all factors that affect value of your particular property.\nYou are represented. Your attorney in best position to assess all factors related to your property. Review questions with your attorney.",
        "As the owner you are qualified to propose a current value, but if any party in interest challenges the value because it makes a difference in terms of your exemptions, the Court may set an evidentiary hearing and the Court will decide the value. Therefore it may make sense for your attorney to consult with an appraiser.",
        "You should discuss this with your lawyer. Home value is subjective, there is no formula. Usually you can file your case listing the value you believe your home is worth based on its conditions and offers you received can be taken into consideration. If the chapter 13 trustee feels the value is too low he/she may request proof of the value of the home and you will then likely need to get it appraised by a professional. The trustee will then likely go with the appraised value. I agree with my colleague above that the chapter 13 trustee will require you to pay your unsecured creditors as much as they would receive in a chapter 7 liquidation of your home.",
        "The values you chose to use on every asset in your bankruptcy petition is subject to challenges from both the trustee and your creditors. Chose a lowball value, and the cost of defending a challenge may eat up all the money you thought you were savings and damage both you and your attorney's credibility in the future. We call this \"penny wise, pound foolish.\" Hope this perspective helps!",

When looking at the amount of equity in the property above the appropriate exemption, other issues may play into what you have to pay unsecured creditors.

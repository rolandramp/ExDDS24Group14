    "title": "Can I close my single member LLC business if I am threatened with a lawsuit?",
    "question": "I'm in a bit of a bind with a client as a contractor, who may have a few tens of thousands in expenses that may result in them suing me over it. I'm sure if it comes to it, they will try to avoid it and ask me to pay for it, In the event that the amount they ask me is above what I could reasonably accept, and no agreement is reached, can I premptively close my business to avoid having the lawsuit filed against me?",
    "answers": [
        "You shouldn't close your LLC in these circumstances because this is exactly the sort of situation for which LLCs were designed: to protect you personally from business risks and debts. Based on your description, it seems that this client would be suing the LLC, not you personally. If that is the case then they will end up with a judgment against the LLC, not against you (assuming the worst case scenario in which you lose), meaning that while the LLC will lose whatever assets it has, you won't lose your personal assets, like your car or your house.\n\nIf you were to preemptively dissolve the LLC you would \"inherit\" its liabilities, including this lawsuit. If that were to happen, then you would be personally liable for everything and your personal assets would be at risk.",
        "You cannot dissolve an entity (LLC or corporation) without distributing both assets and lliabilities. You would be better off letter the LLC have a judgment against it (without any assets to pay it) than to distribute the liability to yourself personally. This is analysis, not advice.",
        "One of the big advantages of an LLC is the chance to limit your personal liability (although it doesn't limit your liability in the cases of torts in which you personally participate -- if you were to defraud someone through your LLC, you are still personally liable). If you were to dissolve the business, then you would potentially be on the hook for liabilities of the business.\nSpeak with a local lawyer about what the best course is for you. If you think it is expensive to do this, imagine how expensive it is going to be to do it incorrectly."

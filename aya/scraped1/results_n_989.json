        "The other answers are thorough and correct. In the off chance, however, that you're asking how much you have to pay the chapter 13 trustee for his/her services, in most cases, you won't be paying them directly for their services. Trustees receive a portion of the total monthly fee you pay for their work. A good rule of thumb is that the trustee will receive ~11% of the monthly plan payment. So, if your payment to the court each month was $300, the trustee would take approximately $33 of that for their work, and the remaining $267 would be distributed to your creditors. In many cases, a better way to look at it, then, is \"how much will my creditors pay the trustee during my chapter 13?\" since the money you pay is really for them, and the trustee is taking a portion for their work helping the creditors.\n\nThere are certainly exceptions to this hypothetical depending on the total percentage you need to pay to your creditors. The long-story-short answer is that chapter 13 cases are very complex, and people who file without an attorney have a dismal record of success.",
        "As you can see from prior answers, there is no simple answer to your question. Determining your monthly plan payment is one of the most important aspects of a Chapter 13 case; you need to retain an experienced bankruptcy attorney to guide you through the process.",
        "Because you asking this question means you have not met with an attorney and you need to.\n\nThen you will understand why no one can answer your question. How much you make now, in past 6 months, if you have priority income taxes, secured debts and if so if you are late or not and if so whether you want to keep them, size of your household, expected changes, child support, criminal traffic fines, etc..all affect that answer! And all your assets value vs the applicable exemptions for the liquidation test.\n\n\n\n. You care about 2 goals: keeping\neverything you have equity in and discharging all your debts. If you don't have any of the\nexceptions to discharge you will obtain that goal; most exceptions are set forth in 11 USC. 523\n(Google it) like child support, some income taxes, traffic (in a ch 7) and criminal fines , and\npresumption of student loans. But some debts are dischargeable in a ch 13 but NOT in a ch 7 so\nyou want to make sure and your attorney will discuss any such types with you also!\nYour exemptions depend on what state you have lived in in the last 2 years and thus if in your\nstate, then your states exemptions will apply. Most persons filing keep everything they own but\nyour attorney will confirm that with you when they learn everything you own and the equity\nthereof!\nSome secured debts like homes, vehicles, other secured debts an attorney will discuss your\noptions on also as you must list any debts; but that does not mean you will lose them unless you\nhave too much equity or are in default on paying for them! Discuss those options if they apply\nwith your attorney too.\nBut other issues can arise that can greatly harm your case. Just one example: If you paid back a\nrelative $3,000 11 months ago and now file bankruptcy next week, the trustee can SUE that\nrelative to retrieve that $3,000 (under what is called a preference) for the benefit of the\nbankruptcy estate. As a result, most attorneys don't charge to meet with them the first meeting so\nmeet with one no matter what.\nMany great attorneys can be found right here on AVVO in your state so look, call, and meet one\nas soon as you can.\nYou should also want to know when to file: is there an advantage of waiting versus filing now\nand who should you pay between now and then!

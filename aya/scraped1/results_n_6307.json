        "Arbitrators and Mediators are both neutral participants, meaning they do not favor either party and they do not give legal advice to either party.\n\nAn arbitrator will consider your evidence (testimony, documents) subject to the rules of evidence and procedure to which you and the other party agree or as set by the arbitrator. The arbitrator will then make all of the decisions as to how you will divide assets and debts, how much time you will have with your child(ren), and how much support (child/spousal) you will pay or receive. Depending on the terms of the arbitration, the arbitrators decisions can be final orders, binding on all parties, or they can be non-binding, thus giving all parties an idea of how the case may be decided if it goes to trial before a judge.\n\nThere are many different styles of mediation. A facilitative mediator facilitates the discussions so that all parties can make their own agreements. This is done by identifying the items in dispute, each party's underlying interests that fuel their positions, and creating a new way of communicating and understanding the concerns about the disputed items. An evaluate mediator will evaluate the possible outcomes of a case, much as an arbitrator does, so that, when making decisions in mediation, each party understands the potential consequence of not reaching a decision. Some mediators use a combination of these two styles, some are more forceful in pushing for resolution, and some are more focused on having the parties carry the responsibility for reaching agreement. Depending on your mediator's style and effectiveness, you may walk away with new tools on how to handle future conflicts, or you may always need someone else to intervene. Either way, at the end of your mediation, if you have reached an agreement, that agreement can be filed with the court, signed by the judge, thus making it fully enforceable.\n\nBoth arbitration and mediation are confidential processes. Both can result in fully enforceable judgment, and both can keep you out of court. The primary difference is in how you reach that final judgment: either by someone else telling you what it will be, or by you and your spouse telling the court what it will be.\n\nI hope this information is helpful to you. I have attached some links to help you gather more information. Good luck.",
        "Arbitrators are hired judges who have the power to decide who wins and who loses.

        "An arbitrator and a mediator are both supposed to be \"neutral\", i.e., not biased for or against either party.

If they didn't stipulate to binding arbitration, they aren't stuck with the result, but read your arbitration agreement/stipulation before you sign it so that you will know what you are getting into and have the choice of rejecting it.

        "An arbitrator is like a private judge with somewhat looser rules and more flexibility.\nA mediator is like a settlement facilitator who tries to get the parties to settle the issues.\nA neutral is an attorney, independent of the parties, who renders an advisory opinion on the issues.\n\nSometimes arbitrators and mediators are called \"neutrals\" because they are supposed to be, and almost always try to be, as neutral and impartial as possible.",
        "The three have distinct purposes:\n\nAn arbitrator is similar to a \"private Judge\" who may conduct a trial like hearing, accepting evidence, hearing witnesses, etc. At the end of the arbitration, the Arbitrator will make a ruling, decision or award based upon the evidence heard. The rules of evidence at arbitration are generally less stringent than at trial. This depends upon the jurisdiction, the rules under which the arbitrator is conducting the arbitration (i.e., California law or the American Arbitration Association Rules), but s/he will make evidentiary rulings. It is more likely that evidence will be admitted at arbitration than at trial.\n\nA neutral conducts an actual evaluation of the case and so advises the parties, i.e., the value of the case or on the issue of liability (fault).

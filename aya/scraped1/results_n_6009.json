    "title": "How to properly complete items 4 and 5 on California form MC-012 \"Memorandum of Costs\"",
    "question": "When a partial payment is made on a judgment, how are the items 4 and 5 on the next MC-012 completed? In other words, do I wipe the interest amount out on the date of the partial payment and start accruing from zero, and specify only the credit to principal after interest subtracted from payment in \"acknowledgment of credit\", or do I continue to accrue interest - now at a slower rate - and specify full interest in \"declaration of accrued interest\" and full payment amount with no subtractions in \"acknowledgment of credit\"?",

        "Interest accrues at 10% per year on the principal amount (unpaid balance) of the judgment. The \"principal amount\" is the judgment amount plus post-judgment costs (claimed using the Memo of Costs) less partial payments. You should compute interest according to the number of days the principal was unpaid.\n\nAny partial payment is applied first to interest and thereafter to principal.\n\nLet's say your judgment was for $5,000.00 and the debtor made a $2,000.00 payment 31 days after the judgment was entered. You would enter $2,000.00 as the acknowledgment of credit and enter $66.10 as accrued interest, computed as follows:\n\nJudgment $5,000.00 x 10% x 30/365 = $41.10 interest (from date of entry of judgment to Day 30).\nPayment $2,000.00 - $41.10 accrued interest = $1,958.90 applied to principal on Day 30.\nJudgment $5,000.00 - payment toward principal $1,958.90 = $3,041.10 unpaid balance beginning Day 31.\nUnpaid balance $3,041.10 x 10% x 30/365 = $25.00 (from Day 31 to Day 60).\nTotal accrued interest to be reported in the Memo of Costs = $41.10 + $25.00 = $66.10. (Note that you DO include the interest the judgment debtor has paid to date.)",
        "Put the recovered amount into the space for paragraph 4. This figure will also go into paragraph 14 of the writ of execution.\n\nCalculate interest on the original judgment from the date of the judgment to the date of the recovery. Add that interest amount to the original judgment and subtract the payment amount to arrive at the new balance due (for calculating purposes only). Calculate the interest due on the new balance from the date of recovery to the date of the memorandum of costs. Add the two interest amounts. Put that interest total into the space for paragraph 5 of the memo and paragraph 16 of the writ of execution.\n\nBecause the subtotal on the writ of execution, paragraph 15, is the figure used to calculate interest added by the levying officer, the interest figure in paragraph 19a of the writ will be lower than it should be, but you can't do anything about that flaw. At least you will recover the proper amount of interest entered into writ paragraph 16.\n\nFor calculating interest at 10%, I take the judgment amount X .10 and round down to the nearest penny for one year's interest. Then I divide that number by 365 for one day's interest, again rounding down to the nearest penny."

    "title": "I live in CA and I am on permanent Social security disability. I have no assets and barely get by. Am I judgement proof?",
    "question": "I have many old and newer credit card accounts that are sending me collection letters. One even got a judgement against me but has not followed up on it. (I didn't go to the court date). What should I do?",
    "answers": [
        "Creditors cannot touch your social security income. However, if you have other assets, i.e. house, cars, etc., you may want to talk to a lawyer about your situation and rights.",
        "If you have nothing, they can not collect. They may take a debtor’s examination where they will learn about your financial situation.",
        "While it is true that your social security benefits are exempt from collection (with the exception of government student loans), you should use the account into which your benefits are deposited for that purpose only.\n\nIn other words, don't mix in deposits from other sources into that account.\n\nAlso, make sure your bank knows that the account is used only for deposit of your social security benefits, and get them on board that they will not allow any collection attempts from that account.",
        "Those collection accounts will continue to accrue interest and they will continue to send you collection letters. Other assets you have may be vulnerable to those collection accounts. Chapter 7 Bankruptcy can eliminate collection account debts and credit card debts. Talk to a bankruptcy attorney about your financials to determine whether bankruptcy is a good route for you.",
        "Creditors may not levy on account which only contains SS benefits.\nOther assets may be levied.\nConsider C7 BK to eliminate debt."

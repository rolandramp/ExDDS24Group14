    "question": "I read that the unsecured debt limit for a chapter 13 is 354000 or close. What do you do if you owe more and need to file bankruptcy?",
    "answers": [
        "That judgment represents \"non-consumer\" debt so the \"median income\" test will not apply to you. You can file a Chapter 7 but if your disposable monthly income is too great, the Office of the US Trustee might attempt to force you into a Chapter 11. This has been permitted in other jurisdictions, although I'm not aware of any cases in our circuit.\n\nGood luck!\n\nRob",

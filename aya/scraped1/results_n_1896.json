        "The Statute of Limitations applies to the time when a lawsuit was filed. It is an affirmative defense, which means that when you are sued, you must file an Answer alleging violation of the SOL and then prove that defense at trial. If you do not file a Answer (or other pleading) with the court when you are sued, you waive that defense. In your case, a judgment was entered against you. If you were not properly served, you can file a motion to set aside the default, but you should have an attorney represent you in connection with such a motion.",
        "Raising the issue of a time barred debt has to be done as an affirmative defense to the lawsuit. The only way you can stop a wage garnishment is by the collection lawyer withdrawing it, payment in full, or filing a bankruptcy. A bankruptcy will stop it immediately, and the debt will be discharged more than likely. The other thing that can be done is to file a motion in the state court to set the default aside. The facts and circumstances would have to be reviewed. Either way, you should contact a local bankruptcy/debt defense attorney asap. Many offer a free consultation.",
        "I think you are confused. There is a judgment. You first need to discover how that happened without your knowledge.\n\nOnce there is a judgment, interest accrues. You need to seek assistance ASAP."

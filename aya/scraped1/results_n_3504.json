    "title": "Improper summons? Consumer debt collection. $1700. Help??",
    "question": "I had a car pull up and hand a summons for credit card debt suit handed to a friend standing in my doorway while I was out walking the dog. I attempted to settle the \"1700\" for 500 today via telephone and was refused. I am well below federal poverty level, have no assets, and am in economic hardship deferment for student loans. How can I settle with these people or at least buy some time to proceed in court. I requested debt validation about a year ago and was given a copy of my final bill from the original creditor. They did not show validity of each charge. They are suing for interest from 2012, attorneys fees, costs of suit incurred, \"other and further relief\". Help? I would like to settle but they are refusing.",

        "Fighting the service of process will yield very little, and will probably only delay the inevitable. If you spend the time and money to fight the service and win, they will eventually effect proper service (if they don't serve you at the hearing to determine whether the service was proper, they have your address).\n\nYou should file a response to the complaint, and do so within the time stated in the summons. Even if you are negotiating a resolution, do not ignore the deadline for responding to the complaint. If you don't file a response by the date set forth in the summons, the other side can seek a default judgment.\n\nYou should consider contacting an attorney to assist you with the lawsuit and to analyze whether the collection agency or creditor may have violated consumer protection statutes. The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and Rosenthal Act (California's version of the FDCPA) regulate the manner in which debt collectors may attempt to collect debts. Depending on the collector's conduct (what they said, who they spoke with, how often they called, etc.), there could be violations of these laws. If so, you can use the violations as leverage in the lawsuit to get a better result.",

        "Unfortunately, they are under no obligation to settle with you. If you dispute the validity of the debt, you may want to file an answer to the suit. You probably qualify for a \"fee waiver.\" Although service may have been improper, it's best to answer, as it will cost you a significant amount to fight the service or attempt to set aside the judgment later. If you have significant other debts, now may be the time to consult with a bankruptcy attorney in your area.

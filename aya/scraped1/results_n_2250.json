    "title": "How much can i sue a judgment creditor for that fails to file a satisfaction of judgment with the court after receiving payment?",
    "question": "I paid off a judgment over 4 years ago to the creditor/plaintiff & the creditor after receiving full payment of the judgment and written demand by the judgment debtor, failed to execute and file an acknowledgment of satisfaction of the judgment with the clerk of the court in which the judgment was entered within 14 days after receiving the request. As a result the judgment is still on my credit report. If a satisfaction of judgment is now filed with the court, it would remain on my credit report for 7 years from the date it is filed which would continue to negatively impact my credit.",
    "answers": [
        "The procedure is to send a letter with special language, to the judgment creditor, requesting satisfaction of judgment. If they don't file the satisfaction after 15 days, you can get your attorneys fees for filing a motion to force them to. The letter has to be in compliance with the statute though, not so easy for a layman. Get a lawyer.",
        "An adverse judgment will remain on your credit report for 7 years, whether or not it has been satisfied. It does not get removed before that time is up. However, if you satisfied the judgment, the entry which reflects the debt you owed to that creditor should reflect that the amount now owed is zero.\n\nYou can file a motion to force the creditor to file the Satisfaction of Judgment, and seek attorney's fees and costs for the motion. If you think an entry on your credit report is incorrect, you should send a dispute letter via certified mail to the creditor's attorney and each credit reporting agencies that are reporting incorrect information.",
        "You can get your attorney's fees for making a motion to compel the satisfaction, a penalty of $100 and \"all damages\". You might need an expert to opine as to how this has negatively impacted your credit and what that might be worth in finance charges for being subject to higher interest rates, etc.\n\nI'm not a student of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, but I think things are supposed to stay on for seven years from when the debt is originally reported. They are not supposed to be re-reported and thereby the seven year period refreshed. And you may have claims for such activity under the Fair Credit Reporting Act."

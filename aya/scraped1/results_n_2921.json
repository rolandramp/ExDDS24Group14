        "In addition to the excellent suggestions from my colleagues, you can also send a letter to Santander requesting that they \"validate\" the debt they claim you owe. Under both Federal law and California law you are entitled to require the creditor provide documentation to substantiate the debt, and that \"accounting\" must include your payments and any charges they have posted to your account. You can cite both the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (Federal) and the Rosenthal Act (California). Be sure to send you letter via USPS certified mail with return receipt requested.",
        "Ms. Bunce's suggestion to send them a letter is excellent. This letter should come from your bankruptcy attorney. Your efforts to contact them by phone will not help if they later try and take the car. The communications must be in writing so that you have proof.",
        "I agree with my colleague. You will most likely need to contact your bankruptcy attorney and have them mail/email/fax a letter of authorization so Santander will speak with you. Since you did not reaffirm, they probably won't speak to you until this is done. Once they get the authorization into their system, you should be able to speak with someone regarding your concerns. Good luck to you!",
        "Santandor takes the position that if you didn't reaffirm the debt that they can't talk to you. You may need an authorization letter from your attorney to communicate by phone, but I would suggest sending them a letter addressing your concerns. Hope this perspective helps!"

    "title": "If your married and your spouse has a criminal restitution?",
    "question": "If your married and your spouse has a criminal restitution, are we both responsible for the debt if he doesn't pay? Can I get garnished if its not my debt? Is is not safe to file taxes with him?",
    "answers": [
        "Yes. Both spouses areresponsible if not paid.\nYes. Both spouse wages can be garnished if debt not paid. This is based on community property law.\nYou may file joint tax return. However, any federal or state tax refund is subject to interception to pay restitution.",
        "Theoretically, your earnings are community property, meaning that 50% of your earnings belongs to your spouse. But I have never heard of a spouse's earnings being garnished on a criminal restitution order. However, your state income tax refund may be at risk. You should talk to a tax person about your deductions and exemptions so that, in the event that your joint income tax refund is intercepted, the amount taken is small.",
        "Unfortunately the answer is \"yes\". A criminal restitution order becomes a civil judgment and if the debtor does not pay, in CA, his or her spouse's wages may be garnished.\n\nThis is so because CA is a community property state, and therefore debts owed by one spouse either before or during marriage can be satisfied out of community property. Wages are considered community property in CA.\n\nThis situation can be remedied though. If you are the non-debtor spouse, you can file a Ch. 7 bankruptcy, list the restitution, and then discharge your debts, freeing up the community property under your discharge.\n\nThe alternative remedy is for you to either enter into a permanent separation and marital settlement agreement or get a divorce. Divorce is probably a better course of action with respect to future wages.\n\nThe divorce should divide the marital property and debts if possible. If you own any property that has a lien against it to satisfy the restitution order, that will complicate matters considerably.\n\nClick on \"Find a Lawyer\" above and locate a seasoned debt collection defense lawyer in your area who has experience in dealing with criminal restitution orders, bankruptcy and debt collection defense work.",
        "Any community property is liable for the debts of each of the spouse. I suggest you keep your property seprate and if you have prenuptial, use it."

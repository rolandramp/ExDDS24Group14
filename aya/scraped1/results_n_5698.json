    "title": "What happens to hoa fees after foreclosure?",
    "question": "Had a condo in Los Angeles, could not afford to pay HOA fees, or the mortgage, for the last 12 month I was living there. Finally, the bank foreclosed in September 2012. HOA never filed any liens for the fees. Now, HOA is suing me for the unpaid fees up until the date of foreclosure. Can they do that?",
    "answers": [
        "Unlike delinquent property taxes which stay with the real property and its current owner, delinquent HOA fees can follow a person after he or she no longer owns the real property. HOA dues incurred at a certain time are owed by whoever owned the real property at that certain time. Thus, if an owner does not pay the HOA fees for six months, and then the real property is \"lost to the bank,\" six months of HOA dues are owed by that owner who lost the home. The bank will owe HOA dues starting from the moment of foreclosure. The HOA can then attempt to collect the delinquent six months from the previous owner by whatever legal means are available to collect unpaid debts.\n\n- Paul\n\nPaul J.

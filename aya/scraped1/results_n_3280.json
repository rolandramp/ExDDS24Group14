    "title": "Debt collector sent me a letter of intent to sue. Does this mean they will?",
    "question": "I have received a letter of intent to sue, from a debt collector, for a credit card debt. I have told them, I'm 60, unemployed, on Food Stamps and Med-Cal. My only income is from an IRA. I have nothing they can take. I have a mobile home, which has a homestead protection on it. I filed it, years ago. Will they still sue? Should I go to court, if they do file? I can bring records of my financials, to show the court.",

        "Please clarify who used the language \"letter of intent to sue\". It's been my experience that when the debt collector says that, they're saying it to scare you and don't plan to sue. If you're the one that came up with the phrase \"letter of intent to sue\", what makes you think they're planning to sue you? A lot of collection letters come on attorney letterhead and imply that if you don't pay the debt they will look into taking further legal actions. If you received something like that, they aren't getting ready to sue you anytime soon.\n\nI'd be happy to look at the letter for you, for free, just to let you know one way or the other.\n\nBest Regards,\n\nKeren",
        "Record in your county a homestead declaration (see link below) for your mobile home, to ensure it is protected from a judgment lien. If the sue you, consult with a debt collection DEFENSE attorney, so that you are not exposing yourself to an unnecessary judgment, even though they may be unable to collect it from you at this time.\n\nWhen my clients are in your position, the debt collectors will settle for less, even though they filed a lawsuit, because they would rather focus on the folks who have no lawyer and assets or income that they can attach. Of course, each case has unique facts, so your results may vary. Don't make it so easy for the collection agency to get a judgment, if they do file a lawsuit against you. If you are served with a lawsuit, you or your lawyer have only 30 days in which to file a response in court. After that, they may ask the court for a default judgment. Some people do not understand that and wait to show up for a hearing, only to find out that a judgement was entered against them. If the debt has not been paid in several years, there may be a good defense to this debt, known as statute of limitations. Failure to timely defend the lawsuit waives that good defense and any others, once a default judgment is entered.\n\nBy: Robert Stempler (please see DISCLAIMER below)\nCONSUMER LAW OFFICE OF ROBERT STEMPLER\nA Professional Law Corporation",
        "Since federal law governing debt collectors prohibits threatening any action that the collector does not intend to do, they probably will follow suit ( pun intended). You of course have the right to answer and defend. The court won't care much about your finances at this point because your ability to pay is not the issue, only your liabilty. Do you owe the debt, not whether you can pay the debt. If you can convince the collector you are uncollectible they may spare you some of the collection process. However at this point they are not ready to listen. Everybody says they are uncollectible. The collector will go through the court process to prove it before they quit.",
        "The first question I have is how old is the debt?\n\nIf the debt is more than four years old since the last time you made a payment on it, it seems to me your affirmative defense is statute of limitations.\n\nIf they pester you any more, consider filing a Ch. 7 bankruptcy. Sounds like you could wipe out all your extraneous debt so when you make social security in what I gather will be 2 years, you will have discharged these jokers and anyone else.\n\nIf not, they can sue you, and you can defend, and if they win, they get nothing.\n\nClick on \"Find a Lawyer\" above and see if you can locate a bankruptcy lawyer in your area to at the very least consult with you and see if there's any way to address this. Most lawyers don't charge for the initial consultation anyway."

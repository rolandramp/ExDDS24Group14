    "title": "In California, is there a statute of limitations on traffic fine debts? If so, does time start ticking on the date of conviction",
    "question": "Is there a statute of limitations on traffic fines if they never get paid?",
    "answers": [
        "No, the only statute of limitations is between the time of the incident and the time that you are charged.",
        "As pointed out in every other answer, the answer is no - they don't expire and there's no statute of limitations.\n\nTo add one thing as food for thought - if you have fines imposed and fail to pay them, they can also add on civil assessments on top of the fines making matters worse. To add to that, they can notify the DMV about the failure to pay and your license will get suspended. The only way to get the suspension lifted is to pay off the fines completely (not just get on a payment plan).",
        "There is no statute of limitations on fines. SORRY. Good luck to you. Hope this helps?",
        "My colleagues are correct. The answer to your question is an emphatic NO. You need to pay them or they will affect your driving privileges if they have not already. Only way to eliminate that problem is to pay them.",
        "No. They can go on for-ev-er!\n\nIn other words, pay them.",
        "The answer is no. Fines have no statute of limitations."

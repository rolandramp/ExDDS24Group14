        "I concur with the responses given by my colleagues. Closing a case is different from entry of discharge, but the difference is of little importance to you based on what you provided in the post.",
        "I agree with both of the other attys but look at Ms. Julianne's explanation of the difference for more detail.",
        "Your case is essentially over. The closing of your case is the function of court administration. If, however, there is any pending proceedings, that may delay closing. You would know if there was anything pending. Otherwise, just wait for the closing of your case. Check Pacer in a few weeks. You can always call the court administrator assigned to your case.",
        "Your case is generally closed within a couple of weeks of discharge in a no-asset case. You will get a Final Decree which formally closes your case soon. Being \"standard\" means that the discharge covers all your dischargeable debt pursuant to the bankruptcy code.",
        "Getting your discharge has nothing to do with the closing of the case. The case will be closed when your trustee has decided that there is nothing further to administer in the way of assets. If there are no assets, then the trustee still must complete paperwork and sometimes will not file a final report for some time before closing. Most non asset cases are closed within a year, at least in my state."

        "It sounds like maybe you haven't filed your bankruptcy yet, but have been taking time providing information to your attorney. Talk to your attorney about this. If you have already filed your case, the answers given by my colleagues previously will apply.\nIf you don't have an attorney, talk to one in person about this immediately.",
        "You need to consult with a bankruptcy attorney to determine if the funds are exempt or not.",
        "I agree with my colleague. if the lawsuit was from an issue prior to the bankruptcy filing then the money is a part of the bankruptcy estate. If the lawsuit was from an issue that occurred after the bankruptcy filing then the money is not part of the bankruptcy estate. There must also be some reasons why your chapter 7 is still pending 2 years later. I would speak with your attorney right away, or, if you do not have one I would consider retaining an experienced one to assist you through this.",
        "That is a problem is the lawsuit pertains to something that happened before you filed the bankruptcy. If it is a prebankruptcy asset the Trustee takes it. If it arose post bankruptcy it is not part of the bankruptcy. Your attorney should be able to guide you through this. This is not a problem to handle in pro per."

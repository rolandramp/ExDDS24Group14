        "There should be a military attorney on base that can answer this for you. Generally, creditors are not permitted to collect from you during bankruptcy unless you agree to it.",
        "If you are in \"the middle of a bankruptcy,\" then no one should be able to take your tax refund check. If you are just thinking about filing bankruptcy, that is a different story. Talk to your bankruptcy attorney if you have actually filed bankruptcy as this action would be a violation of bankruptcy laws. Hope this perspective helps!",
        "Generally, yes. The STAR card is basically a military-issue credit card (not to be confused with the STAR-branded Chase M/C card) which allows active-duty and retired military (and CG) members, and their dependants, credit as base exchanges and on-line. The member agreement with STAR, however, is more broad than a typical credit card, and it does allow the transfer of defaulted debt to the Treasury Dept. for collection as a governmental debt. This is why your tax refund is being hit, and it does allow them to garnish your disability benefits as well. I'd say it will be very difficult to discharge in bankruptcy as well since it would be considered a governmental debt."

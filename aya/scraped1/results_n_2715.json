    "question": "Just now, after almost a year since filing, that my spouse plans to charge me for Epstein credits since I am the one that remained in the house. (Their choice to leave, not \"kicked\" out) Looking at it from a fair market value of potential rental income - the home is not in any shape to be rented. There are two broken windows, broken patio door screens, no flooring (just the concrete slab) in the living areas. The garbage disposal and dishwasher are broken, the stove face needs replacing, though it works. The furnace and A/C have not been run in over 25 years, so who knows. I am barely making ends meet now, and the house is upside down in the mortgage, there is no way on earth I could afford to make the house up to code to be able to rent it. Please can someone explain this process.",

        "It sounds as if your ex is attempting to make a claim for the differential between your house payment and the fair rental value of the property. The house is not a condition to be rented, so all in all, it sounds like an illusionary argument. If he moves forward in this direction, just make sure you produce clear evidence of the exact condition of the property, why it is not legally rentable, and if it can be rented it would be for a minimal amount of money from which you derive no reimbursement.",
        "The rental value of the house is more properly referred to as a Watts credit. And the calculation of fair rental value is the market rental rate (and yes, the condition of the house is relevant) MINUS the mortgage, taxes, and home owners' insurance. In short, the net profit that you'd make as a landlord, were you to rent the place out to third parties. So it's conceivable (and not uncommon) that there simply is no fair rental value to the place.\n\nOnce you determine the rental value, then you would arguably owe your spouse one half of this.\n\nBy the way, unless he put you on prior, written notice that he would be seeking this Watts credit, you should not be liable for it.\n\nAs for Epstein credits, these are claims for reimbursement for the post-separation payment of community debts. So, your spouse were paying the mortgage, property taxes, and home owners' insurance, (or pre-separation credit cards, or whatever), then you could owe them for half of these post-separation payments.",

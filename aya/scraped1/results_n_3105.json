        "If you filed a reaffirmation agreement and the time to rescind that reaff has passed, then you are and will continue to be responsible for the debt. You have the later of the date of your bankruptcy discharge or 60 days after the reaff was entered into the court record after the judge signed off on the reaff. If it before your discharge or 60 days from the entry of the reaff, then I'd suggest you notify the creditor that you are rescinding the reaff and also put a notice in the court record that you are doing so.",
        "This is why you should never sign a reaffirmation on a car note without a detailed understanding of what it means, especially in the event of default.

        "You are responsible for this debt. Your lawyer should never have signed off on a reaffirmation agreement under these circumstances. If it has been less than 60 days since you signed the reaff then you can rescind it and you wouldn't owe the money, but you need to notify the car creditor immediately, today, if you are still within that window. Otherwise you're stuck."

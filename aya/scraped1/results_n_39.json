        "Excellent advice all around! I will emphasize the importance of checking with your attorney regarding avoiding the lien (applies if the lien is for a judgment). Most lawyers will routinely avoid judgment liens as part of your bankruptcy representation. However, if the lawyer has an attorney's lien, then it can't be avoided in bankruptcy. Your question has lots of detail needing analysis. So contact your lawyer asap before you lose any rights to this money.",

Make a list of 4-5 having many 5 star reviews from satisfied clients. If you don't get a prompt call back from one, go on to the next on your list. Some offer a free consultation by phone or in person.",
        "Attorney Rausa has given an excellent analysis of your case. If there is indeed a judgment lien on the property, and it impinges on the exempt equity that you had in the property when you filed bankruptcy, you may be able to avoid the lien by re-opening your case and filing a motion to avoid the lien. Definitely not a DIY project. See the bk lawyer who handled your case. If you didn't have one, you need one now.",

        "I would like to add that if you file your tax returns and receive a refund before filing bankruptcy, the overpayment may be taken out of your refund. This happened to a client of mine recently as they filed their tax returns shortly before filing for bankruptcy and the overpayment was withheld from their tax return.",
        "You can discharge the overpayment. However, to the extent that you filed false statements as to eligibility (i.e., were working and said you were not), the State could sue you for non-dischargeability of that debt. Whether they would do so is the big question in every bankruptcy case. They have a deadline to file their suit. In practical experience, they do not chase after small amounts and your bankruptcy discharge will have the desired effect. I had a client recently with a $25,000 unemployment bill that he discharged without a blink from the Unemployment office. The amount was so high, that I thought it a high degree of likelihood that they would come after him, but they did not do so. You can't expect that will happen in every case. I think he got lucky.",
        "Yes, you can discharge an overpayment owed to a governmental agency, but in some cases the agency will try to set off against future benefits anyway. make sure that the proper parties are notified of the bankruptcy filing. You may need to list the local office, the state office, and possibly the state Attorney General or Comptroller.",
        "In many cases yes, the Chapter 7 can discharge the over payment. However, a notable exception is if there was fraud involved or alleged in the overpayment. Consult with an attorney that can review all the relevant documents and advise you specifically on your case. You can find a referral here on AVVO, with NACA or NACBA or the CA State Bar. Good luck to you.",
        "You can probably discharge the overpayment in a Chapter 7. BK is not a DIY project. Click the Avvo tab \"Find a Lawyer\". Many give you a free case analysis. Good luck."

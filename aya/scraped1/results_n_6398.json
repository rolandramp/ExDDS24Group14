        "Agree with other counsel. Check your credit report too, make sure the loans are being reported correctly as being discharged in bankrutpcy. My knee jerk reaction to a representative telling me this over the phone would have been to laugh out loud. If you can prove that they are attempting to personally collect from you on discharged debt, you can reopen BK case and motion court to sanction creditor for contempt of discharge order. I'd start with a polite letter reminding them that the debt was discharged in your case (attach copy of discharge order). I can't think of anything that would make you liable for this debt other than adversary action in your bankruptcy case claiming fraud, reaffirmation of the loan during the pendency of your case, or post petition refinancing, loan modification application is not refinancing.",

Relief from the stay doesn't change anything about the fact that you have likely discharged your mortgage note. You have ZERO personal obligation to pay the note.

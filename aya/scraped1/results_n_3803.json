        "Actually, the court did you a huge favor because in the judge's view, it was not in your financial interest to keep the car. You can continue to drive it until it is repossessed by the lender. Keep the insurance on it in the meanwhile. Good luck.",
        "You may surrender the vehicle to the creditor without liability for any deficiency - i.e. the difference between the fair market value of the car and the balance owed.",
        "Attorney Larkin states it exactly like it is. I would add you can also just keep driving it for free as long as possible, save the monies normally paid monthly, and use them for a down payment on another vehicle later. Some creditors, very rarely, but some will repossess even if you are totally caught up in payments. Finally, after you no longer have it, cancel your insurance and let the state you live in DOL know you no longer possess it so that if the vehicle is fined for being in the wrong spot you are not charged with it possibly. Good luck. But it is GOOD in most of the attorneys comments on that that a reaffirmation is not great action to take! Enjoy a new used vehicle and be free of that debt on the BMW!",
        "If your reaffirmation agreement was denied and you want to keep the car you can try continuing to make your payments and seeing if the creditor takes any action to repossess the vehicle. If you do not want the car, you can simply return it to the creditor. Since you did not sign a reaffirmation agreement, your remaining obligation under the loan would be discharged in your bankruptcy."

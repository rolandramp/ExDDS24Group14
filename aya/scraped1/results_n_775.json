    "title": "Will i assume my mom's debt if i sponsor her i-130 & i-485?",
    "question": "My Mom comes here on a self sponsored tourist visa. One one of her visits she needed surgery and insurance didn't pay so now she has debt. I am leaning towards filing her i-130 & i-485 adjustment now that she's here as she gets very lonely in home country. Will i assume her debt if i do this without her filiing bankruptcy first? I definitely don't want to do that as that will mean me and my wife lose our hose and cars and start fresh.",

        "A US citizen does not acquire one's parent's medical debt if sponsor their i-130 & i-485",
        "Filing an I-130 (immigrant petition) and an I-864 (affidavit of support) does not do anything to transfer civil/ personal debt. The I-864 however does state that if your mom takes any form of means-tested non-emergency benefits, you can be asked to reimburse the US government for those benefits. If you have any additional questions about this, connect with qualified US immigration counsel.",
        "A sponsor may be required to reimburse the government if the sponsored alien (i.e. foreign national) becomes a public charge. It does not appear that this is case with your mother's medical debt. For more information, consult an immigration lawyer."

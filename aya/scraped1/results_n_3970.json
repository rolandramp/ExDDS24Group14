        "If the co-borrower obtained a discharge back in 2010, then there is no co-borrower on your loan. Therefore, there is no need for the co-borrower to sign. Also, most attorneys will advise against signing a reaffirmation on real estate. If you want to refinance, seek out another lender now.",

        "Your lender may require a reaffirmation agreement but if that's the case you should look for another lender. Even if you sign a reaffirmation agreement, something most attorneys would NEVER advise on a mortgage loan, that does not guarantee you will be able to refinance. Signing a reaffirmation agreement on a mortgage will create personal liability for a debt which would otherwise be discharged in your bankruptcy which may expose you to legal liability in the event of a judicial foreclosure sale down the road. California is a state that allows both judicial and non-judicial foreclosure sales. While the great majority of them are non-judicial foreclosure sales, some lenders do utilize the court system to foreclose.\n\nI also believe most judges in California will deny a reaffirmation agreement for a mortgage loan.\n\nBefore you make what could turn out to be a very big mistake, make a consultation with a bankruptcy attorney who can advise you of all the risks and benefits of reaffirming a mortgage."

    "title": "In an Offer in Compromise to IRS, as an S Corp owner, do i declare my income as \"net income from business\" or \"Distribution\"?",
    "question": "I own a California S Corp (Sole owner). The business makes $5,000 a month and profits $3,900. The $3,900 flows to me as income. I am filing an OIC for past tax debts with IRS. I need to know if I am declaring this income as net income from the S-Corp or as a Distribution from the S-Corp?",
    "answers": [
        "Generally speaking, you would report the amounts you receive as distributions from the s-corporation on line 33, in section 7, of Form 433-A (OIC). If you are also an employee of the corporation (i.e., the corporation pays you W2 wages in addition to distributions you receive as owner), then that would be reported in the wages section. However, you would report the actual amounts distributed, not the corporation's net profits. Your ownership interest in the corporation would be listed in section 3 of Form 433-A (OIC).",
        "Mr. Atchley is correct. You also don't indicate if these are personal taxes or business taxes - I assume personal based on your description. I would highly suggest retaining an attorney for something of this magnitude.",
        "When filing an OIC, taxpayer has one shot to negotiate down any existing tax debt. Answering questions about your income is only part of the application. All allowed and allowable deductions should also be properly stated to have the most beneficial and correct offer amount. I'd suggest you consult with a tax attorney. Specifically, if your tax debt is high, the cost of hiring a lawyer would be a good investment."

    "answers": [
        "In my experience, debt collectors and debt buyers often ask for information and records that are not relevant to the issues in the case. Perhaps they do that because, when litigating against defendants who are not represented by attorneys, they can get lots of useful information that will help them down the road, after a judgment. (Bank statements reflect the name of your bank and account number - making it easy for them to levy that bank account. What else would they use that for?)\n\nDocuments that are relevant to a debt collection case include: statements from the creditor, correspondence to/from the creditor. Documents that are not private and NOT relevant: your bank statements, other personal financial records, tax records, employment records. Therefore you might consider objecting to the request as follows:\n\nDefendant objects to this request to the extent that it violates Defendant's right to privacy which is protected by the California Constitution. Defendant further objects to this request on the basis that the documents requested are not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. Defendant will not be producing documents in response to this request.\n\nConsult an attorney if you need further help.",
        "You may have a valid objection, but the validity of your objection depends upon the specifics of your case. The bank statements may be evidence that you acknowledged the debt by making payments, or that you made payments which extended the Statute of Limitations. There are other possible facts. I strongly urge you to just sit down with an attorney now, instead of waiting for the evening before you go to court.",
        "The creditor can most certainly seek this information in discovery. However, some financial information may not be discovered during litigation such as an individuals tax returns.",
        "Yes they can ask. That's how discovery works, and it works both ways. You can also ask for information from the creditor. If you think there's something wrong with the creditor's discovery, then you have to state your objections in a timely manner. If you just don't respond to discovery in a timely manner, then the creditor can file a motion to compel you to respond, seek sanctions against you, and also argue that you have waived your objections. So you need to consult with an attorney instead of trying to handle this case yourself.",
        "Yes they can, but you can object. Hire an attorney to defend you so you know what your rights are."

    "title": "Small estate: how long to wait before filing small estate affidavit and not be liable for other creditor claims?",
    "question": "My dad passed away more than a month ago without a will or assigned representative. I was planning on filing a small estate affidavit with his bank to hopefully get what will be left in his checking account to use for funeral expenses, after the bank settles his credit card debts - which are the only debts I am aware of. I read in AVVO Q&A however, that some claims like medical bills can come later and the one who filed the small estate affidavit can be held liable for the debt if the money was released and spent. How long should we wait before we file? It's been more than 40 days after death which California courts guide said. How do we avoid any liability? Is there liability if it's for his funeral expenses? And how do we find out if there are other claims?",
    "answers": [
        "California Code of Civil Procedure Section 366.2 states that almost all actions again a deceased person must be brought within one year after death. Most creditor claims fall within the one year period other than the taxing authorities and the Department of Health Care Services. So the answer to your question is wait one year to be certain.",
        "You cannot avoid liability. You are responsible for the debts, up the amount you receive by virtue of the small estate affidavit. The bank may exercise its right of set-off. You have no obligation to pay creditors a proportionate share, i.e., you can pick and choose. When the money runs out, advise that the estate is insolvent or simply return the bills unopened marked “deceased.” Unless creditors open an estate and file suit within one year of death, they are out of luck.",
        "Yes. Small estate Affidavit procedure best alternative.\nYes. You may file now because 40 days have elapsed since date of death.\nMonitor mail to collect bills as they come in. Contact creditors and advise of death and minimal/possible negative assets. Many will write off debt if minimal. May negotiate with you if they do not write off entire debt.\nDo not distribute any surplus until after all creditors have been accounted for and settled.\nWait at least one year to distribute surplus to avoid liability for late filed creditor claims.",
        "You can file now since 40 days have passed. Contact the creditors as the bills come in and advise them there will be no probate and the estate is insolvent. Many will write the debt off. Don't distribute any surplus until you know all creditors have been accounted for or a year has passed if you want to ensure no issues."

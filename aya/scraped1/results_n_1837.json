        "Yes. Storage facility has \"Possessory Lien\". May retain goods under lock and key.\nNo. Goods may not be sold during pendency of C13 BK without obtaining relief from BK automatic stay.\nMaybe. C13 BK may result in discharge of pre-petition debt. Depends on terms of C13 plan.\nYes. You are responsible for post-petition debts incurred.\nReview with C13 BK counsel.",
        "Yes, the goods in your storage unit are subject to what is called a \"possessory lien\" which arises by statute when you sign the contract. Your pre-petition balance can be discharged, but the lien will remain on the goods inside the unit. Your Chapter 13 prevents the goods in the unit from being sold unless and until the BK court issues an order lifting the stay. What your options are depends on the value of the property in the unit.",
        "The storage company has a possessory lien and if the company releases the items to you, then the company loses that lien. This type of lien is called a statutory lien. In bankruptcy, you can discharge debt, but only in certain circumstances can you avoid or set aside a lien. The bankruptcy code specifically states that you cannot avoid statutory liens.\n\nIt is possible in some instances to recover property on which a creditor holds a possessory lien, but in the few times I have been able to do that for my clients, the property was a vehicle. We had to provide way for the creditor to maintain its lien status by court order setting the amount of the debt, placing the creditor on the title to the auto, and by my client having the creditor shown as a loss payee on the insurance policy. The amount of time that was involved was significant."

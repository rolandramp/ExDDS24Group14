    "answers": [
        "You may want to look at your bankruptcy options. Bankruptcy can prevent the creditor from coming after you further. Bankruptcy erases most debt even if there is a lawsuit or collection judgment entered. Speak with a bankruptcy lawyer as soon as possible so you can better determine if bankruptcy is the right option for you.",
        "Depending on your overall financial situation, Bankruptcy may be right for you. An experienced CA Bankruptcy attorney will be able to determine which type of Bankruptcy, if any is the correct one for you. Use AVVO's Find a Lawyer tool to select a qualified attorney. Good luck. THIS IS NOT LEGAL ADVICE! YOU NEED TO SPEAK TO AN ATTORNEY WHO IS LICENSED IN YOUR STATE FOR LEGAL ADVICE. This is merely suggestions for you to think about in discussing your situation with the local attorney.",
        "They can certainly file the Request, but will likely not get a default judgment entered if the Clerk checks for proper service. Why take the chance. Speak with an attorney about making a limited appearance to challenge service. At this point there may be grounds for dismissal."

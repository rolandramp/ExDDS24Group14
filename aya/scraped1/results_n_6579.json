        "As attorney Bahr indicated, there are two separate issues:\n\n1. You responsibility as a codebtor to repay the loan in case of default of the debtor.\n2. Any agreement you had for your niece's parent to pay or refinance the loan.\n\nYou may be able to seek recourse against the parent if you had some kind of enforceable contract, but that does not eliminate your responsibility to pay the debt.\n\nI recommend speaking to a lawyer to see if you have an enforceable contract with the parent.\n\nIt's a moot point with you, but in general, I advise against cosigning student loans, because the cosigner could be forced to repay without having received any of the benefit of the loan. Also, student loans are very difficult to discharge in bankruptcy, even for codebtors.",
        "You should post the terms of the written agreement with the parents that binds them to cover your losses due to their child's failure to pay. My guess is that there is none. A lesson learned about loaning/guaranteeing loans to relatives.",
        "A co-signer on a loan is free to seek recovery against a non-performing primary signer. However, that does not relieve the co-signer of responsibility for payment on the loan."

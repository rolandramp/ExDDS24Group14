        "Settling a HELOC after foreclosure (assuming there is even actual liability - and in California there may or may not be, depending on many factors) for 20 cents on the dollar is probably a great deal for a bank/lender. If the borrower has other debts, bankruptcy may be something to look into as a way to avoid paying the lender any amount. Most \"BK\" attorneys, my firm included, offer free initial consultations for potential BK clients... thus, there is no reason not to seek the advice of at least one such local BK attorney.\n\n- Paul\n\nPaul J.

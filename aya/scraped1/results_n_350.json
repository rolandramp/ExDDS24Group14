        "Before your Dad files bankruptcy, you need to get advice from a bankruptcy attorney as to your situation. You and your Dad may have interests that conflict in terms of the vehicle and his bankruptcy so it is important to consult with someone on your own. My colleagues have mentioned a few issues related to the vehicle and options for handling. Meeting with an attorney that can analyze the whole situation would be in your and your Dad's best interests.",
        "You probably won't lose the car, but there are a number of factors involved (e.g. how cooperative the car lender will be). Talk to your father's bankruptcy attorney about your options.",
        "Bad news is that it is NOT your car. It is your Dad's car. Hoping you did not make a large down payment and that the car is not worth more than what you owe. I agree with Mr. Yomtov that this issue should be raised with Dad's bankruptcy attorney. There are solutions, but not anonymously online.",
        "Talk to your dad and/or his bankruptcy attorney. Your dad (i.e. you) can reaffirm this secured debt (i.e. the car is collateral), and keep the car, on the condition that the payments get made without fail."

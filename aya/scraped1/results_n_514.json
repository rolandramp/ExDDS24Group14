    "title": "How can I change the dismissal of my civil case to a dismissal with prejudice?",
    "question": "I was a defendant in a civil case, and after filing for bankruptcy and obtaining a complete discharge from the bankruptcy court, the Plaintiff's attorney filed a motion to dismiss without prejudice, and the judge dismissed the case. How can I change the dismissal of my case to a dismissal with prejudice? Thanks!",

        "What would be the purpose of that? It is not necessary. The only thing that matters is the entry of the Order of Discharge in the bankruptcy case. Creditor is enjoined from taking any further action against you. To do so, would be a violation of federal law.",
        "Was this a claim or law suit discharged in the bankruptcy? If so that is what you need to point out to the judge on the motion for reconsideration. If not, the only basis for dismissal with prejudice would be that the dismissal was on the merits or some prejudice that you can describe."

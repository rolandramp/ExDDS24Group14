    "question": "I had surgery two years ago. I've been receiving continuous phone calls I do not answer. I just received a letter saying I owe $1108.32, but they are willing to settle for $1,000.",

        "I am waiting for the part where you tell me how you are being harassed. Really. Having your phone ring is harassing. It is offensive to people who actually have been harassed by a creditor for you to cry harassment if their only offense is to call you back when you refuse to take your head out of the sand. BTW, real harassment is a creditor threatening to press criminal charges against you, or claiming to work with law enforcement, or posting the debt as if it was multiple accounts when if only involved one transaction.\n\nWhat you describe is ordinary lawful debt collection. Owing a debt isn't supposed to be pleasant. And yes it does ruin your credit. Hope this perspective helps!",
        "First, under the Fair Debt Collections Practices Act you have rights. Also in California we have sued debt collectors AND the actual creditor themselves under California's state version of the statute called the Rosenthal Act.\nFurther, if they call you on your cell phone using what is called an \"auto dialer\" or a robo-caller, you may be entitled to recover up to $1,500.00 Per call. For example google the terms \"TCPA and USCB\" and you will see a recent California class action against a debt collector for leaving \"pre-recorded messages\" on the persons cell phone.\nFinally, you can send the debt collector a letter which says you want them to stop calling you, do it by fax or certified mail so you have proof they received it and if they contact you again you may be entitled to collect up to $1,000.00 from them for violating your rights under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA) and up to $1,000.00 under the Rosenthal Act. Additionally these types of cases also pay for your attorneys fees -- so even a single violation is one which most consumer lawyers would be willing to take.",
        "Do you dispute the debt? -- believe you do not owe $1108.38 to medical provider? Being unable to pay does not relieve you of the obligation.\n\nYou can request \"validation\" of the debt in writing, dispute the debt in writing and/or send the debt collector a \"cease and desist\" letter, which will tell the debt collector(s) not to contact you by phone. Look for sample letters online. In the meantime, keep a written record of all the calls and messages. If the debt collectors continue to call after sending a \"cease and desist\" letter, they will be in violation of federal and state law."

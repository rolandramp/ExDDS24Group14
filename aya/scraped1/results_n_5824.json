        "I agree with Atty.

The creditor would then have to properly serve you and you would then have a chance to defend the complaint or work out a settlement, but at any rate the judgment would be vacated and would therefore have to be removed from your credit report. The removal of the judgment from your credit report would probably then restore your credit.",

    "title": "Received a summons from Midland credit MGT with no court date set. I have no $, nothing of value, and depression. What to do?",
    "question": "The summons is from Chase, $5,600. and no court date has been set. I am on unemployment, & feel I have a very low probably of finding work. I am 61 yrs old, have no $ in bank as I also owe the state $. (California) and they have already put a lien on my bank account making me overdrawn. I want to make an Offer in Compromise to the state and my boyfriend says he will help me with this this one time. I rent and my roommate/boyfriend pays for everything. I do not own a car, property or anything else of value. I was recently also diagnosed with major depressive disorder and have a letter from my Dr stating this. If I am forced to go to court the stress could be devastating and I am afraid to see how I would react. Don't know what to do!",

        "Basically, Midland has the problem, not you. Because you have no money, do not pay them anything, or make any promise to pay.\nFile an Answer. Include the Statute of Limitations as an affirmative defense. Also dispute their computations.\nIf you defend yourself in court, the plaintiff (Midland) will have to bring in witnesses to authenticate the credit card agreement, all account statements, etc. If these are offered into evidence by the plaintiff, they must qualify under the business records exception to the hearsay rule. This will require that the plaintiff bring a witness who as personal knowledge of the mode of preparation of these documents and their chain of custody.\nIf you lose in court, Midland will have a civil judgment against you. They cannot force you to pay. The judge will not order you to pay. Midland can get a wage garnishment order, if you are employed. If you have more money in your bank account than you need to pay for your necessities of life, they can try to levy upon that. If you own stocks and bonds that are not protected, they can try to go after your stock brokerage account. If you own several luxury automobiles, they can take the Bentley and the Ferrari. If you do not have any of these luxury items, Midland has the problem. You can just make Midland jump through hoops and waste their time and money. If everyone sued by Midland would do this, Midland would go out of business.\n\nLastly, Midland is a \"debt buyer.\" It paid Chase a couple of cents on the dollar to buy your account, as part of a portfolio of more than a thousand accounts.",

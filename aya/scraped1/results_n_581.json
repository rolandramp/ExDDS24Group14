        "Who is the letter from? If it is the trustee then it looks like the trustee is taking the position that the refund is an asset of the estate, and, if not able to be exempted, can be taken by the trustee. Speak with your attorney to see if you can amend schedule b and schedule c to list and exempt the refund. If the letter is from a different entity then there may be other steps you can take, speak with an attorney to discuss in more detail. Hope this helps.",
        "this is a question you should run by your bankruptcy attorney. Your refund can be an asset of your bankruptcy estate. Generally the refund due to income earned before the filing date is an asset of the estate that can be taken by the trustee. Refund due to income earned after the filing date is normally exempt.",
        "It is unclear from your question exactly what kind of case you were involved in, but I'm going to take a guess that you filed for bankruptcy. This is not a tax law question, so I am changing the category of your question to \"Bankruptcy & Debt\" so you will get more responses.",
        "You should consult with a tax attorney to review the situation."

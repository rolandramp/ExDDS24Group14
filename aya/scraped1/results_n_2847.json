    "title": "What does stipulation for entry of judgement mean? Will it go on my credit?",
    "question": "I was behind in my rent but had the money when we went to court but their attorney said they didnt want to work with us they wanted us out. Their attorney said no lockout prior to 11/3 on the stipulation and the over due rent plus now attorneys fees. I just had back surgery and my mother is a disabled senior and I have three minors. Doing my best to be out but may need a few more days. Will the sheriff come on 11/3 exactly to lock us out? Also I can not pay the judgement amount and move at the same time how will this effect my credit? Is the eviction on there now, because most places wont rent to you if you have one? Please help in a really bad situation and dont know what to do!",

        "Stipulation for entry of judgment is an agreement to allow judgment to be entered without need for trial upon happening of event stated in the stipulation. Sheriff should have already posted notice on your door advising of pending lockout. Yes. Sheriff likely to appear on 11/03 and proceed with lockout. Judgment can appear on credit report. Consider filing C7 BK to avoid the debt and provide some breathing room.\nConsult BK counsel before the date judgment will be entered and lockout.",
        "Before the Sheriff comes, I believe they tack a 5 day notice to vacate on your door. Then they come back on the 5th day and if you're still there, then they put you out. Unfortunately, you will now have the judgment on your record. It will make it harder to rent and will lower your credit score :(\n\nRob",
        "If you file for bankruptcy that would delay the eviction by at least a month or two. But the filing has to be timely - it will be ineffective if judgment for possession has been obtained in the unlawful detainer proceeding. If you have been planning to file for bankruptcy for a while, do not pay them anything - you would be wasting your money.",
        "Expect the Sheriff to arrive at 8:00 A.M. You may have more time, but only because the Sheriff has other cases to do. Sometime the local deputy does all lock outs in your area on a certain day of the week.\n\nIn your situation, you should have received a red-colored Notice to Move, posted by the Sheriff. If not, you will have 5 days after that posting before the Sheriff comes out. You might even have more time if the landlord has not yet gotten the court to enter a formal judgment and issue a Writ of Possession. You can check the court file to see whether a Writ of Possession has been issued. You will not be locked out before the Writ is issued by the court. The landlord needs to pay a $25.00 fee for the Writ, and then pay fees to the Sheriff,\n\nWhen the Sheriff arrives, the Sheriff will give you about 15 minutes to get your personal belongings out of the premises. If you have a pet, and are not at home at the time, the Animal Control will take custody of the animal. The locks will be changed. If you pay storage expenses, you will have 18 days to arrange with the landlord to obtain any abandoned items. If you leave anything of value, and it is not claimed within 18 days, it will be sold at an auction.\n\nIf / when a judgment is issued, it is a public record and will appear on credit reports."

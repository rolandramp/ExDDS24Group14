Due to the differing and smaller dataset, only 3 expert lawyers result, which is too little representation for experts compared to the 61 in the paper. We will therefore adjust the expert criteria slightly. Instead of using the condition of \"user_accepted\", which occurs very rarely, we will use \"helpful\", which denotes how many other platform users (non-lawyers) found the answer useful instead of being question-asker accepted. We will also adjust the limit of across-dataset count of useful answers from 10 to 8."

HOWEVER, this was tried and it leads to a large dataset, making model training even slower. With the available GPU resources, an adjustment was necessary. Therefore we implement an approach that samples a portion of non-relevant lawyers and adds them to the train, validation and test set."
